## Fix Your Maytag Dryer Moisture Sensor Easily

Has your Maytag dryer started leaving clothes damp, even after a full cycle? It is frustrating to pull out clothes that feel cool and clammy. Often, the culprit is a malfunctioning Maytag dryer moisture sensor. This tiny component plays a big role in how well your dryer works. It detects the moisture level in your clothes. It tells the dryer when to stop. When it fails, your dryer might run too long or stop too early. This leads to wasted energy and damp clothes.
