### Why is My Samsung Microwave Humming?

A humming Samsung microwave often indicates one of two things: normal operation or a failing internal component. Components like the magnetron, high-voltage transformer, or cooling fan naturally produce a hum. However, a loud or unusual hum usually signals a part failure, such as a faulty magnetron or a compromised high-voltage system.

### The Normal Sounds of Your Samsung Microwave

Every appliance makes some noise. Your Samsung microwave is no different. It produces various sounds during its operation. Understanding these normal noises helps you tell when something is wrong.

A typical microwave hums quietly. This sound comes from the magnetron and the cooling fan. The magnetron generates the microwaves that heat your food. The cooling fan keeps the internal components from overheating. These sounds are usually consistent and not too loud. If you notice a sudden change in this sound, or if it becomes much louder, then it is time to investigate. Distinguishing between normal operation and a problem is the first step in troubleshooting.

### High-Voltage Component Failures Causing Humming

The high-voltage system in your Samsung microwave is crucial for its operation. It powers the magnetron to generate microwaves. A loud humming noise often comes from issues within this system. Problems with these parts can be serious and require caution.

#### Magnetron Malfunction

The magnetron is the core of your microwave's heating ability. It creates the radio waves that cook your food. When a magnetron starts to fail, it often produces a loud, deep hum. You might also notice that your microwave runs but does not heat food. This is a common sign of a failing magnetron. Replacing a magnetron is a complex task. It often requires a professional technician. Many people encounter their [Samsung microwave turning on but not heating](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-samsung-microwave-turn-on-but-not-heat) when the magnetron has issues.

#### High-Voltage Transformer Problems

The high-voltage transformer steps up the electrical voltage. This is necessary to power the magnetron. If the transformer develops an internal short, it can cause a very loud buzzing or humming sound. You might also notice a burning smell. A failing transformer can draw too much power. This component is very heavy and contains dangerous high voltage. Always unplug your microwave before inspecting it. A faulty transformer often leads to the microwave not working correctly, or even to a complete [Samsung microwave no power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-samsung-microwave-no-power) situation.

#### High-Voltage Diode Issues

The high-voltage diode converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). This conversion is essential for the magnetron to work efficiently. A failing diode can cause the high-voltage capacitor to overcharge. This leads to a loud hum or buzzing noise. The diode might also be shorted, preventing the magnetron from receiving enough power. This component is inexpensive. However, accessing it requires extreme care due to the high voltage.

#### High-Voltage Capacitor Faults

The high-voltage capacitor stores electrical energy. It then releases this energy to power the magnetron. If the capacitor is failing, it can produce a distinct humming or buzzing. It might also swell, leak, or show signs of arcing. A faulty capacitor can cause the microwave to hum loudly but still not heat. Even when unplugged, a capacitor can hold a dangerous electrical charge. You must discharge it safely before handling. Many homeowners find that their [Samsung microwave is not working but has power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-microwave-not-working-but-has-power) when the capacitor is the culprit.

### Mechanical Parts and Fan Noise in Samsung Microwaves

Beyond the high-voltage system, other mechanical components can also cause humming sounds. These parts often involve motors or moving elements. Their failure leads to different types of noise. These issues are often less dangerous than high-voltage problems. However, they still need attention.

#### Cooling Fan or Stirrer Fan Problems

Your Samsung microwave has a cooling fan. This fan circulates air to keep internal components cool. It also prevents overheating. If the fan blades are bent or if debris gets caught in the fan, it can cause a loud humming or rattling sound. Sometimes, the fan motor itself starts to fail. This leads to an inconsistent or louder hum. You might notice the microwave continues to make noise even after cooking stops if the fan is stuck on. This is similar to instances where a [Samsung microwave keeps running](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-samsung-microwave-keep-running). Inspecting and cleaning the fan blades can sometimes resolve this issue.

#### Turntable Motor Issues

The turntable motor rotates the glass tray inside your microwave. This ensures even heating of your food. If this motor wears out or if something obstructs the turntable, it can produce a humming or grinding noise. Check under the turntable for any food debris or foreign objects. Sometimes, simply cleaning the area around the motor can solve the problem. If the motor is faulty, it will need replacement. This is a common cause for noise during operation.

#### Exhaust Fan Operation

Some Samsung microwaves, especially over-the-range models, include an exhaust fan. This fan vents steam and odors away from your kitchen. If this exhaust fan's motor is failing or if its ducting is blocked, it can create a noticeable humming sound. Check the grease filters to ensure they are clean. Blocked vents make the fan work harder, increasing noise. While not directly related to cooking, a loud exhaust fan can be annoying.

### Door Latch and Interlock Switch Problems

The microwave door is more than just an entry point. It contains safety switches. These switches ensure the microwave only operates when the door is securely closed. Problems with the door latch or these interlock switches can also lead to humming. They prevent the microwave from fully engaging its heating cycle.

When you close your microwave door, you might hear a click. This indicates the interlock switches are engaging. If these switches are faulty or misaligned, the microwave may attempt to start but fail to initiate the heating process. This incomplete cycle can manifest as a persistent hum. The hum occurs because power is supplied to some components but not others. The microwave safety system prevents full operation. A faulty door latch often means the interlock switches do not properly close. This can prevent the microwave from turning on, or cause it to hum without heating. This issue is similar to the problems found when a [GE microwave hums when closing the door](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ge-microwave-humming-when-i-close-the-door). Always ensure the door latches firmly before operating your microwave. A loose door is not just noisy; it is a safety hazard.

### Electrical Arcing and Other Internal Issues

Sometimes, the humming sound is not from a failing mechanical part. It can indicate an electrical problem inside the microwave cavity. These issues often involve arcing or loose connections. They require careful attention because they can damage the appliance. Electrical arcing also poses a fire risk.

#### Damaged Waveguide Cover

The waveguide cover is a flat piece inside the microwave cavity. It protects the waveguide, which directs microwaves into the cooking chamber. If food splashes or grease accumulates on this cover, it can burn or get damaged. This damage can cause electrical arcing, leading to a crackling sound along with a hum. You might see sparks inside the microwave during operation. Inspect the waveguide cover for any holes, burns, or discoloration. If damaged, it needs replacement immediately. Using a microwave with a damaged waveguide cover is unsafe.

#### Loose Electrical Connections

Inside your Samsung microwave, many wires connect various components. Over time, or due to vibrations, these connections can become loose. A loose connection can cause poor electrical contact. This can lead to arcing, humming, or even intermittent power supply. The humming sound might be the vibration of the loose wire itself. Or, it could be the result of a component struggling to get consistent power.

Always unplug the microwave before checking internal connections. Only attempt this if you are comfortable working with electrical components. Loose wires can also cause your [Samsung microwave not to turn on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-samsung-microwave-turn-on) at all. Ensuring all connections are secure can resolve many electrical issues and prevent more serious problems.
