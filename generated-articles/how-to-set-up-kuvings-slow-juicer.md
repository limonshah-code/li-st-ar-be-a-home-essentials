Setting up a Kuvings slow juicer involves unboxing, cleaning parts, and assembling them in a specific order. You connect the juicing bowl to the motor, insert the wiper, screen, and auger, then secure the lid. Always check the safety lock before powering on for your first juice.

## Unboxing Your Kuvings Slow Juicer: First Steps

When your Kuvings slow juicer arrives, the first thing to do is open the box. I always enjoy this part, like opening a present. Carefully remove all items from the packaging. It is important to handle parts gently. This prevents any accidental damage before you even begin.

After taking everything out, place the components on a clean, flat surface. This helps you see everything clearly. Keep the packaging materials nearby until you are sure all parts are present and in good condition. You might need the box for storage or future transport. Now, let us check what you have.

### Inventory Check and Initial Inspection

Your Kuvings juicer comes with several parts. You should receive the main motor base, a juicing bowl, a rotation wiper, a juicing screen, an Ultem screw (auger), a hopper/lid, and pulp and juice cups. Depending on your model, you might also find a cleaning brush or extra screens. I find it helpful to refer to the user manual. It lists every piece that should be in the box.

Compare the contents of your box to the manual's list. Check each piece for any signs of damage. Look for cracks, dents, or broken tabs. Sometimes, shipping can be rough on packages. If anything looks damaged or missing, contact Kuvings customer service immediately. They can help you replace parts. This early check saves you trouble later.

### Cleaning Before First Use

Before using any new kitchen appliance, you must clean it. This removes any manufacturing residues or dust. Your Kuvings slow juicer is no different. Do not skip this step. It ensures your first juice is clean and safe to drink.

Take all removable parts and wash them thoroughly. This includes the juicing bowl, rotation wiper, juicing screen, Ultem screw, hopper/lid, and both pulp and juice cups. Use warm, soapy water. A soft sponge or cloth works best. Avoid abrasive scrubbers, as they can scratch the plastic. Rinse everything well to remove all soap. Let the parts air dry completely, or dry them with a clean towel. The motor base does not get wet. Wipe it down with a damp cloth if needed.

## Understanding Your Kuvings Juicer Components

Your Kuvings slow juicer works because of several specialized parts. Knowing what each part does makes assembly easier. It also helps you understand how the juicer extracts juice so effectively. I like to think of it as learning the mechanics of a simple machine. Each piece has a specific job in the juicing process.

This section will introduce you to the main components. We will discuss their function and importance. Kuvings models share many core design elements. For example, [Kuvings offers various models like the EVO820 and C7000](https://homeessentialsguide.com/kuvings-whole-slow-juicer-evo820-vs-c7000), but their basic parts are similar. Understanding these will simplify your setup.

### The Motor Base: Powering Your Juice

The motor base is the heaviest part of your Kuvings juicer. It contains the powerful motor that drives the entire juicing process. This base also has the control buttons, typically an on/off switch and a reverse function. The reverse function is important for clearing clogs. You should never immerse the motor base in water. It is an electrical component.

The motor base has a spindle on top. This spindle connects to the juicing bowl. It spins the Ultem screw, which is the heart of the slow juicing process. Ensure the motor base sits on a stable, flat surface during operation. This prevents vibration and keeps the juicer safe.

### The Juicing Bowl: Collecting the Goodness

The juicing bowl sits directly on top of the motor base. This clear or colored bowl is where all the juicing action happens. It houses the rotation wiper, juicing screen, and the auger. The juicing bowl has two spouts: one for juice and one for pulp. A cap usually covers the juice spout.

The juicing bowl must fit snugly onto the motor base. There are usually alignment marks or a locking mechanism to ensure correct placement. If the bowl is not properly seated, the juicer will not operate. This is a safety feature.

### The Ultem Screw (Auger): The Heart of Mastication

The Ultem screw, also called the auger, is the most distinctive part of a slow juicer. It is a large, spiral-shaped component made from durable Ultem plastic. This screw slowly crushes and presses fruits and vegetables against the juicing screen. This "masticating" action extracts juice efficiently.

The auger is what makes a slow juicer different from a centrifugal juicer. It operates at a low speed, minimizing heat and oxidation. This helps preserve more nutrients and enzymes in your juice. Insert the auger into the center of the juicing screen.

### The Juicing Screen (Strainer): Fine-Tuning Your Juice

The juicing screen is a fine mesh cylinder. It fits inside the juicing bowl, around the auger. As the auger presses produce, the juice passes through the small holes of this screen. The pulp stays inside. Kuvings often provides different screens, such as a fine screen for smooth juice and a coarse screen for thicker juice or smoothies.

The screen determines the texture of your juice. Always make sure the screen is clean and free of debris. Clogged screens reduce juicing efficiency. Proper placement is important for the juicer to work.

### The Rotation Wiper: Keeping Things Clean

The rotation wiper is a small frame with silicone blades. It rotates around the juicing screen as the juicer operates. Its job is to continuously wipe the outside of the screen. This prevents pulp from building up and keeps the juice flowing smoothly into the bowl.

The wiper also mixes different juices if you are combining ingredients. It helps push the juice towards the spout. The silicone blades are gentle and effective. Make sure the wiper arms are intact and not bent.

### The Lid and Feed Chute: Input for Ingredients

The lid sits on top of the juicing bowl assembly. It covers the juicing components. The lid has a feed chute where you drop your fruits and vegetables. Kuvings is famous for its wide feed chutes on many models. This reduces the need for extensive chopping.

The lid also has a safety sensor. The juicer will not start if the lid is not correctly locked into place. This is a crucial safety mechanism. Always ensure the lid clicks or twists securely onto the juicing bowl. A food pusher usually comes with the lid. You use this to gently guide ingredients down the chute.

### Pulp and Juice Cups: Collection Essentials

Your Kuvings juicer comes with two collection cups. One is for the freshly extracted juice, and the other is for the dry pulp. These cups sit under their respective spouts on the juicing bowl. They are designed to fit perfectly under the outlets.

Ensure these cups are in place before you start juicing. Otherwise, you will have a mess. I find it helpful to use larger containers if I plan to make a big batch of juice. [Understanding how Kuvings compares to other brands like Kenwood](https://homeessentialsguide.com/kenwood-slow-juicer-vs-kuvings) can also highlight differences in accessory design.

## Step-by-Step Kuvings Slow Juicer Assembly Guide

Now that you know all the parts, let us put your Kuvings slow juicer together. This process is straightforward. Each part fits into the next in a logical sequence. Following these steps ensures your juicer is ready to work safely and effectively. I have found that a systematic approach prevents mistakes.

It is like building with LEGOs; each piece has its place. Do not force any parts together. If something does not fit easily, check its orientation. Most Kuvings juicers follow a similar assembly pattern. Let's get your juicer ready for action.

### Securing the Juicing Bowl to the Motor Base

First, take your cleaned juicing bowl. Place it onto the motor base. There is usually an arrow or a mark on the juicing bowl. Align this with a corresponding mark on the motor base. Twist the bowl slightly until it locks into place. You will feel or hear a click. This connection must be secure for the juicer to operate.

Some models have a specific slot for the juicing bowl to drop into. Ensure it sits flush and does not wobble. This is the foundation of your juicer's top assembly. A properly seated juicing bowl is the first step toward a successful juicing session.

### Inserting the Rotation Wiper and Juicing Screen

Next, you will assemble the internal components within the juicing bowl. Start with the rotation wiper. Place it into the juicing bowl. The arms of the wiper usually rest on the bottom of the bowl. Make sure the silicone blades are facing inward.

Then, take your desired juicing screen. Slide it inside the rotation wiper. The screen should sit flush at the bottom of the juicing bowl. The wiper will encircle the screen. Double-check that the screen is seated evenly. Any gaps could cause issues during juicing.

### Placing the Ultem Screw (Auger)

Now, it is time for the core of the juicer: the Ultem screw, or auger. Hold the auger and align its bottom with the center hole of the juicing screen. Gently push it down. The auger should slot easily onto the spindle that extends from the motor base. It should spin freely when rotated manually.

The auger usually has a slight wobble when it is not secured by the lid. This is normal. Just ensure it is sitting all the way down. This is the part that will crush your ingredients.

### Attaching the Lid and Feed Chute

Finally, take the lid with the feed chute. Place it on top of the assembled juicing bowl, screen, and auger. There are typically alignment marks on the lid and the juicing bowl. Match these marks. Twist the lid clockwise until it locks securely. You will often hear another click or feel resistance.

The safety mechanism on the lid ensures the juicer will not turn on if it is not locked correctly. This is a vital safety feature. If the juicer does not start, the first thing to check is often the lid's secureness. [Later, you will learn how to take apart your Kuvings juicer for cleaning](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-take-apart-kuvings-juicer), which is the reverse of these assembly steps.

### Final Checks Before Powering On

Before plugging in your Kuvings slow juicer, do a quick visual check.

*   Is the juicing bowl firmly seated on the motor base?
*   Are the rotation wiper, juicing screen, and auger all in place inside the bowl?
*   Is the lid securely locked onto the juicing bowl?
*   Are the pulp and juice cups placed correctly under their respective spouts?
*   Is the power cord free of damage?

Once you confirm everything is in order, you can plug in the juicer. Place your Kuvings juicer on a stable, flat surface away from water. It is now ready for its first juicing adventure. This final check prevents potential issues and ensures safe operation.

## Preparing Your Ingredients for Optimal Juicing

The quality of your juice begins with your ingredients. Proper preparation ensures your Kuvings slow juicer works efficiently. It also maximizes juice yield and helps maintain the machine's longevity. I always say, "garbage in, garbage out" – and that applies to juicing too! Taking a few moments to prepare your produce makes a big difference.

A Kuvings slow juicer can handle a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. However, some simple steps improve the juicing experience significantly. We will cover washing, chopping, and feeding techniques. These steps make your juicing smooth and enjoyable.

### Washing and Chopping Fruits and Vegetables

Always wash your fruits and vegetables thoroughly. Use cool running water. This removes dirt, pesticides, and other unwanted residues. You do not need special produce washes. Just good old-fashioned scrubbing with your hands or a vegetable brush.

Next, consider chopping. While Kuvings juicers often have wide feed chutes, not everything fits. Hard, dense items like carrots or beets should be cut into smaller pieces. This reduces strain on the motor. Long, stringy vegetables like celery or kale benefit from being cut into 1-inch pieces. This prevents them from wrapping around the auger. Remove large seeds or hard pits from fruits like peaches or avocados. Citrus fruits should be peeled. Apples and pears are fine with their cores and skin.

### Dealing with Fibrous Ingredients

Fibrous ingredients, such as celery, ginger, or leafy greens, need special attention. If fed in long strands, they can sometimes tangle around the auger. This can reduce efficiency or even cause a clog. I always cut celery into short, 1-inch segments. For ginger, I peel it and cut it into small chunks.

When juicing leafy greens like kale or spinach, roll them into tight balls. You can also alternate them with harder fruits or vegetables. For example, juice some kale, then a piece of apple, then more kale. This helps push the fibrous material through and cleans the screen. This simple trick improves juice flow.

### Smart Feeding Techniques for Your Kuvings

How you feed ingredients into the chute affects performance. Do not overfill the chute. Feed ingredients one by one. Allow the juicer to process each piece before adding the next. This prevents the motor from straining. The slow juicing process takes time. Be patient.

Use the food pusher gently. You do not need to force ingredients down. The auger will pull them in naturally. Forcing can jam the machine. If you hear the motor struggling, stop and consider using the reverse function briefly. Then, resume juicing. Alternating soft and hard ingredients is a great strategy. For example, juice a soft orange, then a hard carrot. This helps keep the auger and screen clear.

## Your First Juicing Experience with Kuvings

The moment has arrived! Your Kuvings slow juicer is assembled, and your ingredients are prepared. Now, let us make your very first glass of fresh, healthy juice. This initial run helps you get familiar with how your juicer works. It also confirms you set everything up correctly. I remember my first time; it felt like magic watching the juice flow out.

This section covers powering on, feeding ingredients, and what to expect during juicing. We will also discuss what to do if you encounter a common issue. Get ready to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

### Powering On and Safety First

Before you hit the power button, double-check that the juicer is plugged into a grounded outlet. Ensure your hands are dry. Then, press the "ON" button. The motor will hum to life. It will turn the auger slowly. If the juicer does not start, check that the lid is securely locked. The Kuvings juicer has safety sensors. It will not operate if parts are not aligned.

Always keep your fingers away from the feed chute opening while the juicer is running. Use the food pusher that comes with the juicer if you need to guide ingredients. Never use your fingers or other utensils. Safety is important.

### Feeding Ingredients Properly

With the juicer running, start feeding your prepared ingredients into the wide feed chute. Drop them in one piece at a time. Let the auger grab the food and pull it down. Observe the juice flowing from one spout and the pulp ejecting from the other. This is the juicing process in action.

If you are juicing leafy greens, roll them tightly or alternate them with harder fruits. This helps push the greens through. If you are juicing very soft fruits like tomatoes, you might see more pulp in the juice. This is normal for some produce. Do not rush the process. Allow the juicer to work at its own pace.

### Observing the Juicing Process

As the juicer operates, watch the clear juicing bowl. You will see the auger slowly crushing and pressing the ingredients. The juice separates and flows into the juice cup. The dry pulp comes out into the pulp cup. Notice the dryness of the pulp. A dry pulp means efficient juice extraction.

The sound of the juicer should be quiet and steady. Slow juicers are known for being much quieter than traditional centrifugal juicers. Any unusual noises, such as grinding or straining, might indicate an issue. Stop the juicer if you hear anything concerning.

### What to Do If Your Juicer Gets Stuck

Sometimes, a large or tough piece of produce can cause the juicer to slow down or stop. This is a common issue. Do not panic. Your Kuvings juicer has a reverse function for this reason. First, turn the juicer off. Then, switch to the "REV" (reverse) setting. Hold it for a few seconds. This reverses the auger's rotation. It helps to loosen the clog.

After running in reverse, turn the juicer off again. Then switch it back to "ON." Try juicing the remaining ingredients. If it keeps getting stuck, you might need to disassemble the top parts and clear the blockage manually. Always unplug the juicer before touching any internal parts. [If your juicer ever gets stuck, we have a guide for that](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-open-stuck-kuvings-juicer).

### Post-Juicing Disassembly and Cleaning

Once you finish juicing, turn the machine off and unplug it. It is best to clean your Kuvings juicer immediately after use. Fresh pulp is much easier to clean than dried-on pulp. Disassemble the juicer by reversing the assembly steps. Remove the lid, then the auger, screen, and rotation wiper, then the juicing bowl.

Wash all removable parts under warm, running water. Use the cleaning brush provided by Kuvings to scrub the mesh screen. This brush is essential for clearing the small holes. Use soapy water for a thorough clean. Rinse well and let air dry. [Proper cleaning is key after each use](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-juicer-machine) and ensures hygiene. [Knowing how to take apart your Kuvings juicer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-take-apart-kuvings-juicer) is critical for thorough cleaning.

## Maintenance and Care for Your Kuvings Juicer

Keeping your Kuvings slow juicer in top condition ensures it lasts for years. Regular maintenance is not just about cleanliness. It also ensures efficient operation and juice quality. I have found that a little effort after each use goes a long way. Think of it as caring for a valuable tool.

This section covers simple daily cleaning and less frequent deep cleaning. We will also discuss storage tips. These practices will help extend the lifespan of your juicer. You want your Kuvings to be ready whenever you are craving fresh juice.

### Daily Cleaning Rituals

After every juicing session, you should perform a quick clean. This prevents pulp from drying and sticking to parts. Dry pulp is very difficult to remove. Unplug the juicer. Disassemble the juicing bowl, rotation wiper, juicing screen, auger, and lid. Wash these parts under warm, running water.

The cleaning brush is your best friend here. Use it to scrub the mesh screen. Get into all the small holes. Rinse with clear water until no soap remains. Air dry all parts on a drying rack. You can also use a clean towel. For the motor base, wipe it with a damp cloth. Never submerge the motor base in water. This simple routine keeps your juicer ready for its next use. [Regular cleaning keeps your juicer running well](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-juicer-machine).

### Deep Cleaning Practices

Periodically, you might want to give your Kuvings juicer a deeper clean. This is especially true if you juice frequently or handle particularly sticky ingredients. A deep clean helps remove mineral buildup or stubborn stains.
