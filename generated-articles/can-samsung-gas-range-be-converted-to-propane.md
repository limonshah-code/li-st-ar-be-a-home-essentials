## Understanding the Conversion Kit for Samsung Ranges

Converting your Samsung gas range from natural gas to propane requires a specific kit. This kit is essential for safe and proper operation. You cannot simply connect a natural gas range to a propane supply. Propane burns at a higher pressure and heat intensity than natural gas. The appliance needs different parts to handle this difference.

The core components of a Samsung gas range conversion kit typically include:

*   **Propane Orifices:** These are small brass fittings. They regulate the flow of gas to each burner. Natural gas orifices are larger. Propane orifices are smaller. This restriction is necessary because propane is denser and delivered at higher pressure. Each burner, including the oven and broiler, will have specific orifices.
*   **Pressure Regulator Spring:** The gas pressure regulator controls the gas flow to the range. Natural gas regulators operate at a lower pressure. Propane regulators operate at a higher pressure. The kit usually includes a spring or a component to adjust the existing regulator for propane. Sometimes, a whole new regulator is included.
*   **Conversion Instructions:** Detailed, model-specific instructions are always part of the kit. These instructions are vital. They show the exact steps for your Samsung range model.

It is critical to use the correct conversion kit for your specific Samsung model. Universal kits are not recommended. Using the wrong parts creates safety hazards. It can also damage your appliance. You can usually find the correct kit number in your range's owner's manual. If you do not have the manual, check Samsung's support website. You can also contact their customer service with your model number. This ensures you get the right components for a safe and effective conversion.
