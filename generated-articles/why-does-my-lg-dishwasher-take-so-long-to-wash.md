## Why Does My LG Dishwasher Take So Long To Wash?

It is frustrating when your LG dishwasher takes forever to wash dishes. You load the machine, press start, and then hours later, it is still running. I have been there, wondering if my appliance is broken or if this extended wash time is normal. Understanding the reasons behind a long LG dishwasher cycle can help you solve the problem.

Modern LG dishwashers are designed to be energy and water efficient. This often means longer cycle times compared to older models. They use less water and heat, relying on precise sensing and extended soaking to clean dishes thoroughly. However, several common issues can push these already long cycles into overdrive. These problems range from simple user errors like improper loading to more complex mechanical issues. By exploring these factors, you can diagnose what makes your LG dishwasher take so long to wash. This article will guide you through common causes and provide solutions to get your dishwasher running efficiently again.

### Takeaway:

*   Modern LG dishwashers inherently run longer due to efficiency designs.
*   Clogged filters, low water temperature, and poor water pressure often extend wash times.
*   Improper loading or incorrect cycle selection can also make cycles drag on.
*   Sensor malfunctions or drainage issues require specific troubleshooting steps.
*   Regular maintenance and correct usage help maintain optimal cycle durations.

Your LG dishwasher takes a long time to wash because modern models prioritize energy and water efficiency, leading to inherently longer cycles. However, issues like clogged filters, low water temperature, water pressure problems, or sensor malfunctions can further extend wash times significantly.

## Modern Dishwasher Design and Efficiency: Why Longer Cycles are Normal

I remember when dishwashers finished a cycle in under an hour. Today, you might find your LG dishwasher running for two or even three hours. This change is not a sign of a defect in your LG dishwasher. It is a fundamental shift in appliance design driven by efficiency standards. Manufacturers like LG build machines to use less water and energy.

Older dishwashers used a lot of hot water and high pressure to clean. Modern dishwashers take a different approach. They use less water, and they heat it more gradually. This process means that the cleaning action relies more on soaking and extended spray times. The result is a longer wash cycle, but also lower utility bills.

LG dishwashers often feature advanced sensor technology. These sensors detect how dirty your dishes are. If your dishes are very soiled, the dishwasher will automatically extend the wash time. It does this to ensure a thorough clean. This adaptive approach guarantees spotless results but can add significant time to the cycle. Understanding this design choice helps explain why your LG dishwasher takes so long to wash.

It is common for a normal cycle on an LG dishwasher to last between 2 to 3 hours. This duration is typical for many energy-efficient models on the market. Do not be surprised if you see these longer times. The extended cycles are part of their design to save resources. These energy-saving features are good for your wallet and the environment.

## Water Temperature and Heating Issues Affect Wash Time

Water temperature plays a critical role in how long your LG dishwasher takes to wash. Dishwashers need hot water to activate detergents and effectively remove food particles. If the water entering your dishwasher is not hot enough, the machine will work harder and longer. It tries to reach the proper cleaning temperature. This heating process adds considerable time to the overall cycle.

Your LG dishwasher often has an internal heating element. This element heats the water to the optimal temperature during the wash cycle. If this element is faulty or slow to heat, the dishwasher will take much longer to complete its job. Sometimes, the dishwasher will simply wait until the water reaches the target temperature. This waiting period extends the cycle duration. You might notice dishes are not as clean as they should be if the water never gets hot enough.

Check your home's hot water supply. If your water heater is set too low or is far from the kitchen, the water entering the dishwasher might be cold. Running your kitchen faucet on hot for a minute before starting the dishwasher helps. This action ensures hot water is readily available. It prevents the dishwasher from spending extra time heating water from scratch. Issues with the heating element or cold water supply are common reasons why your LG dishwasher takes so long to wash.

Consider the temperature setting on your dishwasher itself. Many LG models have options like "Sanitize" or "High Temp Wash." These settings require the dishwasher to heat water to very high temperatures. While effective for cleaning and sanitization, they will naturally extend the cycle time. Using these specific settings means your machine will run longer by design. Be aware of your chosen cycle and its heating requirements.

## Clogged Filters and Spray Arms: Impeding Cleaning Performance

One of the most common reasons why your LG dishwasher takes so long to wash is a clogged filter or spray arms. These components are essential for effective cleaning. When they become blocked, the dishwasher cannot clean efficiently. This forces it to run longer cycles to try and compensate. I have found this to be a frequent issue in my own appliances.

Your LG dishwasher has a filter system at the bottom. This filter catches food particles and debris during the wash cycle. Over time, grease, food scraps, and even small pieces of plastic can accumulate here. A clogged filter restricts water flow, meaning less water reaches your dishes with less force. The machine senses this poor cleaning action. It then extends the cycle, hoping to achieve cleanliness by running for a longer duration.

Similarly, the spray arms have tiny holes designed to spray water under pressure onto your dishes. If these holes get blocked by food particles or mineral deposits, the water spray becomes weak or misdirected. This prevents proper cleaning. The dishwasher may run extra rinse cycles or prolong the main wash to try and dislodge the grime. This directly impacts how long your LG dishwasher takes to wash. You may also notice your dishes come out less clean.

Cleaning these parts is a simple and effective troubleshooting step. Locate your dishwasher's filter, usually at the bottom of the tub. Remove it according to your LG manual and rinse it under running water. Use a brush to remove stubborn debris. For spray arms, check each hole for clogs. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear any blockages. Regular cleaning, at least once a month, helps maintain optimal performance.

## Drainage System Obstructions: Slowing Down the Cycle

A less obvious but significant reason why your LG dishwasher takes so long to wash involves its drainage system. If water cannot drain properly, the dishwasher struggles to complete cycles. It might even repeat draining attempts, adding considerable time. This issue can also lead to dirty water remaining in the tub. If you notice [why does my LG dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom), a drainage problem is likely.

The drain hose is a common culprit. It can become kinked, crushed, or clogged with food debris and grease. A partially blocked drain hose restricts the flow of water out of the dishwasher. This means the machine takes longer to empty between wash and rinse cycles. It may even pause the cycle if it senses that water is not draining fast enough. This waiting period significantly extends the total wash time.

The drain pump is another critical part of the drainage system. This pump forces water out of the dishwasher and into your home's drain. If the drain pump is failing or has debris stuck in its impeller, it cannot remove water efficiently. The dishwasher's sensors will detect this issue. They might repeatedly try to activate the pump or extend the wash phases. This happens because the machine cannot proceed to the next cycle stage until it is empty.

Another component to check is the air gap, if your plumbing setup includes one. The air gap prevents dirty drain water from flowing back into your dishwasher. It sits on your countertop near the sink. If the air gap becomes clogged, it can impede proper drainage. This can cause the dishwasher to take longer to drain and thus extend the cycle. Resolving these drainage issues is crucial when your [dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/when-dishwasher-does-not-drain) efficiently.

To troubleshoot drainage issues, first check the drain hose for kinks. Ensure it is not crushed behind the dishwasher. If accessible, check the air gap for blockages. For internal clogs, you might need to disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain and clear any debris. If the problem persists, the drain pump might need professional inspection or replacement. Addressing these issues helps restore normal wash cycle times for your LG dishwasher.

## Water Pressure and Inlet Valve Problems

Water pressure is crucial for your LG dishwasher's operation. If the water supply pressure is too low, the dishwasher takes longer to fill. This directly extends the wash cycle time. Modern dishwashers fill with water several times during a cycle. Each slow fill adds precious minutes to the total duration.

The water inlet valve controls water entry into the dishwasher. This valve opens to let water into the tub and closes when enough water has entered. If the inlet valve is faulty, it might not open fully. It could also become clogged with mineral deposits. Both scenarios lead to a slow fill. The dishwasher waits for the correct water level before proceeding. This waiting time makes your LG dishwasher take so long to wash.

You can check your home's water pressure by running a faucet in the kitchen. If the flow seems weak compared to other faucets in your home, you might have a general low water pressure issue. This could be due to municipal supply problems or issues with your home's plumbing. A plumber can assess and advise on whole-house water pressure.

A simple test for the inlet valve involves listening. When the dishwasher is supposed to be filling, do you hear a strong rush of water? Or is it a weak trickle? A weak sound could indicate a partially closed or clogged valve. While cleaning the valve might be possible, a faulty inlet valve often needs replacement. This is usually a task for a service technician.

Ensuring adequate water pressure and a properly functioning inlet valve are key. These elements allow your LG dishwasher to fill quickly and efficiently. Addressing these issues helps prevent unnecessary delays in your wash cycles. It contributes to faster and more efficient dish cleaning.

## Load Size, Dish Placement & Cycle Selection

How you load your LG dishwasher significantly impacts the wash cycle duration. Overloading the machine is a common mistake. When you pack too many dishes inside, water cannot circulate freely. The spray arms struggle to reach all surfaces. This leads to ineffective cleaning. The dishwasher senses that dishes are still dirty and prolongs the wash cycle. It attempts to achieve a better clean.

Improper dish placement also contributes to longer wash times. Dishes should not block the spray arms or detergent dispenser. Large items, like baking sheets or platters, should be placed along the sides. This ensures they do not obstruct water flow to other items. Bowls and cups should be angled downwards. This allows water to drain and prevents pooling. If water pools, the dishwasher may run extra rinse cycles, extending the total time.

The cycle you select directly dictates how long your LG dishwasher takes to wash. LG dishwashers offer various cycle options. Each is designed for different levels of soil and dish types.
*   **Normal Cycle:** This is the most common cycle. It balances cleaning power with efficiency. Its duration typically ranges from 2 to 3 hours.
*   **Heavy Duty Cycle:** For heavily soiled pots and pans, this cycle uses more water, higher temperatures, and longer wash times. It can easily run for 3-4 hours or more.
*   **Sensor/Auto Cycle:** This intelligent cycle uses sensors to detect the soil level of dishes. It then adjusts water usage, temperature, and wash time accordingly. If your dishes are very dirty, this cycle will run longer.
*   **Quick Wash/Express Cycle:** This cycle is designed for lightly soiled dishes that do not require drying. It is much shorter, often under an hour. However, it may not clean effectively if dishes are heavily soiled. Understanding [does quick wash use less water dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-quick-wash-use-less-water-dishwasher) helps in choosing the right cycle.
*   **Rinse Only:** This cycle is for rinsing dishes before a full wash. It does not use detergent or heat. It is a very short cycle.

Always choose the appropriate cycle for your load. Selecting a "Normal" cycle for extremely dirty dishes might lead to a prolonged wash. The dishwasher will try hard to clean them. Conversely, using a "Heavy Duty" cycle for lightly soiled dishes is overkill. It wastes water and energy, and extends the cycle unnecessarily. Optimizing your load and cycle choice helps your LG dishwasher finish in a reasonable time.

## Sensor Malfunctions and Control Board Issues

LG dishwashers rely on various sensors to operate efficiently. These sensors detect things like water temperature, soil level, and water presence. If a sensor malfunctions, it can provide incorrect readings to the control board. This miscommunication often leads to extended wash cycles. The dishwasher might believe dishes are still dirty or water levels are incorrect, prompting it to run longer.

A common sensor issue involves the turbidity sensor. This sensor measures how dirty the water is. If it becomes coated with food debris or detergent residue, it might falsely detect that the water is still very dirty. In response, the dishwasher will continue washing or rinsing for an extended period. It tries to clean what it perceives as excessively dirty water. This directly makes your LG dishwasher take so long to wash.

The thermistor, or temperature sensor, is another critical component. If this sensor fails, the dishwasher might not accurately read the water temperature. It could then over-heat the water or continuously try to heat it. This prolonged heating process adds significant time to the cycle. It also wastes energy. You might notice your dishwasher running for hours, seemingly stuck on a heating phase.

The control board acts as the brain of your LG dishwasher. It receives information from all the sensors and sends commands to other components. A faulty control board can cause erratic behavior. It might incorrectly interpret sensor data or send wrong commands. This can lead to the dishwasher getting stuck in a loop, repeating a cycle step, or simply taking an excessively long time to complete a wash. If your [LG dishwasher countdown](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-countdown) shows unusual behavior, a control board or sensor issue might be the cause.

Diagnosing sensor or control board issues can be complex. Cleaning sensors, especially the turbidity sensor, might solve some problems. However, if a sensor is truly faulty, it requires replacement. Control board problems are usually best left to a professional technician. These are advanced repairs that require specific diagnostic tools and knowledge. If you have ruled out simpler causes, sensor or control board malfunctions might be why your LG dishwasher takes so long to wash.

## Understanding Normal Dishwasher Cycle Times

It is important to set realistic expectations for your LG dishwasher's cycle times. Modern dishwashers are designed to be energy and water efficient. This often translates to longer cycle durations compared to older models. What might seem "too long" to you could actually be the normal operating time for your specific LG model and chosen cycle. I found that my expectations changed after learning more about modern appliance designs.

A "normal" wash cycle on most LG dishwashers typically ranges from 2 hours to 3 hours. Some models, especially those with advanced soil-sensing technology, might run even longer if the dishes are very dirty. This extended time allows for thorough washing, soaking, and rinsing with less water and heat. The dishwasher takes its time to ensure sparkling clean results. If your dishwasher consistently finishes in this range, it is likely operating as intended. You can read more about typical durations for various models in our guide on [how long does a dishwasher take to finish](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-does-a-dishwasher-take-to-finish).

Specialized cycles will naturally extend this duration. For instance, a "Heavy Duty" or "Pots & Pans" cycle can last 3.5 to 4 hours or even more. These cycles use higher temperatures and more vigorous washing actions to tackle tough food residues. The "Sanitize" option also adds significant time. It ensures the water reaches a high enough temperature to kill bacteria. If you frequently use these intensive cycles, you should expect longer wash times.

Conversely, "Quick Wash" or "Express" cycles are designed for speed. They often finish in under an hour. However, these cycles are best for lightly soiled dishes that do not require drying. They use less water and lower temperatures. Using a quick wash for very dirty dishes will not yield good results. It might even force the dishwasher to compensate by running longer if it has soil-sensing capabilities.

To determine if your LG dishwasher's cycle time is truly abnormal, consult your owner's manual. It will list the approximate durations for each cycle option. If your dishwasher consistently runs significantly longer than the manual specifies for a given cycle, even after troubleshooting common issues, then it is time to investigate further. Understanding these baseline times helps you identify when your LG dishwasher takes so long to wash due to an actual problem versus normal operation.
