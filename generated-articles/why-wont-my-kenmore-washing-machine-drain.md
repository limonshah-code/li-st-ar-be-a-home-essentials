## Troubleshooting Your Kenmore: Why Won't It Drain?

Imagine opening your washing machine after a cycle, only to find a tub full of dirty, soapy water. This is a common and frustrating problem for many homeowners. If your Kenmore washing machine won't drain, you are not alone. This issue can disrupt your laundry routine and cause stress. Understanding why your Kenmore washer is failing to drain is the first step toward fixing it.

Many different issues can prevent a Kenmore washing machine from draining properly. It could be a simple clog or a more complex mechanical problem. This article helps you identify the specific cause. We will explore common culprits like clogged filters, blocked hoses, and faulty parts. We also provide clear steps for troubleshooting and repair. By the end, you will know how to get your Kenmore washing machine draining like new again.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Simple Issues First:** Always start by inspecting the drain hose for kinks and clearing the coin trap or pump filter.
*   **Inspect Key Components:** Look into the drain pump, lid switch, and water level sensor as common problem areas.
*   **Consider Electrical Failures:** A faulty control board or motor can also prevent proper drainage.
*   **Ensure Proper Usage:** Overloading or incorrect cycle settings can sometimes stop the drain function.

Your Kenmore washing machine likely won't drain due to a clogged drain pump filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, or a malfunctioning drain pump. Other reasons include issues with the lid switch, water level sensor, or the main control board. You can often fix these problems with basic tools and some troubleshooting steps.

## The Common Culprit: Clogged Drain Pump Filter or Coin Trap

One of the most frequent reasons your Kenmore washing machine won't drain is a clogged drain pump filter or coin trap. This small component stops debris from entering the drain pump. Over time, lint, coins, buttons, and small items accumulate here. This buildup blocks water from passing through.

When the filter clogs, water cannot reach the pump impeller. The washing machine completes its wash cycle but cannot expel the water. This results in standing water inside the tub. Regularly cleaning this filter prevents many draining issues. It is a quick and simple maintenance task.

### Locating and Cleaning the Filter

Finding the drain pump filter depends on your Kenmore model. For front-loaders, it is usually behind a small access panel at the bottom front. For top-loaders, it might be in the tub or under the agitator. Always consult your owner's manual for the exact location.

Before you begin, unplug the washer for safety. Place towels on the floor to catch spilled water. Unscrew the cap slowly to allow water to drain into a shallow pan. Remove the filter and clean it thoroughly under running water. Use a brush to remove all debris.

### Dealing with Foreign Objects

You might find more than just lint in the filter. Small coins, hairpins, or even socks can get trapped. These objects significantly block water flow. Remove any foreign objects you find in the filter housing.

Check the impeller behind the filter as well. Sometimes, small items bypass the filter and get stuck in the pump impeller itself. Use pliers to carefully remove any obstructions. Once clean, reinsert the filter and close the access panel. This simple cleaning often resolves the drainage issue. This issue is similar across various washer brands, as seen in how a [Maytag washing machine won't drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-maytag-washing-machine-drain).

## Obstruction in the Drain Hose: A Hidden Blockage

Another common cause for a Kenmore washing machine not draining is a blockage or kink in the drain hose. This hose carries the dirty water from the washer to your standpipe or utility sink. Any restriction in this hose will prevent water from leaving the tub. It is essential to check this component carefully.

A kink in the hose is often easy to spot and fix. Internal blockages, however, can be harder to detect. These might be caused by accumulated lint, grease, or even mold growth inside the hose. Inspecting and clearing the drain hose is a necessary step in troubleshooting.

### Checking for Kinks and Bends

First, pull your Kenmore washing machine away from the wall. This gives you clear access to the back. Examine the entire length of the drain hose. Look for any sharp bends or crimps.

A hose that is pressed too tightly against the wall can kink. Ensure the hose has a gentle, continuous slope downwards to the drain. Straighten any kinks you find. This simple adjustment often restores proper water flow. Ensure the hose is not pushed too far into the drainpipe either, as this can create a siphon issue.

### Clearing Internal Blockages

If no kinks are present, the hose might have an internal blockage. Disconnect the drain hose from both the washer and the drainpipe. Be ready for some water to spill out. You might want to have a bucket ready.

Inspect both ends of the hose for visible clogs. Use a long, flexible brush or a plumber's snake to clear the inside of the hose. Push the tool through the entire length of the hose to dislodge any debris. You can also try flushing water through it with a garden hose. This helps push out any remaining blockages. Once clear, reattach the hose securely. This thorough check can fix many drainage problems.

## Malfunctioning Drain Pump: The Heart of Your Drainage System

If your Kenmore washing machine still won't drain after checking the filter and hose, the problem might be the drain pump itself. The drain pump is a crucial component. It forces water out of the washing machine at the end of the wash or rinse cycle. If the pump fails, water has nowhere to go.

A drain pump can fail due to electrical issues, a worn-out motor, or physical damage. You might hear strange noises from the pump area when it tries to drain. Or, you might hear no sound at all. Identifying a faulty drain pump is a key step in diagnosing draining issues.

### Signs of a Failing Pump Motor

A failing drain pump often gives specific clues. You might hear a humming sound from the pump without water moving. This indicates the motor is running but the impeller is stuck or broken. Another sign is a loud grinding or whirring noise during the drain cycle. This suggests debris is caught in the pump.

Sometimes, the pump simply makes no sound. This indicates a complete motor failure or a power supply issue to the pump. In severe cases, the pump may even leak water. A visibly corroded or damaged pump often needs replacement.

### Testing the Drain Pump

To test the drain pump, first, unplug your Kenmore washing machine. Access the drain pump, which is usually at the bottom of the machine. You might need to tilt the washer back or remove a front panel. Disconnect the electrical connectors from the pump.

Use a multimeter to test for continuity across the pump's terminals. A lack of continuity means the pump motor is open or has failed. Some pumps also allow you to manually check the impeller. Turn the impeller by hand to see if it spins freely. If it is stiff, clogged, or broken, the pump needs replacement. Replacing a faulty pump is a common repair.

## Lid Switch or Door Lock Assembly Issues

The lid switch (for top-loaders) or door lock assembly (for front-loaders) plays a critical safety role in your Kenmore washing machine. These components prevent the washer from spinning or draining if the lid or door is open. If they malfunction, the machine might not advance to the drain or spin cycle, even if the lid is closed. The washer's control system believes the lid is still open.

This is a common cause for no-drain issues that many people overlook. A faulty switch or lock can be frustrating because the problem is not a clog. Instead, it is an electrical signal that is not being sent correctly. Checking this component is simpler than tearing into the main mechanics.

### How the Lid Switch Affects Draining

For top-loading Kenmore washers, the lid switch is usually located under the main top, near the lid opening. It has a small arm or plunger that gets depressed when the lid closes. This completes an electrical circuit, telling the washer it is safe to operate. If the switch is broken, stuck, or misaligned, the circuit will not complete.

The washer's internal logic will then prevent the spin cycle and drainage. You might notice that the washer fills with water but never progresses to spin or drain. Open the lid and watch the switch mechanism as you close it. Ensure it moves freely and fully engages. Sometimes, a simple adjustment can fix the issue.

### Inspecting the Door Lock

Front-loading Kenmore washing machines use a door lock assembly. This complex component serves two purposes. It locks the door during operation for safety. It also signals the control board that the door is securely closed. If the lock mechanism is faulty, the machine will not spin or drain.

Look for visible damage to the door lock. Check for loose wiring connections. When you close the door, listen for a clear "click" sound. This indicates the lock is engaging. If the door does not lock, or if the washer still shows an "open door" error, the door lock assembly is likely defective. It needs replacement. This issue is similar to common draining problems, like when [your Kenmore washing machine is not draining water properly](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-washing-machine-not-draining).

## Faulty Water Level Sensor or Pressure Switch

Your Kenmore washing machine relies on a water level sensor or pressure switch to know how much water is inside. This sensor tells the control board when the tub is full. It also signals when the water has drained out. If this component malfunctions, the washer might think there is still water in the tub even if it has drained, or it might not even attempt to drain because it never registered as full.

A faulty sensor can send incorrect signals. This causes the machine to get stuck in a cycle. It might continuously try to fill or fail to initiate the drain sequence. Understanding how this part works helps in diagnosing draining issues.

### Understanding Sensor Function

Top-loading Kenmore washers often use a pressure switch. This switch connects to an air dome hose at the bottom of the tub. As water fills the tub, it traps air in the hose. The pressure of this trapped air activates the switch. This signals the water level.

Front-loading Kenmore models usually have a more advanced water level sensor. This sensor electronically measures water presence. If either system is faulty, it will send wrong signals. The washer's brain gets confused. This prevents it from moving to the drain cycle.

### Testing the Pressure Switch

To test a pressure switch, first unplug the washer. Locate the pressure switch, usually near the top of the washer behind the control panel. Disconnect the air tube from the switch. Gently blow into the tube. You should hear a faint click as the switch activates. If you do not hear a click, the switch may be bad.

You can also use a multimeter to test for continuity across the switch terminals while blowing into the tube. A functioning switch will show continuity change. If it does not, replace the switch. Ensure the air tube itself is clear of clogs or kinks. A blocked air tube can mimic a faulty switch.

## Drive Belt Problems and Motor Malfunctions

Sometimes, the reason your Kenmore washing machine won't drain or spin is not directly related to the drainage system. It could be a problem with the drive system. The drive belt connects the motor to the transmission and pump. If the belt is broken, stretched, or loose, the motor might run, but the pump or spin basket will not operate. This prevents both draining and spinning.

A failing motor itself is another possibility. The motor powers both the agitation, spin, and sometimes the drain pump directly. If the motor is not running at all, or if it is running but lacks power, the washer will fail to perform its cycles correctly. Both components are vital for proper machine operation.

### Checking the Drive Belt

To inspect the drive belt, you will need to access the bottom or rear of your Kenmore washer. Unplug the machine first. For most models, you might need to tilt the washer back or remove a front or rear panel. Locate the motor and the large pulley. The drive belt connects these.

Look for signs of wear, fraying, or breakage on the belt. A stretched belt might slip, preventing the drum from spinning fast enough for drainage. If the belt is broken, the motor will run, but nothing else will move. Replace any damaged or worn belt. Ensure the new belt is properly tensioned.

### Motor Overload or Failure

A washing machine motor can fail for several reasons. It might overheat due to continuous heavy loads, causing it to shut down temporarily. Older motors can simply wear out. Sometimes, a capacitor connected to the motor fails. This prevents the motor from starting.

Listen for the motor sound. If you hear a humming but no movement, the motor might be overloaded or seized. If there's no sound at all, check the motor's electrical connections. You can test the motor's windings with a multimeter, but this requires more advanced electrical knowledge. If the motor is confirmed faulty, professional help or replacement is often needed. This general issue is not unique to Kenmore, as seen with some [Whirlpool washing machine issues](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-water-in-whirlpool-washing-machine).

## Sump Hose or Air Gap Blockage

Your Kenmore washing machine has other hoses besides the main drain hose. The sump hose, for instance, connects the bottom of the wash tub to the drain pump. If this hose becomes clogged with lint, debris, or foreign objects, water cannot reach the pump. This directly prevents drainage. Blockages here are less common but just as disruptive as a main drain hose clog.

Additionally, some plumbing setups include an air gap device. This small fixture prevents dirty drain water from siphoning back into your clean water supply. While important for hygiene, an air gap can also get clogged. If this happens, it restricts the flow of wastewater out of the washer.

### Examining the Sump Hose

To check the sump hose, you typically need to access the underside of your washing machine. Unplug the unit and carefully tilt it back. Locate the large, often ribbed hose running from the bottom of the tub to the drain pump. Disconnect it at both ends. Be prepared for residual water.

Inspect the interior of the hose for any blockages. Use a flashlight to look inside. You might find socks, lint balls, or other small items. Clear any obstructions thoroughly. Rinse the hose with water to ensure it is completely clear before reattaching it. Ensure all connections are secure to prevent future leaks.

### Clearing the Air Gap

An air gap is typically found on the countertop near the sink, especially if your washer drains into a sink disposal. It usually looks like a small chrome cylinder with holes. Over time, lint and detergent residue can build up inside. This reduces the outflow capacity.

To clear it, remove the chrome cap. You might need a screwdriver. Inside, you will see the two hose connections. Disconnect the hoses and clear any visible debris. Use a small brush or a piece of wire to dislodge the clog. Reassemble the air gap once it is clear. A clogged air gap can significantly slow down or halt drainage, so this check is important for the entire system.

## Control Board or Timer Failure: When Electronics Fail

Modern Kenmore washing machines rely heavily on electronic control boards or mechanical timers. These components act as the "brain" of the appliance. They manage every stage of the wash cycle, including sensing water levels, controlling motor functions, and initiating the drain cycle. If the control board or timer fails, it can send incorrect signals or no signals at all. This leaves the washer unable to drain.

Diagnosing a control board issue can be tricky without specialized tools. However, certain symptoms can point towards an electronic problem rather than a mechanical one. A failing control board might lead to unpredictable behavior or a complete lack of response from the washer.

### Recognizing Control Board Symptoms

Symptoms of a faulty control board or timer include:
*   **Washer stops mid-cycle:** The machine might pause or completely stop before draining.
*   **Incorrect cycle progression:** It skips drain cycles or gets stuck endlessly filling or washing.
*   **Error codes:** Some Kenmore models display specific error codes that indicate a control board malfunction. Consult your owner's manual for code meanings.
*   **No power or unresponsive buttons:** The machine might not turn on, or buttons may not respond.
*   **Random functions:** The washer might start and stop randomly, or lights might flash erratically.

These issues suggest the internal logic is corrupted or failing. A technician often needs to confirm a control board failure.

### Resetting Your Kenmore Washer

Before replacing an expensive control board, try resetting your Kenmore washing machine. This can sometimes clear minor electronic glitches. The exact reset procedure varies by model.
*   **Basic Power Cycle:** Unplug the washer from the wall outlet for at least 1-5 minutes. Then plug it back in. This simple step often reboots the control system.
*   **Specific Button Resets:** Some Kenmore models have specific button combinations for a hard reset. Check your user manual for details. For instance, some require opening and closing the lid multiple times within a short period, or pressing certain buttons in a sequence.

If a reset does not fix the drainage problem, and all other mechanical parts seem fine, the control board or timer might indeed be the culprit. Replacement is usually required in such cases.

## Cycle Selection Errors and Overloading

Sometimes, the reason your Kenmore washing machine isn't draining isn't a mechanical fault at all. It could be due to how the machine is being used. Incorrect cycle selection or overloading the washer can prevent it from draining properly. Modern washing machines have built-in safeguards to protect themselves.

If the machine detects an imbalance or too much weight, it might stop the cycle. This prevents damage to the motor or suspension. Understanding proper loading and cycle settings is crucial for preventing these simple, yet frustrating, issues. Always refer to your Kenmore owner's manual for specific instructions regarding load sizes and cycle types.

### Ensure Proper Cycle Settings

Check the cycle you have selected. Some delicate or hand-wash cycles might use minimal spin or drain functions. They might leave more water than you expect. Ensure you have chosen a cycle that includes a full drain and spin, such as a "Normal" or "Heavy Duty" cycle.

Also, check if your Kenmore washer has a "drain and spin" only cycle. If it does, try running just this cycle. If the machine drains successfully on this setting, the issue might be with the main wash cycle programming or a sensor that prevents the main cycle from finishing correctly. This simple test helps isolate the problem.

### Avoid Overloading the Machine

Overloading is a common mistake. Stuffing too many clothes into the washer tub impacts its ability to drain efficiently. An overloaded machine can create an imbalanced load during the spin cycle. This imbalance triggers a safety shut-off. The machine stops to prevent damage, often before it completes the drain.

The extra weight also puts excessive strain on the motor and drive system. This can make it difficult for the machine to generate enough centrifugal force to expel all the water. Always load your washer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Leave enough space for clothes to tumble freely. This ensures a proper wash, rinse, and most importantly, a complete drain and spin. Regularly cleaning your Kenmore top-loader can also help with overall performance and prevent issues.
