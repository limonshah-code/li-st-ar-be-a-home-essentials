Contact your local waste management department for details. They will explain how to prepare your microwave for pickup. They will also tell you when to place it at the curb. This service makes disposal easy for residents. It ensures proper handling of bulky items.

### Donating or Selling a Working Microwave

If your microwave still works, throwing it away is a waste. Many people or organizations can use a functioning appliance. Donating or selling extends the life of the microwave. This reduces waste and helps others. It is an environmentally friendly choice.

Before you consider donation or sale, check the microwave's condition. Make sure it operates safely. You should also clean it thoroughly. A clean, working microwave has a better chance of finding a new home. This saves resources and energy.

#### When is a Microwave Still Usable?

A microwave is usable if it powers on and heats food properly. Check for any unusual noises or smells during operation. The door latch should close securely. The control panel should respond to commands. Also, make sure the interior is free from rust or significant damage.

If your microwave has minor cosmetic flaws but works perfectly, it is still usable. A well-maintained microwave can serve a new owner for years. You might find that some older models perform better than newer, more complex ones.
