## Why Your Maytag Dishwasher Blinks

A blinking Maytag dishwasher can feel like a mystery. You just want clean dishes, but instead, your appliance flashes lights. This common problem signals something is not right. It often means the dishwasher tries to tell you about an issue.

Blinking lights are signals or error codes. They show the dishwasher detected a problem during its cycle. My Maytag dishwasher has blinked before, and I understand the frustration. This article explains why your Maytag dishwasher is blinking. We will cover common causes and provide simple steps to fix it. We will also discuss when to call a professional for help.

### Takeaway

*   Check your dishwasher's power supply and reset it.
*   Inspect the door latch and ensure it closes properly.
*   Clear any clogs in the filter or drain hose.
*   Verify the water supply line is open and not kinked.
*   Understand that different blink patterns mean different issues.

A Maytag dishwasher blinks to signal a problem. This problem can be a power interruption, an open door, a drainage issue, or a component failure. The blinking lights act as an error code system. They help you identify what needs attention.

## Decoding Maytag Dishwasher Blinking Lights: What They Mean

Your Maytag dishwasher uses blinking lights to communicate. These flashes are not random. They tell you about a specific issue. Different patterns or lights indicate different problems. Knowing what these blinks mean helps you fix the issue faster.

Some Maytag models use a single light that blinks repeatedly. This light might be "Clean," "Start," or a cycle indicator. The number of blinks often corresponds to an error code. For example, three blinks followed by a pause might mean one thing. Four blinks might mean another. My own dishwasher once had a specific light blinking, and checking the manual helped me understand it.

Other models might flash the entire control panel. This usually signals a general system fault or power issue. Sometimes, just the "Clean" light blinks. This often points to a specific set of problems related to water or drainage. You can learn more about this by reading our article on [why your Maytag dishwasher clean light is blinking](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-maytag-dishwasher-clean-light-blinking).

Your Maytag dishwasher manual is a valuable tool here. It lists specific error codes and their meanings. The manual also provides troubleshooting steps for each code. If you cannot find your physical manual, check the Maytag website. Most manuals are available there as a PDF download. Understanding these signals is the first step to a solution.

## Common Causes Behind a Blinking Maytag Dishwasher

Several common issues can cause your Maytag dishwasher to blink. These problems range from simple user errors to part malfunctions. Identifying the cause helps you choose the right fix. Most blinking issues start with something simple.

One frequent cause is a power supply interruption. A brief power surge or outage can confuse the dishwasher's control board. This might cause the lights to blink. Sometimes, the dishwasher simply needs a fresh start. It is like restarting your computer when it acts up.

An open or improperly latched door can also trigger blinking. Dishwashers have safety sensors. These sensors prevent the machine from running if the door is not fully closed. If the door is slightly ajar, or the latch does not engage, lights will blink. The dishwasher cannot start its cycle safely.

Drainage problems are another common culprit. If water does not drain properly, the dishwasher senses an issue. This can lead to blinking lights. Problems with water supply, such as low pressure or a closed valve, also cause blinking. The machine needs enough water to run its cycles. My dishwasher has blinked for a low water issue before. It stopped when I opened the water valve fully. These are often easy fixes.

*   **Power Fluctuations:** Sudden power changes can disrupt the dishwasher's electronics. This causes it to stop and signal an error.
*   **Door Latch Issues:** If the door is not secure, the dishwasher will not operate. It blinks to alert you.
*   **Water Issues:** Both no water coming in or water not draining out properly trigger warnings. The dishwasher cannot complete its function.

## Troubleshooting Drainage Issues: Why Your Dishwasher Blinks

If your Maytag dishwasher is blinking, especially with certain light patterns, drainage issues are a strong possibility. A dishwasher needs to drain water effectively. If it cannot, water can stand inside. This triggers the machine's safety systems and results in blinking lights.

The most common drainage problem is a clogged filter. Food particles, grease, and debris build up in the filter over time. This prevents water from flowing out. You should regularly clean your dishwasher filter to avoid this. Learning [how to get your Maytag dishwasher filter out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-maytag-dishwasher-filter-out) is a helpful skill. After removing it, you can easily clean it.

Another cause is a blocked drain hose. This hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. It can kink, twist, or become clogged with debris. Check the hose for any visible kinks. You should also ensure the hose connection to your sink drain or disposal is clear. Sometimes, a knock-out plug in a new disposal unit is not removed. This prevents drainage.

A faulty drain pump can also cause issues. The drain pump forces water out of the dishwasher. If it fails, water remains in the tub. This problem usually requires a professional repair. However, checking the filter and drain hose yourself can save you a service call. Regular cleaning can prevent many drainage-related blinking issues. You can find more details on [how to clean your dishwasher filter in a Maytag](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-dishwasher-filter-maytag).

*   **Steps to Check Drainage:**
    1.  **Inspect the filter:** Remove and clean the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.
    2.  **Check the drain hose:** Look for kinks or blockages in the hose behind the dishwasher.
    3.  **Verify air gap (if present):** Ensure the air gap on your sink is clear.
    4.  **Listen to the drain pump:** A failing pump might make unusual noises or no noise at all during the drain cycle.

## Addressing Water Supply Problems in Your Maytag Dishwasher

A blinking Maytag dishwasher can indicate problems with its water supply. Your dishwasher needs a steady flow of water to operate. If it does not get enough water, or no water at all, it will stop and signal an error. The blinking lights are its way of telling you.

First, check the water shut-off valve. This valve is usually under your kitchen sink. It connects to the water supply line for your dishwasher. Make sure the valve is fully open. Sometimes, it gets accidentally turned off during other plumbing work. I once forgot to open this valve after moving my dishwasher, and it blinked furiously.

Next, inspect the water inlet hose. This hose connects the shut-off valve to the dishwasher. Look for any kinks or bends that could restrict water flow. If the hose is old or damaged, it might need replacement. Ensure the hose connections are secure at both ends.

Low water pressure in your home can also be a factor. If the water pressure is too low, the dishwasher might not fill quickly enough. This triggers an error. You can test your home's water pressure by opening a nearby faucet. The flow should be strong and steady. Finally, the water inlet valve inside the dishwasher can fail. This valve controls the flow of water into the tub. If it is clogged or faulty, water cannot enter. A clogged screen on the inlet valve can also restrict water. This issue might require professional help.

*   **Troubleshooting Water Supply:**
    *   Confirm the water shut-off valve is completely open.
    *   Examine the water inlet hose for any kinks or blockages.
    *   Test your home's water pressure to ensure it is adequate.
    *   Consider if the dishwasher's internal water inlet valve might be faulty or clogged.

## Resetting Your Maytag Dishwasher: A First Step Fix

When your Maytag dishwasher starts blinking, a simple reset is often the first and easiest solution. Blinking lights can sometimes be a temporary glitch. A reset clears the control board's memory. This allows the dishwasher to start fresh. Think of it as rebooting a computer.

There are a few ways to reset your Maytag dishwasher. The most common method is a power cycle. This means cutting power to the appliance for a short period. I always try this first when my appliances act up. To do this, locate your dishwasher's circuit breaker in your home's electrical panel. Flip the breaker to the "off" position for one to five minutes. Then, flip it back to "on." This hard reset can clear many minor errors.

If you cannot access the breaker, you can unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet. This is usually possible if your dishwasher is not hard-wired. Wait a few minutes before plugging it back in. This achieves the same power cycle effect.

Some Maytag models also have a button sequence for resetting. You might need to press "Start/Reset" or a combination of buttons for a few seconds. Check your dishwasher's user manual for specific instructions for your model. A reset often resolves issues caused by power flickers or minor sensor misreads. It is a quick and effective troubleshooting step. Our guide on [how to reset Maytag dishwasher blinking lights](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-maytag-dishwasher-blinking-lights) provides more detailed instructions.

*   **How to Reset Your Dishwasher:**
    1.  Turn off the circuit breaker for the dishwasher for 1-5 minutes.
    2.  If the dishwasher is plugged into an outlet, unplug it for a few minutes.
    3.  Check your user manual for any specific button-press reset sequences.
    4.  Restore power and check if the blinking stops.

## Inspecting Door Latches and Sensors for Proper Operation

A blinking Maytag dishwasher often means it thinks its door is not closed. Dishwashers have safety features. These features stop the machine from running if the door is open. The door latch and its sensor play a key role in this. If either component fails, the lights will blink.

First, check the door latch mechanism. Look for any visible damage or misalignment. The latch must engage fully for the dishwasher to start. Sometimes, food debris or grime builds up around the latch. This prevents it from closing properly. Clean the area with a damp cloth. Make sure nothing blocks the latch.

Next, examine the strike plate. This is the part on the dishwasher tub that the latch hooks into. It can sometimes become loose or bent. If it is loose, tighten its screws. If it is bent, it might need gentle reshaping or replacement. A misaligned strike plate prevents the door from closing tightly.

The door sensor detects if the door is shut. If this sensor is faulty, it will not send the correct signal to the control board. The dishwasher will then assume the door is open, even if it is closed. This causes the lights to blink and prevents the cycle from starting. You can test the sensor by trying to start a cycle while gently pushing on the door. If it starts then, the latch or sensor might be the issue. A faulty sensor typically requires replacement.

*   **Checking Door Components:**
    *   Visually inspect the door latch for any damage or obstructions.
    *   Clean any debris from around the latch mechanism and strike plate.
    *   Ensure the door aligns correctly and closes with a firm click.
    *   Consider a faulty door sensor if the latch seems fine but lights still blink.

## Examining Heating Element and Thermistor Issues

When your Maytag dishwasher blinks, it might signal problems with its heating system. The heating element and thermistor work together. They ensure the water reaches the correct temperature. They also dry your dishes. If these parts malfunction, the dishwasher detects an error. This error often appears as blinking lights.

The heating element is a large, circular component at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It heats the water during the wash cycle. It also helps dry dishes during the drying phase. If the heating element is failing, water may not get hot. Dishes might come out wet. The dishwasher's control system senses this lack of heat. It then triggers an error code, which can show as blinking lights. You can visually inspect the element for signs of damage or corrosion.

The thermistor is a temperature sensor. It monitors the water temperature inside the dishwasher. It sends this information to the control board. If the thermistor gives inaccurate readings, the control board might think the water is too hot or too cold. This prevents the dishwasher from continuing its cycle. Incorrect temperature readings can also lead to blinking lights. A faulty thermistor might be harder to diagnose without testing equipment.

Problems with these components usually require more than a simple reset. While you can check for obvious damage to the heating element, testing a thermistor's functionality often needs a multimeter. If your dishes are consistently cold after a wash cycle, or if the drying cycle is ineffective, a heating system issue is likely. These repairs might need a professional technician.

*   **Signs of Heating System Problems:**
    *   Dishwasher lights blink with an error code related to heating.
    *   Water in the dishwasher tub remains cold during cycles.
    *   Dishes do not dry properly at the end of a cycle.
    *   Unusual smells like burning plastic from the heating element.

## Understanding Control Board and Motor Problems

Persistent blinking in your Maytag dishwasher can point to more complex issues. These often involve the control board or the main wash motor. These components are essential for the dishwasher's operation. When they fail, the machine cannot function. It expresses this failure through its blinking lights.

The control board is the "brain" of your dishwasher. It manages all functions, from water intake to cycle timing. If the control board malfunctions, it can send incorrect signals. This leads to erratic behavior, including constant or random blinking. A power surge can damage a control board. Age and wear can also cause it to fail. Diagnosing a faulty control board often involves ruling out all other possible causes. My previous appliance once had a control board issue, and it displayed strange blinking patterns.

The wash motor is another critical component. It powers the spray arms, circulating water throughout the dishwasher. If the motor fails or has issues, water will not spray properly. This means dishes will not get clean. The dishwasher detects this lack of water circulation. It then stops the cycle and displays an error code through blinking lights. Sometimes, the drain motor can also cause blinking if it fails to remove water properly.

These issues are generally not DIY fixes. Replacing a control board or a motor requires technical knowledge. It also requires specific tools. If you have ruled out common problems like drainage, water supply, and door latches, a professional diagnosis is wise. They can accurately identify control board or motor faults. Trying to fix these without experience can cause more damage.

*   **When to Suspect Control Board/Motor:**
    *   Blinking lights show no clear pattern related to simple issues.
    *   The dishwasher does not respond to commands.
    *   You hear the motor making strange noises or no noise at all during a cycle.
    *   All other troubleshooting steps have failed.
