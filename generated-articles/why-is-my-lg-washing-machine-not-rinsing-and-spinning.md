## LG Washing Machine Not Rinsing And Spinning: Common Fixes

It is a frustrating experience when your clothes come out of the washing machine soaking wet. You expect them to be clean, rinsed, and ready for the dryer. However, sometimes your LG washing machine stops rinsing and spinning correctly. This issue leaves you with soggy laundry and a big headache. I understand how disruptive this can be to your daily routine.

This guide explores common reasons why your LG washing machine may not be rinsing and spinning. We will cover simple checks you can perform at home. You will learn about issues like clogged filters, imbalanced loads, and faulty components. My goal is to help you diagnose and fix the problem. You can get your laundry routine back on track.

### Takeaway

*   Check for overloaded or unbalanced laundry loads first.
*   Clean the drain pump filter and inspect the drain hose for clogs.
*   Ensure the washing machine is level and stable.
*   Examine the door lock mechanism for proper engagement.
*   Consider issues with the drain pump, motor, or control board if simpler fixes fail.

Your LG washing machine is not rinsing and spinning often because of a clogged drain pump filter, an unbalanced load, a faulty drain pump, or issues with the door lock mechanism. Addressing these common problems can often restore function.

### Understanding the Rinse and Spin Cycles

The rinse and spin cycles are crucial steps in the washing process. First, the rinse cycle removes detergent and dirt from your clothes. The machine fills with clean water. It agitates the clothes again. This ensures no soap residue remains.

Next, the spin cycle works to extract water from the fabric. The drum spins at high speeds. Centrifugal force pushes water out through the drain. This prepares your clothes for drying. If either of these steps fails, your laundry stays wet. A complete wash cycle depends on both processes working together.

### Clogged Drain Pump Filter

A clogged drain pump filter is a very common reason for rinse and spin failures. This filter traps lint, coins, and small items. These items come off clothes during washing. If the filter becomes blocked, water cannot drain properly. The machine detects standing water. It prevents the spin cycle from starting. This protects the motor and other parts from damage.

Regular cleaning prevents this issue. I advise you to check this filter first. It is usually at the bottom front of your LG washing machine. You might see a small access panel. Open this panel carefully. Have a shallow pan and towels ready. Water will often leak out when you remove the cap. Slowly unscrew the filter cap. Remove any debris you find. Clean the filter under running water. Reinstall it tightly. A clean filter ensures proper drainage. This allows the spin cycle to complete.

### Drain Hose Obstructions

Just like the drain pump filter, the drain hose can also become blocked. A kink or clog in the drain hose stops water flow. This prevents your LG washing machine from draining. If water cannot leave the drum, the spin cycle will not begin. The machine senses the water level is too high. It stops the cycle to prevent overflow.

First, check the drain hose at the back of the machine. Make sure it is not bent or kinked. Ensure it has a gentle slope down to the drain standpipe. Next, disconnect the hose from the wall drain. Look inside for any obstructions. You might find lint, hair, or even small pieces of fabric. Use a flashlight to see clearly. You can also try flushing water through it. This helps clear any blockages. Ensure the hose is properly connected again. Make sure it is not pushed too far into the standpipe. This could create a siphon effect. This can lead to the machine filling up with water again, a common issue some users face.

### Unbalanced Load Issues

An unbalanced load is a frequent culprit for stopping the spin cycle. LG washing machines have sensors. These sensors detect if the load is unevenly distributed. If clothes clump together on one side, the machine shakes too much during spin. This can cause severe vibrations. To prevent damage, the washer stops or significantly slows the spin. It tries to redistribute the load. If it cannot, the cycle will not complete.

I always try to load my machine evenly. Mix large and small items. This helps balance the weight. Do not overload the machine. Overloading makes it harder for clothes to move freely. This increases the chance of imbalance. If your machine stops, open the door. Manually redistribute the items. Close the door and restart the spin cycle. This often resolves the problem quickly. An unbalanced load also leads to problems where the machine might get stuck on the spin cycle.

### Faulty Drain Pump

The drain pump is responsible for expelling water from the drum. If the drain pump is faulty, water will not drain. This prevents the rinse and spin cycles from finishing. You might hear a humming noise but no water movement. Or you might hear nothing at all. A broken pump cannot remove water. The machine then stops the cycle.

You can often diagnose a bad drain pump yourself. Listen for its operation. If it hums but water stays, it might be clogged or damaged. Check for power to the pump. A multimeter can test for voltage. If the pump receives power but does not work, it needs replacement. This is a more complex repair. I recommend contacting a professional if you are unsure. However, for those comfortable with DIY, replacing a drain pump is a common repair. You can find many resources for washing machine repairs if you wish to do it yourself.

### Issues with the Door Lock Mechanism

For safety, LG washing machines will not spin if the door is not securely locked. This is especially true for front-loader models. The door lock mechanism ensures the door stays shut during high-speed spinning. If this lock is broken or faulty, the machine thinks the door is open. It will not proceed to rinse or spin. You might see an error code related to the door.

First, check that the door is firmly closed. Sometimes, clothes can get caught. This prevents a full latch. Make sure nothing blocks the door. If the door closes but the machine still does not spin, the door lock might be defective. Test the door lock with a multimeter. Check for continuity when engaged. If it fails, the part needs replacement. This replacement ensures the machine registers the door as safely closed.

### Malfunctioning Water Level Sensor or Pressure Switch

The water level sensor, also known as the pressure switch, monitors water levels inside the drum. This sensor tells the control board how much water is present. If it malfunctions, it might incorrectly detect too much water. Or it might not detect any water at all. This misreading prevents the machine from advancing. If the sensor thinks the drum is still full, it will not initiate the spin cycle. The washer might endlessly try to drain.

Testing this component requires some technical knowledge. You usually need a multimeter to check for continuity changes. Disconnect the air tube from the pressure switch. Blow into it gently. Listen for a click. This indicates the switch is working. If it does not click, or gives inconsistent readings, it may need replacement. A faulty sensor leads to incorrect cycle progression. Replacing it helps the machine accurately measure water. This ensures proper rinsing and spinning.

### Drive Belt Problems

Many LG washing machines use a drive belt. This belt connects the motor to the wash drum. It transfers power. This power allows the drum to rotate during wash, rinse, and spin cycles. Over time, the drive belt can stretch, slip, or even break. If the belt is loose or damaged, the motor spins, but the drum does not. This means your clothes will not agitate or spin properly.

You can usually inspect the drive belt by removing the rear panel of the washing machine. Look for fraying, cracks, or a completely broken belt. If the belt looks fine, try to push it to see if it has too much slack. A loose belt might slip, especially with a heavy load. Replace any damaged or excessively worn belts. A new belt restores the connection between the motor and drum. This allows for effective spinning.

### Motor or Motor Coupling Issues

The motor is the heart of your LG washing machine. It drives the drum. If the motor itself is faulty, the drum will not spin. Modern LG washers often use Direct Drive motors. These motors are directly attached to the drum. They do not use a belt. This design reduces noise and parts. However, the motor or its coupling can still fail. A failed motor means no rotation.

Symptoms of a bad motor include no drum movement at all. You might hear a loud buzzing or grinding noise from the motor area. On Direct Drive models, a faulty motor rotor or stator can cause this. On belt-driven models, a damaged motor coupling might be the problem. This coupling links the motor to the transmission. Inspect the motor for visible damage. Listen for unusual sounds. Motor repairs or replacements are complex jobs. They require specialized tools. I recommend calling a certified technician for motor issues. This ensures the repair is done safely and correctly.

### Control Board Malfunction

The control board acts as the brain of your LG washing machine. It sends signals to all components. It tells the drain pump when to activate. It signals the motor to spin the drum. If the control board malfunctions, it can send incorrect commands. Or it might not send any commands at all. This results in cycles not completing. For example, it might fail to initiate the spin cycle.

A control board issue is often suspected when no other component seems faulty. You might see strange error codes. The machine could behave erratically. Sometimes, simply resetting the washing machine can clear a minor glitch. Unplug it for a few minutes. Then plug it back in. If the problem persists, the control board may be the culprit. Replacing a control board can be expensive. It also requires careful handling of electronic components. This is another situation where a professional diagnosis is often best. They can confirm the control board is the issue.

### Over-Sudsing

Excessive suds can also prevent your LG washing machine from spinning. Modern machines, especially HE (High-Efficiency) models, are sensitive to too much detergent. The machine detects the excess suds. It might extend the rinse cycle to remove them. If suds are extreme, the washer may stop the spin cycle completely. This protects the motor and prevents damage from an unbalanced, foamy load.

Always use HE detergent in an HE washing machine. Use the correct amount. More detergent does not mean cleaner clothes. In fact, it causes more problems. Refer to your detergent's instructions. Look for lines on the detergent dispenser. If you suspect over-sudsing, run an empty rinse cycle. Or run a "tub clean" cycle. This can help clear out detergent residue. Regular cleaning, including using proper HE detergents, is vital for your LG HE washing machine.

### Power Supply and Electrical Issues

A washing machine needs a stable power supply to function correctly. Power fluctuations or issues with the electrical outlet can disrupt cycles. If the machine does not get consistent power, it might halt mid-cycle. This can cause the rinse or spin cycle to fail. The machine might pause. It waits for stable power before continuing.

First, check the power cord. Make sure it is fully plugged into the outlet. Avoid using extension cords. They can cause voltage drops. Test the outlet itself. Plug in another appliance to see if it works. Check your home's circuit breaker. A tripped breaker will cut power to the washer. Reset the breaker if it is tripped. If power issues persist, an electrician may be needed. Ensure the electrical system delivers stable power to your machine. This helps all cycles complete correctly.

### Washer Not Level

A washing machine that is not level can also lead to spin cycle issues. LG washing machines have adjustable leveling feet. If one or more feet are uneven, the machine wobbles. This becomes more noticeable during the high-speed spin cycle. The machine's sensors detect this excessive vibration. To prevent damage or walking, the washer might stop the spin cycle. It may try to redistribute the load. If it cannot, it will not complete the spin.

Use a spirit level to check your washing machine's balance. Place it on top of the machine, front to back and side to side. Adjust the leveling feet until the bubble is centered. Most feet can be turned by hand or with a wrench. Ensure all four feet make firm contact with the floor. A stable machine spins more efficiently. It also reduces wear and tear on components.

### Error Codes and Diagnostics

LG washing machines often display error codes. These codes provide clues about the problem. When your machine fails to rinse or spin, look at the display. Write down any error code you see. These codes are specific. They point to a particular issue. For example, "OE" often means a drain error. "UE" indicates an unbalanced load.

Consult your LG washing machine's user manual. It contains a list of error codes and their meanings. The manual will also suggest troubleshooting steps for each code. If you do not have the physical manual, you can usually find it online on LG's support website. Understanding these codes helps you narrow down the problem quickly. It guides you to the correct fix. Many common issues have specific error codes that make diagnosis easier. For instance, sometimes your LG washing machine might get stuck on a certain time, like 7 minutes, and an error code could explain why.
