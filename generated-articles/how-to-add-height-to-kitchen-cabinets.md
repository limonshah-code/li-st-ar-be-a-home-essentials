## Elevate Your Kitchen: How To Add Height To Cabinets

Is your kitchen missing something? Perhaps you look at the space above your kitchen cabinets and see wasted potential. Adding height to kitchen cabinets transforms both the look and utility of your space. This project gives you more storage and makes your kitchen feel larger.

Many homeowners find their existing cabinets leave an awkward gap between the top and the ceiling. This space collects dust and offers no real purpose. By extending your cabinets upwards, you create a more custom, built-in appearance. You also gain valuable space for storing items you use less frequently. This guide explores popular methods to add height to kitchen cabinets. We will cover stacking new units, using filler strips, and decorative molding. We will also discuss essential planning steps and tool lists.

### Takeaway

Adding height to kitchen cabinets offers several benefits:

*   **Increases Storage**: Gain extra space for kitchen essentials, seasonal items, or display.
*   **Enhances Aesthetics**: Achieve a custom, built-in look that extends cabinets to the ceiling.
*   **Reduces Dust Traps**: Eliminate the awkward, hard-to-clean gap above cabinets.
*   **Boosts Home Value**: A refreshed kitchen with better storage can increase appeal.

### Clear Answer to the Main Query

You can add height to kitchen cabinets using several methods. These include stacking smaller cabinet units on top, installing filler strips with crown molding to bridge the gap, or building custom risers. Each method improves storage and upgrades your kitchen's overall aesthetic.

## Why Add Height to Kitchen Cabinets?

Many homeowners choose to extend their kitchen cabinets upwards for practical and aesthetic reasons. The space above standard cabinets often remains unused. It becomes a magnet for dust and clutter. Extending the cabinets makes good use of this empty area.

This upgrade significantly increases your kitchen's storage capacity. You can store seasonal dishes, seldom-used appliances, or extra pantry items. Visually, adding height creates a more cohesive look. It makes your kitchen feel taller and more complete.

### Maximizing Storage Space

The primary benefit of adding height to cabinets is the extra storage. We all know kitchen storage is valuable. Even a small increase in cabinet space can make a big difference. You can organize more items, reducing countertop clutter.

Consider using these new high spaces for things you do not need daily. Examples include special occasion dinnerware or large stock pots. This keeps everyday items more accessible. It also declutters lower shelves and drawers.

### Enhancing Kitchen Aesthetics

Beyond storage, the visual impact of extending your cabinets is significant. Tall cabinets draw the eye upward. This makes the ceiling appear higher. It gives the kitchen a grander feel. The look becomes more deliberate and custom-built.

Removing the gap above the cabinets also eliminates a visual break. This creates a continuous line from the countertop to the ceiling. It results in a sleek, polished appearance. Your kitchen will look more intentional and modern.

## Understanding Your Options for Cabinet Height Extension

Several methods exist for adding height to kitchen cabinets. Each approach has different skill levels and cost implications. Knowing your options helps you choose the best fit for your home. You can select a method that matches your budget and desired outcome.

Common ways to extend cabinets include stacking new units. Another popular choice involves adding filler strips and crown molding. Building custom risers also provides a unique solution. Consider the overall look you want to achieve. Think about the amount of storage you need.

### Stacking Cabinets Above Existing Units

Stacking involves placing smaller, shallower cabinets directly on top of your existing ones. These new cabinets typically match the style and finish of your current cabinetry. They provide functional storage space. This method creates a dramatic visual upgrade.

This approach requires careful measurement and secure installation. The new cabinets need proper support. They must also align perfectly with the lower units. This option often yields the most storage. It creates a very custom, high-end look.

### Using Filler Strips and Crown Molding

This method focuses more on aesthetics than pure storage. You bridge the gap between your cabinets and the ceiling using wood filler strips. Then, you cover these strips with decorative crown molding. The molding wraps around the top of your existing cabinets.

This creates the illusion of taller cabinets. It gives a finished, built-in appearance. While it does not add functional storage space within a cabinet box, it eliminates the dust-collecting gap. This method is often less expensive than stacking new units. It is also suitable for a DIY project.

### Building Custom Boxes or Risers

Custom boxes or risers offer a middle ground between storage and aesthetics. You build simple wooden boxes that sit on top of your existing cabinets. These boxes can be open for display or have custom doors added. They extend the cabinet line upwards.

This method gives you flexibility in design. You can choose to add open shelving for decor items. Alternatively, you can create closed storage for less attractive items. Building custom risers allows for unique design elements. You can match your existing kitchen style or introduce a new element.

## Method 1: Stacking Additional Cabinet Units

Stacking new cabinet units above your existing ones creates a truly custom look. This method also provides significant extra storage. It involves precise planning and careful execution. I find this approach makes a kitchen feel brand new.

This option works well if you have sufficient ceiling height. It suits kitchens with a more traditional or transitional style. The added height makes the room feel grander. It gives a full, built-in cabinetry appearance.

### Planning and Measurement for Stacking

Start by measuring the height from the top of your existing cabinets to the ceiling. This determines the maximum height for your new stacked units. Subtract some space for crown molding if you plan to use it. You need to account for slight ceiling variations. Ceilings are rarely perfectly level.

Measure the width and depth of your existing cabinets. Your new stacked units should match these dimensions. This ensures a seamless look. Decide if you want open shelving or closed cabinets. This choice impacts the cabinet style you purchase.

### Sourcing and Preparing New Cabinets

You can order custom cabinets or use stock cabinets. Stock cabinets might need modifications to fit perfectly. Choose cabinets that match your existing kitchen's style and color. This creates a cohesive design. If you cannot find an exact match, consider painting all cabinets a new, uniform color.

Before installation, prepare the new cabinets. Assemble them if they arrive flat-packed. Ensure all hardware is present. Inspect them for any damage. Having everything ready saves time during installation.

### Installation Steps for Stacked Units

1.  **Clear the Area**: Remove all items from your existing cabinets. This makes them lighter and safer to work with.
2.  **Level the Base**: Check the top of your existing cabinets for levelness. Use shims if necessary to create a flat base for the new units.
3.  **Attach Support Rails**: Install a ledger board or support rail on the wall above the existing cabinets. This provides a stable base.
4.  **Secure New Cabinets**: Lift the new upper cabinets into place. Clamp them together if installing multiple units. Secure them to the wall studs using screws. Drill pilot holes first to prevent splitting.
5.  **Connect Units**: Screw adjacent stacked cabinets together through their face frames. Use short, appropriate screws.
6.  **Install Doors and Hardware**: Attach the doors and install any new hardware. Adjust hinges for proper alignment.
7.  **Add Crown Molding**: Finish the top edge with crown molding. This hides gaps and provides a polished look.

Remember to work safely. Use a sturdy ladder or scaffolding. Having a helper is always a good idea for lifting. This project transforms your kitchen dramatically.

## Method 2: Using Filler Strips and Decorative Crown Molding

This method is ideal for those who want an aesthetic upgrade without adding storage space. It creates the illusion of taller cabinets. It also eliminates the awkward gap above your existing units. I often recommend this for a quick visual refresh.

This technique is generally less complex than stacking new cabinets. It involves basic carpentry skills. The impact on your kitchen's appearance is significant. It provides a clean, finished look.

### Preparing the Space and Materials

First, clear the top of your cabinets. Measure the height of the gap between your cabinets and the ceiling. This determines the width of your filler strips. You will use strips of wood to bridge this gap. These strips should be the same depth as your cabinet tops.

Choose wood that can be painted or stained to match your cabinets. You will also need crown molding. Select a style that complements your kitchen design. Gather your tools: a miter saw, nail gun, level, measuring tape, and caulk.

### Cutting and Attaching Filler Strips

Cut your wood filler strips to the correct height and length. Ensure they are straight and smooth. Attach these strips to the top of your existing cabinets and to the ceiling. Use construction adhesive for a strong bond. Also, use small finishing nails for added security.

Nail into the top of the cabinet frame where possible. When nailing into the ceiling, find ceiling joists if you can. If not, use appropriate anchors. Make sure the strips are plumb and level. This creates a solid base for the crown molding.

### Installing Crown Molding for a Finished Look

Crown molding adds elegance to the cabinet extension. It covers the seam where the filler strips meet the ceiling. It also creates a decorative edge. Measure and cut your crown molding pieces. You will need a miter saw to cut angles for corners.

Fit each piece of molding into place. Use a nail gun to secure it to the filler strips and the ceiling. Use small finishing nails. Apply caulk to fill any gaps between the molding and the ceiling or cabinets. This creates a seamless appearance. Finally, paint or stain the filler strips and molding to match your cabinets. This simple addition makes a huge difference.

## Method 3: Constructing Custom Risers or Open Shelving

Building custom risers offers flexibility in design and function. This method can add height while providing either open display space or closed storage. It lets you infuse a unique touch into your kitchen. I enjoy this option because it allows for creativity.

This approach suits various kitchen styles. It is especially good for contemporary or farmhouse designs. You decide the look and utility of the added height. This method requires some woodworking skills.

### Designing Your Custom Risers

Start by deciding if you want open shelves or enclosed boxes. Open shelves are perfect for displaying decorative items, cookbooks, or unique dishes. Enclosed boxes offer discrete storage. Measure the height you want to add. Also, measure the length and depth of your existing cabinets.

Sketch out your design. Consider the style of your current cabinets. You can match the wood and finish. Or, you can choose a contrasting material for a bold look. Think about how the risers will attach securely.

### Building and Finishing the Risers

Cut your wood pieces according to your design. Use plywood or solid wood. Assemble the boxes using wood glue and screws. Ensure all joints are strong and square. Sand the assembled risers thoroughly. This prepares them for painting or staining.

Match the paint or stain to your existing cabinets for a cohesive look. If choosing a contrasting material, apply your desired finish. Allow plenty of drying time. A good finish protects the wood and enhances its appearance.

### Attaching Custom Risers to Your Cabinets

Place the finished risers on top of your existing cabinets. Use a level to ensure they are perfectly straight. Secure the risers to the top of your existing cabinets. Use screws driven up from inside the cabinet below. Drill pilot holes first to prevent wood splitting.

For added stability, secure the risers to the wall studs where possible. Use long screws for this. If you opted for enclosed boxes, install cabinet doors and hardware. This final step completes your custom cabinet extension. These risers will add character and function to your kitchen.

## Planning Your Cabinet Height Project: Essential Steps

A successful cabinet height extension starts with solid planning. Proper preparation saves time and prevents mistakes. I always emphasize planning as the most important phase. This ensures your project goes smoothly.

Think about more than just the height. Consider how this change affects your entire kitchen. You need to ensure the new elements integrate well. This includes matching finishes and structural considerations.

### Accurate Measurements and Material Sourcing

Begin with precise measurements. Measure the full height from the top of your existing cabinets to the ceiling. Also, measure the length and depth of your cabinet run. Note any inconsistencies in ceiling height. These details influence your material needs.

Source your materials carefully. If stacking cabinets, order units that match your current style. If using filler strips and molding, select wood that takes paint or stain well. Consider buying a little extra material for cuts or mistakes. This avoids project delays.

### Budgeting and Matching Existing Finishes

Set a realistic budget for your project. Costs vary widely depending on the method and materials chosen. Stacking new cabinets is often the most expensive option. Filler strips and molding are usually more budget-friendly. Get quotes for materials and any professional help.

Matching your existing cabinet finish is crucial for a seamless look. Take a cabinet door or drawer front to a paint store for color matching. If staining, experiment with different stains on scrap wood first. Sometimes, painting all cabinets a new color is easier than matching an old one. This can also give your kitchen a complete facelift.

### Assessing Structural Support and Ceiling Conditions

Before adding weight, check the structural integrity of your existing cabinets. They must be securely fastened to the wall studs. Adding more weight means the base cabinets need to be strong. If you have any doubts, reinforce the mounting.

Inspect your ceiling. Is it plaster or drywall? Is it level? Large ceiling irregularities might require extra shimming or creative molding work. Ensure the ceiling can support any fasteners for the new extension. Planning includes checking for any existing electrical wires or plumbing that might be in the way. For broader kitchen upgrades, consider potential impacts on other areas, like if you're planning to [install a dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-install-a-dishwasher-in-my-kitchen). Such considerations ensure a comprehensive kitchen plan.

## DIY or Hire a Pro? Making the Right Choice for Your Kitchen

Deciding whether to DIY or hire a professional is a big part of project planning. Your skills, time, and budget play a role. I encourage DIY for those comfortable with tools. However, complex projects often benefit from expert hands.

Each approach has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Understanding these helps you make an informed decision. This choice impacts the quality, cost, and timeline of your cabinet height extension.

### Assessing Your Skill Level and Available Time

Evaluate your own woodworking and home improvement skills. Can you use a miter saw safely? Are you comfortable with measuring precisely and installing cabinets? If you are confident, a DIY approach can save money. However, if you lack experience, mistakes can be costly and frustrating.

Consider the time commitment. A DIY project takes longer than professional installation. Do you have free weekends and patience? If time is scarce, hiring a professional might be a better option. They complete work efficiently.

### Benefits of Professional Installation

Hiring a professional ensures high-quality results. Experienced installers possess the right tools and expertise. They handle complex cuts and ensure perfect alignment. Professionals can often source materials at better prices too. They complete the job quickly and correctly.

They also provide peace of mind. You avoid the stress and potential pitfalls of a DIY project. Professionals are insured, which protects you if issues arise. If your project involves significant structural changes or intricate molding, a pro is often worth the investment. This is especially true for projects that demand precision, similar to ensuring proper [dishwasher installation](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-install-a-dishwasher-in-my-kitchen) in a new kitchen layout.

### Cost Comparison and Project Complexity

DIY projects generally have lower labor costs. You pay only for materials. However, if you make errors, material waste can increase costs. You also might need to buy or rent specialized tools. These costs add up.

Professional installation includes labor fees. This makes the upfront cost higher. However, it often leads to a flawless finish. This avoids costly repairs later. For complex projects, such as integrating custom cabinetry or dealing with uneven ceilings, a professional is usually more cost-effective in the long run. They handle unforeseen challenges with ease.

## Tools and Materials You Will Need for the Project

Having the right tools and materials makes any home improvement project smoother. Gathering everything before you start saves trips to the hardware store. I always make a checklist. This ensures I have every item required.

## Ensuring Structural Integrity and a Flawless Finish

Adding height to cabinets requires attention to both stability and appearance. The new sections must be securely installed. The finish needs to be seamless. I focus on these two aspects for a truly professional result.

A structurally sound installation guarantees safety and longevity. A flawless finish ensures your kitchen looks complete and beautiful. Both elements are equally important for a successful project.

### Secure Mounting and Leveling

Structural integrity begins with proper mounting. Ensure your existing cabinets are firmly anchored to wall studs. Use long, strong screws for this. When adding new units or risers, secure them directly to wall studs whenever possible. This prevents sagging or instability.

Use a level at every step of the installation. Cabinets, filler strips, and molding must be plumb and level. Even slight discrepancies become noticeable. Use shims to correct any unevenness between existing cabinets and the new additions. Proper leveling makes doors hang straight and ensures a professional look.

### Seamless Integration and Finishing Touches

Achieving a flawless finish means making the new sections blend with the old. This involves careful painting or staining. Match the color and sheen as closely as possible. If matching is difficult, consider repainting all cabinets for a uniform look.

Caulk fills any small gaps between wood pieces or where molding meets the ceiling. This creates smooth, clean lines. After caulking, paint over it for an invisible finish. This attention to detail makes your cabinet extension look like it was always part of your kitchen. It completes the transformation.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: How much height can I add to my kitchen cabinets?

The amount of height you can add depends on your ceiling height and the style of your existing cabinets. Most commonly, people add between 12 to 24 inches. This bridges the gap to a standard 8-foot ceiling. Always leave a small clearance for crown molding or slight ceiling variations.
