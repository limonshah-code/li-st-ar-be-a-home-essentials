## Elevate Your Kitchen: Adding Height to Cabinets

Do you look at the space above your kitchen cabinets and see wasted potential? Many homes have a gap between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling. This unused area collects dust and offers no benefit. I found myself in this exact situation, dreaming of more storage and a grander look for my kitchen. Learning how to add height to kitchen cabinets transformed my space.

Extending cabinet height brings many advantages. You gain valuable storage, making your kitchen more organized. It also creates a custom, built-in appearance, giving your kitchen a high-end feel. This guide explains several practical ways to add height, from simple fixes to more involved projects. We will cover utilizing risers, stacking modules, and adding decorative elements like crown molding. My goal is to help you achieve a functional and beautiful kitchen.

### Takeaway

*   **Assess your kitchen's needs:** Determine if you need more storage, a better look, or both.
*   **Choose a method:** Select between cabinet risers, stacked modules, or decorative molding.
*   **Measure accurately:** Precision ensures a seamless and professional result.
*   **Gather tools and materials:** Have everything ready before you start your project.
*   **Prioritize safety:** Always use appropriate protective gear and follow safety guidelines.
*   **Finish with care:** Matching finishes ensure the new height integrates with existing cabinets.

To add height to kitchen cabinets, you can use risers, stacked cabinet modules, or decorative crown molding and fascia. Each method offers a different level of complexity and aesthetic outcome, providing increased storage, a custom appearance, and a more finished look for your kitchen.

### Understanding Why You Need More Cabinet Height

The space above kitchen cabinets often remains empty. This creates a visual break in your kitchen's design. It also means you are not using valuable vertical space. Many homeowners want to add height to kitchen cabinets to solve these common problems. I certainly did when I first looked at my own kitchen.

Adding height offers clear benefits. First, it boosts your storage capacity significantly. You can store seldom-used items, seasonal decor, or extra pantry supplies. This frees up lower cabinets for daily essentials. Imagine a less cluttered countertop and more organized cupboards.

Second, extending the height creates a more cohesive look. It makes your cabinets appear built-in, reaching the ceiling. This gives your kitchen a custom and polished feel. The small gap can make a kitchen look unfinished. Filling it visually connects the cabinets to the ceiling. This helps your kitchen look grander and more substantial.

Finally, it can update an outdated kitchen. Older kitchens often have shorter cabinets. Adding height instantly modernizes the space. It can transform the entire feel of your room without a full renovation. My kitchen felt completely new after this simple change.

### Method 1: Utilizing Cabinet Risers and Feet

Cabinet risers offer a straightforward way to add height to kitchen cabinets. This method works well if you want a subtle lift. It is also good if you need to adjust cabinet height for functional reasons. I considered this for my own base cabinets before deciding on wall cabinet extensions.

Risers are typically blocks or feet placed under base cabinets. They can increase the height by a few inches. This is useful for making countertops taller. Taller countertops can be more comfortable for tall individuals. They can also create a more ergonomic workspace. Risers come in various materials, including wood and plastic.

To install risers, you lift the cabinet slightly. Then you slide the risers into place. You must ensure the cabinet remains level and stable. Securing them firmly prevents wobbling. This method is often less labor-intensive than others. It also involves less structural change.

While primarily for base cabinets, the concept of adding a small, discreet extension can apply to wall cabinets too. You might add a small block or decorative foot to the very top. This raises the cabinet slightly from its mounting point. Then, you can add crown molding above it to bridge the remaining gap. This creates a more finished look. It is a quick solution for slight height needs.

### Method 2: Stacking Cabinets or Building Box Extensions

For a significant increase in height, stacking cabinets is an excellent solution. This method involves placing smaller cabinet units on top of your existing ones. It creates a truly custom, built-in look. I chose this approach for my upper cabinets and the results were dramatic.

You can buy small, open-shelf cabinets or short, enclosed units designed for stacking. These are often called "stacking cabinets" or "uppers." They match your existing cabinet style and finish. If you cannot find an exact match, you can paint them to match your current cabinets. You can learn how to change the color of kitchen cabinets to blend these new additions seamlessly.

Alternatively, you can build custom box extensions. This is a good option if you have basic carpentry skills. You construct simple wooden frames or boxes that sit on top of your existing cabinets. These boxes can be open for display or have doors for enclosed storage. You can then finish them to match your current kitchen. Building allows for exact size and style matches.

Secure the stacked cabinets or extensions firmly to the existing cabinets and the wall studs. Use screws appropriate for wood. Make sure they go through the cabinet frames into solid support. This ensures stability and safety. If you are building a new pantry, you might want to learn how to stack wall cabinets to make a pantry. This can help with the structural considerations of stacking. Remember, proper installation is key for longevity.

### Method 3: Adding Crown Molding and Fascia to Bridge Gaps

Adding crown molding and fascia is a popular way to add height to kitchen cabinets. This method focuses on aesthetics rather than direct storage. It effectively bridges the gap between your cabinets and the ceiling. This gives your kitchen a truly finished and elegant appearance. I used this method to complete my kitchen's refined look.

Fascia is a flat trim piece installed vertically on top of the cabinet. It extends upwards, closing part of the gap. This provides a surface for attaching crown molding. You cut the fascia to fit the length of your cabinets. Then you secure it firmly to the top of the existing cabinet frames.

Crown molding is a decorative trim piece with a curved profile. It installs at an angle, connecting the top of the fascia to the ceiling. The molding creates a sophisticated transition. It draws the eye upward, making the kitchen feel taller. You cut crown molding with mitered corners for a clean, seamless joint.

This method requires precise measurements and cuts. It also requires careful installation to achieve a professional look. You might need to use fillers or shims to ensure the fascia is plumb. This ensures the crown molding sits correctly. You can often match new trim pieces to existing cabinet materials. You can also paint them to blend perfectly. Adding trim is a good way to finish the look. Consider how to add trim to bottom of kitchen cabinets to understand the principles of trim installation. This gives a uniform design throughout.

### Choosing the Right Materials and Tools for Your Project

Selecting the correct materials and having the right tools is important for any cabinet height extension project. The materials you choose will depend on your chosen method. They also depend on your existing cabinet style. I made sure to gather everything before I started my project.

For stacked cabinets or box extensions, you need wood or plywood. Match the wood type and finish as closely as possible to your existing cabinets. Common choices include maple, oak, or MDF. If you plan to paint, MDF or paint-grade wood works well. You also need wood screws, wood glue, and caulk. These materials help secure joints and create a smooth finish.

For crown molding and fascia, you will need similar wood products. Molding comes in various profiles and sizes. Choose a profile that complements your kitchen's design. Make sure the wood type is suitable for painting or staining. You will also need finishing nails or a nail gun. These secure the trim pieces.

Essential tools include:
*   **Measuring tape:** For accurate dimensions.
*   **Pencil:** For marking cuts and placement.
*   **Level:** To ensure everything is straight and plumb.
*   **Stud finder:** To locate wall studs for secure attachment.
*   **Drill:** For pre-drilling holes and driving screws.
*   **Saw:** A miter saw is ideal for precise angle cuts on trim and wood. A circular saw works for straight cuts on larger panels.
*   **Sanding supplies:** For smoothing surfaces before finishing.
*   **Safety gear:** Safety glasses, gloves, and a dust mask protect you during the work.

Having all your materials and tools ready saves time. It also ensures the project runs smoothly. This preparation prevents interruptions. It leads to a better finished product.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Extending Kitchen Cabinet Height

Extending kitchen cabinet height involves careful planning and execution. This step-by-step guide walks you through the process. It assumes you have chosen a method and gathered your materials. I followed a similar process for my own kitchen project.

**Step 1: Clear and Prepare the Area.**
Remove everything from inside and on top of the cabinets. Cover countertops and flooring to protect them from dust and debris. Turn off power to any outlets or lights near your work area. This ensures your workspace is safe and clear.

**Step 2: Take Precise Measurements.**
Measure the exact distance from the top of your current cabinets to the ceiling. Also, measure the width and depth of your cabinets. These measurements guide your material purchases or cuts. Accuracy is important for a seamless fit.

**Step 3: Disconnect and Detach (if necessary).**
For stacking new cabinets or building extensions, you might need to temporarily remove existing cabinets. Disconnect any plumbing or electrical lines if they pass through cabinets. Carefully unscrew cabinets from walls and adjacent units. Have help to lift and move them safely.

**Step 4: Install New Structure (depending on method).**
*   **For stacked cabinets:** Place the new smaller cabinets on top of the existing ones. Align them perfectly. Screw them together from the inside using short wood screws. Secure the stacked units to wall studs using appropriate screws and anchors. Remember to maintain level and plumb. You might find similar techniques in guides on how to make a kitchen island out of base cabinets.
*   **For custom box extensions:** Build your boxes according to your measurements. Attach them to the top of your existing cabinets using screws and wood glue. Then, secure them to the wall studs.
*   **For fascia and crown molding:** Install the fascia boards vertically on top of the existing cabinet frames. Use finishing nails. Then, cut and install the crown molding at the top of the fascia. Ensure all angles are cut accurately for tight joints.

**Step 5: Finish and Blend.**
This is where your new height integrates with the old. Fill any screw holes or gaps with wood filler. Sand all surfaces smooth. Apply primer, then paint or stain to match your existing cabinets. You might learn how to paint kitchen cabinets without sanding if you plan on painting. This makes the new additions disappear visually. You can also explore options to change the color of kitchen cabinets if you want a fresh new look for the entire set.

**Step 6: Reinstall and Cleanup.**
Reattach any removed cabinets. Reconnect plumbing and electrical lines. Clean up all dust and debris. Step back and admire your newly elevated cabinets!

### Design Considerations: Blending New Height with Existing Cabinets

After you add height to kitchen cabinets, the next step is to ensure the new parts blend seamlessly. This makes your kitchen look like it was always designed that way. Achieving a cohesive look requires careful attention to detail. I spent time ensuring my added height looked like it belonged.

**Matching Materials and Finishes:**
The most important aspect is matching the new material to the old. If your existing cabinets are wood, try to find the same wood species for new extensions. For painted cabinets, matching the paint color is crucial. Get a paint sample or color match done professionally. Remember that older paint may have faded or yellowed. This means a direct match to new paint might stand out. Consider painting all cabinets if a perfect match is hard. You can explore how to change the colour of kitchen cabinets for a fresh unified appearance.

**Hardware and Style Consistency:**
Ensure any new doors or pulls on stacked cabinets match the existing ones. This includes hinges, knobs, and handles. Maintaining consistent hardware style prevents a patchwork look. If you are not adding new doors, ensure the trim work matches. Even how you install a shelf can impact the overall feel. For instance, knowing how to install a shelf between two cabinets can inform how you add internal shelving in your new upper sections.

**Crown Molding and Trim:**
If you used crown molding, ensure its profile complements existing trim in your home. It should not look out of place. Consider how it meets the ceiling and any adjacent walls. Proper finishing of these trim pieces helps integrate the new height.

**Lighting Integration:**
Think about adding lighting. Recessed lighting in the top of the added section can highlight the ceiling. Under-cabinet lighting can also be extended to the new height for more ambient light. This enhances the visual appeal.

**Overall Kitchen Harmony:**
Step back and view your kitchen as a whole. Does the added height feel balanced? Does it improve the overall flow and aesthetics? Sometimes, small adjustments to decor or paint in other areas can help tie everything together. The goal is an intentional, unified design.
