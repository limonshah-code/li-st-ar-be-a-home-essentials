Understanding this symbol helps you diagnose the problem. It empowers you to take the correct steps for resolution. Different Miele models might show slightly different versions of the cross, but the meaning remains consistent: something requires attention.

The red cross is distinct from other Miele indicators. For instance, a faucet symbol means a water intake problem. A drainage symbol means a drainage issue. The red cross is a broader warning. It appears when the machine detects a critical fault. This fault prevents normal operation. It often indicates that the machine cannot proceed with the wash cycle. You must address the underlying cause to clear the error. This ensures your appliance runs safely and efficiently.

Miele machines are known for their durability. However, like all appliances, they can experience issues. The red cross serves as an early warning system. It protects the machine from damage. It also alerts you to potential problems. For example, a blocked filter can cause this error. If you do not clear the filter, it can strain the pump. This can lead to more costly repairs. Always pay attention to this warning. Prompt action helps maintain your Miele washing machine's longevity.

## Common Reasons for the Red Cross Error on Your Miele

Many issues can cause the red cross symbol to appear on your Miele washing machine. Identifying the exact cause is the first step in troubleshooting. Often, the problem is simple to fix. Let us explore the most common culprits behind this warning.

### Blocked Filters

One frequent cause of the red cross is a blocked filter. Your Miele washing machine has several filters. The most common one to cause issues is the drain filter. This filter collects lint, debris, and small objects. If it becomes clogged, water cannot drain properly. The machine detects this blockage. It then displays the red cross symbol.

You might also have a blocked water inlet filter. These filters are at the end of the water supply hoses. They prevent sediment from entering the machine. If these filters clog, the machine cannot fill with enough water. This also triggers the red cross error. Regularly cleaning these filters prevents many problems.

### Drainage Issues

Problems with drainage often trigger the red cross. This goes beyond just a blocked filter. The drain hose itself might be kinked. It could be bent or twisted behind the machine. This restricts water flow. Alternatively, the drain hose might have a blockage. Foreign objects can get stuck inside. These issues stop the machine from emptying water. Your Miele washing machine detects this failure. It then shows the red cross warning.

The drain pump could also be faulty. The pump pushes water out of the machine. If it malfunctions, water stays in the drum. This prevents the cycle from ending. A struggling or broken pump will cause a red cross error. You might also notice your Miele washing machine leaking from the bottom. This can be a sign of a drainage problem. For more information on leaks, refer to our guide on [why is my Miele washing machine leaking from the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-miele-washing-machine-leaking-from-the-bottom).

### Water Intake Problems

Insufficient water supply is another common reason for the red cross. Your Miele machine needs enough water to operate. Check if the water taps are fully open. Ensure the cold and hot water hoses are not kinked or blocked. Low water pressure in your home can also cause this issue. The machine will try to fill but cannot reach the required level. This triggers the error.

Sometimes, the water inlet valve itself might be faulty. This valve controls water entry into the machine. If it fails, water cannot get in. The red cross will appear. If your Miele washing machine is not filling with water, it could be the cause of the red cross. We have a detailed article on [why is my Miele washing machine not filling with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-miele-washing-machine-not-filling-with-water) that can provide further assistance.

### Door Lock Faults

A Miele washing machine must have its door securely closed and locked to start a cycle. If the door latch or lock mechanism is faulty, the machine will not begin. It will display the red cross. This is a safety feature. It prevents water from escaping during operation. Sometimes, simply closing the door firmly can resolve this. However, if the lock is broken, it needs repair.

If your Miele washing machine door is not opening or not unlocking, it will definitely cause issues. Learn more about fixing this problem in our article on [why is my Miele washing machine not opening the door](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-miele-washing-machine-not-opening-the-door). An article on [why is my Miele washing machine door not unlocking](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-miele-washing-machine-door-not-unlocking) provides even more specific steps.

### Overdosing Detergent

Using too much detergent can lead to excessive suds. This might surprise you, but it can cause the red cross error. Too many suds confuse the machine's sensors. The sensors may detect a blockage or an issue with water levels. The machine then halts the cycle and displays the warning. Miele machines are efficient. They often require less detergent than other brands. Always follow detergent manufacturer instructions and Miele's recommendations. For more on detergent use, see our guide on [can I use any detergent with Miele washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-any-detergent-with-miele-washing-machine).

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting for Miele Red Cross Errors

When the red cross lights up on your Miele washing machine, do not panic. Many issues are simple to fix. Follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem effectively. You can often resolve the error without professional help.

### Initial Checks and Power Cycle

Start with the easiest solutions. First, check your Miele washing machine's power supply. Ensure it is plugged in correctly. Sometimes, a loose connection causes errors. You can also try a power cycle. Turn off the machine at the power outlet. Wait for about 10-15 minutes. Then, plug it back in and turn it on. This can reset the machine's internal system. It clears temporary glitches. This is a good first step for many appliance issues. If your Miele washing machine has no power at all, you will need to address that first. Our article [why does my Miele washing machine have no power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-miele-washing-machine-have-no-power) offers solutions for this specific problem.

Next, ensure the washing machine door is closed securely. Push it firmly until you hear a click. The machine will not start if the door is not fully latched. This is a common oversight. Also, check that no laundry items are caught in the door seal. This can prevent a proper seal.

### Focus on Drain Filter Cleaning

The drain filter is a common culprit for the red cross. It is usually located at the bottom front of your Miele washing machine.
1.  **Locate the drain filter:** It is behind a small access panel.
2.  **Prepare for water:** Place a shallow tray and towels under the filter area. Water will escape when you open the filter.
3.  **Open the filter cover:** Twist the cap counter-clockwise to open it.
4.  **Remove debris:** Carefully pull out the filter. Remove any lint, coins, buttons, or other foreign objects.
5.  **Clean the filter:** Rinse the filter under running water. Use a soft brush if needed.
6.  **Check the housing:** Look inside the filter housing. Ensure no blockages remain. You might find more debris inside.
7.  **Reinsert and close:** Push the filter back in firmly. Twist clockwise to secure the cap. Close the access panel.

After cleaning the filter, run a short rinse and spin cycle. This tests if the drainage issue is resolved. The red cross should disappear.

### Checking Water Supply Hoses

Issues with water supply can also trigger the red cross.
1.  **Check the taps:** Make sure the hot and cold water supply taps are fully open. They are usually behind the machine.
2.  **Inspect hoses for kinks:** Look at the water inlet hoses. Ensure they are not bent, twisted, or kinked. Straighten any kinks you find.
3.  **Check inlet filters:** At the end of each water inlet hose, where it connects to the machine, there are small filters. Unscrew the hoses. Pull out these small mesh filters. Clean them under running water. Reinsert and reattach the hoses securely.
4.  **Test water pressure:** If water flow is weak, your home's water pressure might be low. This is less common but can cause problems.
If your machine is having trouble filling, it is a good idea to check our guide on [why is my Miele washing machine not filling with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-miele-washing machine-not-filling-with-water) for more detailed troubleshooting steps.

### Inspecting the Drain Hose

The drain hose removes dirty water from your Miele washing machine.
1.  **Check for kinks:** Follow the drain hose from the back of the machine to your drain pipe. Ensure there are no sharp bends or kinks.
2.  **Check for blockages:** If possible, disconnect the drain hose from the standpipe (where it drains into the plumbing). Look inside for any obstructions. You might need a flashlight.
3.  **Proper height:** Ensure the drain hose is installed at the correct height. It should not be too low or too high. Refer to your Miele washing machine manual for the ideal height. Improper height can cause drainage problems or siphoning issues.

By systematically going through these troubleshooting steps, you can often pinpoint and resolve the reason for the red cross on your Miele washing machine.

## Addressing Water Intake and Drainage Problems

Water intake and drainage issues are very common causes for the red cross symbol on Miele washing machines. Proper water flow in and out of the machine is essential for every wash cycle. If these systems fail, the machine will stop and show an error. Let us delve deeper into how to fix these specific problems.

### Cleaning Inlet Filters

Your Miele washing machine has small mesh filters at the water inlet points. These are located where the water supply hoses connect to the back of the machine. Over time, sediment and debris from your water supply can collect in these filters. This restricts water flow. Reduced water flow means the machine cannot fill correctly. This triggers the red cross error.

To clean these filters, first, turn off the water supply taps. Then, carefully unscrew the hot and cold water hoses from the back of the Miele washing machine. You will see small mesh filters inside the connection points on the machine itself. Use a pair of pliers or tweezers to gently pull out these filters. Rinse them thoroughly under running water until all debris is gone. Replace the filters and reattach the hoses securely. Make sure the connections are tight to prevent leaks. Then, turn the water supply back on. Run a short cycle to check if the issue is resolved.

### Checking Water Pressure

Low water pressure in your home can also lead to the red cross error. The Miele washing machine needs a certain level of water pressure to fill efficiently. If the pressure is too low, the machine will time out. It will display the error. To check your home's water pressure, you can use a pressure gauge. These are available at most hardware stores. Attach it to an outdoor spigot or a utility sink faucet. The ideal water pressure for most homes is between 40 and 60 PSI.

If your water pressure is consistently low, you might need to consult a plumber. They can diagnose and fix overall plumbing issues. Sometimes, low pressure affects only specific faucets or appliances. Ensure that all household water fixtures are performing normally. This helps rule out a localized problem.

### Unclogging the Drain Pump

The drain pump removes water from the drum after each cycle. If the pump is clogged, water cannot exit. This leads to standing water in the drum. It also triggers the red cross symbol. The drain pump on Miele washing machines often has a small impeller. This impeller can get blocked by small items like coins, hairpins, or lint.

To access the drain pump, you usually need to open the drain filter access panel at the bottom front of the machine. After removing the drain filter (as described earlier), you might see the pump impeller. Use a flashlight to inspect it. Carefully remove any objects that are blocking the impeller. Turn the impeller by hand to ensure it spins freely. Be cautious, as there might be residual water. Once clear, reassemble the filter and cover.

### Checking the Drain Hose for Blockages

The drain hose carries water from the Miele washing machine to your home's drainage system. This hose can develop kinks or blockages. A kinked hose restricts water flow. A blockage can stop it completely. Both scenarios will cause the red cross.

Inspect the entire length of the drain hose. Ensure it is not bent sharply behind the machine. Make sure it is not pressed against a wall. If it connects to a standpipe, check that the hose is not pushed too far down. This can create a siphon effect. It can also cause drainage issues. If you suspect an internal blockage, you may need to disconnect the hose. Carefully inspect it for debris. You might need to use a snake or flush water through it to clear any clogs. Ensuring a clear, unkinked drain hose is vital for proper machine operation.

## When the Red Cross Points to a Door Lock or Sensor Fault

The Miele washing machine's door lock mechanism is a critical safety feature. It ensures the door remains sealed during operation. If the red cross appears, sometimes the issue lies with this component. The machine needs to detect that the door is closed and securely locked before it can start.

### How Door Lock Issues Manifest

A faulty door lock can cause the red cross symbol in several ways. The machine might simply refuse to start a cycle. You may press the start button, but nothing happens. The red cross stays lit. This means the machine's sensors do not register the door as closed. Or they detect a problem with the lock itself. Sometimes, the door might seem closed, but the internal locking pin does not engage.

You might also find that the door will not open after a cycle or even during one. This is frustrating. If your [Miele washing machine door is not unlocking](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-miele-washing-machine-door-not-unlocking), it directly points to a door lock issue. The red cross can be a direct symptom of this problem. This safety interlock prevents flooding. It also keeps you from opening the door when the drum is full of water or spinning at high speeds.

### Safety Features and Red Cross

Miele washing machines have robust safety features. The door lock is a primary one. If the machine detects any malfunction with this lock, it will not operate. It displays the red cross to alert you. This prevents potential water leaks or injuries from a spinning drum. The red cross tells you that the machine's safety system is active. It prevents operation because a condition for safe use is not met.

The internal sensors in the door lock assembly communicate with the main control board. If these sensors fail or give incorrect readings, the control board will assume the door is not secure. This triggers the red cross error. It ensures the machine remains in a safe, non-operational state until the issue is resolved.

### Simple Resets vs. Professional Help

Before calling a technician, try a few simple resets for door lock issues.
1.  **Firmly close the door:** Sometimes, the door is not pushed closed enough. Give it a firm push until you hear a click.
2.  **Check for obstructions:** Ensure no clothing or foreign objects are caught between the door and the rubber gasket. Even a small sock can prevent a proper seal.
3.  **Power cycle:** Unplug the machine from the power outlet for about 10-15 minutes. This can reset the electronic components. Sometimes, it clears minor glitches in the door lock sensor. Plug it back in and try to start a cycle.

If these steps do not work, the door lock assembly itself might be faulty. A broken latch, a worn-out solenoid, or a damaged sensor within the lock can be the cause. These components often require replacement. Replacing a door lock assembly typically requires disassembling parts of the machine. This is a more complex repair. It often needs specialized tools. In such cases, it is best to consult a Miele service technician. Attempting repairs beyond your skill level can cause further damage or void your warranty.

## Preventing Future Red Cross Errors: Miele Maintenance Tips

Proactive maintenance is key to keeping your Miele washing machine running smoothly. Regular care helps prevent common issues that trigger the red cross error. Following a simple maintenance routine extends your machine's lifespan. It also ensures efficient washing performance.

### Regular Filter Cleaning

The drain filter and water inlet filters are crucial components. They prevent debris from entering or exiting the machine incorrectly.
*   **Drain Filter:** Clean the drain filter every few months, or more often if you wash items with a lot of lint (e.g., pet blankets). You will find it at the bottom front of your Miele washing machine. Place a shallow tray and towels underneath before opening. Remove any lint, coins, or small items. Rinse the filter under running water. This simple step prevents drainage problems.
*   **Water Inlet Filters:** Check the small mesh filters on the water inlet hoses annually. Turn off the water supply first. Disconnect the hoses from the back of the machine. Pull out the filters and rinse them clean. These filters prevent sediment from reaching internal components. Keeping them clean ensures proper water fill.

### Proper Detergent Use

Using the correct amount and type of detergent is vital for your Miele washing machine.
*   **Amount:** Miele washing machines are highly efficient. They often require less detergent than you might be used to. Too much detergent creates excessive suds. These suds can interfere with the machine's sensors. This can lead to error codes, including the red cross. Always follow the dosage recommendations on your detergent packaging. Also, check your Miele washing machine manual for specific guidelines.
*   **Type:** Use high-efficiency (HE) detergent formulated for modern washing machines. These detergents produce fewer suds. They clean effectively with less product.
