Pairing them with a high-quality rugged case maximizes their protective capabilities for any adventure.

## Understanding iPhone Durability Ratings and Features

When you look for a rugged iPhone, understanding its built-in durability is a good first step. Apple designs iPhones with specific resistance levels. These levels are measured by standard ratings and involve special materials. We will break down what these ratings and materials mean for your phone’s safety in outdoor settings.

### Ingress Protection (IP) Rating Explained

Every modern iPhone carries an Ingress Protection (IP) rating. This rating tells you how well the device resists dust and water. The current standard for recent iPhones is IP68. The first digit, '6,' means the phone is completely dust-tight. No harmful dust can enter the device. This is crucial when you are out on dusty trails or sandy beaches.

The second digit, '8,' indicates water resistance. It means the iPhone can withstand submersion in water up to 6 meters (about 19.7 feet) for up to 30 minutes. This rating is good for accidental drops in puddles or light rain. It does not mean the phone is fully waterproof for all conditions. Remember, warranty claims often do not cover liquid damage. Proper understanding of this rating helps you avoid misuse. For example, you should avoid prolonged submersion or exposure to high-pressure water. If you need to make something more resilient to water, consider how to waterproof a table for outdoor use, applying similar principles of protection.
