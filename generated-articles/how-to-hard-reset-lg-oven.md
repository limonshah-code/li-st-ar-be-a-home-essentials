It allows the internal computer to reboot cleanly. Do not rush this process. Take your time to ensure everything is done correctly.

### Step 1: Disconnect the Power Supply

This is the most critical step. You must completely cut power to the oven. There are two primary ways to do this.

#### Option A: Unplugging the Oven

If your LG oven is a freestanding model, you can usually unplug it.
1.  **Locate the Power Cord:** The power cord is typically at the back of the oven.
2.  **Pull the Oven Out:** Gently pull the oven away from the wall. This gives you access to the cord. Be careful not to scratch your floor or damage the power cord.
3.  **Unplug:** Firmly grasp the plug itself, not the cord. Pull it straight out from the wall outlet. Do not yank the cord. Make sure it is completely disconnected.

#### Option B: Turning Off the Circuit Breaker

For built-in ovens or if you cannot reach the plug, use the circuit breaker.
1.  **Find Your Electrical Panel:** This is usually in your basement, garage, or a utility closet.
2.  **Locate the Oven Breaker:** Look for a clearly labeled breaker. It might say "Oven," "Range," or list the kitchen area. If unsure, you can turn off the main breaker for your entire home. This is a safe alternative.
3.  **Flip the Breaker:** Switch the breaker to the "OFF" position. It should click firmly into place. Double-check that the oven display is completely dark. This confirms power is off.

### Step 2: Wait for 5-10 Minutes

Once power is off, wait. This waiting period is crucial. It allows the oven's internal capacitors to discharge fully. It ensures that all temporary memory is cleared. A shorter wait might not fully clear the system. I usually set a timer for 10 minutes. This gives me peace of mind. During this time, you might hear a faint click or hum as power dissipates. This is normal.

### Step 3: Restore Power

After the waiting period, reconnect power to the oven.

#### If You Unplugged the Oven:
1.  **Plug It Back In:** Carefully push the power plug back into the wall outlet. Ensure it is fully seated.
2.  **Push Oven Back:** Gently slide the oven back into its position against the wall. Be careful not to pinch the cord.

#### If You Used the Circuit Breaker:
1.  **Flip the Breaker On:** Go back to your electrical panel. Switch the oven's circuit breaker back to the "ON" position. You should hear a click.
2.  **Check Oven Display:** The oven display should light up. It might show the clock or a default setting.

### Step 4: Test the Oven

Now, test your LG oven.
1.  **Set the Clock:** If needed, set the current time. This confirms the oven has power.
2.  **Run a Test Cycle:** Try to preheat the oven. Set it to a common temperature, like 350°F (175°C). Observe if it heats correctly. Check if the error code is gone. Test various functions, such as the oven light or convection fan. A successful hard reset means your oven should now work properly.

Remember, if the problem persists after a hard reset, the issue might be more serious. This could indicate a faulty component. In such cases, contact LG customer support or a certified appliance technician. You might also find similar troubleshooting steps useful for other LG appliances, such as learning how to reset your LG washing machine.

It helped me understand what the F1 code meant for a temperature sensor. Always keep your user manual handy. If you no longer have it, you can usually find a digital copy on the LG support website.

### Inspect the Power Cord and Outlet

Even if the oven powers on, a faulty power connection can cause issues.
1.  **Examine the Cord:** Look for any visible damage. Check for fraying, cuts, or scorch marks. A damaged cord is a fire hazard. Replace it immediately if damaged.
2.  **Check the Outlet:** Ensure the outlet itself works. You can test it with another appliance, like a hair dryer. Make sure the outlet provides proper voltage. A loose connection in the outlet can cause intermittent problems.

### Verify Temperature Sensor (Probe)

The oven's temperature sensor tells the control board the internal temperature. If this sensor is faulty, the oven will not heat correctly.
1.  **Locate the Sensor:** The sensor is usually a small metal rod inside the oven cavity. It often protrudes from the back or side wall.
2.  **Inspect for Damage:** Look for visible signs of damage. Sometimes, food spills can corrode it.
3.  **Check Connection:** Ensure the sensor is firmly plugged into its receptacle. A loose connection can cause false readings. Replacing a temperature sensor is often a straightforward DIY task. However, make sure you get the correct part number from your manual.

### Examine Door Switch and Latch

The oven door has safety switches. These switches ensure the oven only operates when the door is closed. They also control the self-clean cycle.
1.  **Inspect the Latch:** Check if the door latch moves freely. Ensure it fully engages when the door closes.
2.  **Listen for Clicks:** When you close the door, you should hear the switches click into place. If not, a switch might be stuck or broken.
3.  **Check for Obstructions:** Make sure no debris or food particles block the latch mechanism. Sometimes, crumbs can prevent proper door closure.

### Resetting Specific LG Oven Features

Some LG ovens have specific reset procedures for individual features.
*   **Clock Reset:** After any power outage, the clock usually defaults to 12:00. This is normal. Simply reset the time.
*   **Calibration:** If your oven heats but the temperature is off, it might need calibration. Your user manual will provide steps for this. It usually involves adjusting a setting in the control panel menu. I once had to calibrate my oven when it was always 25 degrees cooler than set. The manual showed me how to adjust it. This helps fine-tune the temperature accuracy.
*   **Child Lock:** If the oven controls are locked, look for a "Lock" or "Control Lock" button. Hold it for a few seconds to deactivate it. This is not a hard reset, but a common source of confusion.

If these steps do not solve your problem, the issue might be a faulty control board, heating element, or fan motor. These require professional service. Do not attempt complex electrical repairs yourself unless you are qualified. You could accidentally cause more damage or create a safety hazard.
