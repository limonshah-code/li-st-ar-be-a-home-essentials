## Troubleshooting: Why Does Ring Doorbell Keep Disconnecting?

It can be frustrating when your smart home device does not work as expected. Your Ring Doorbell provides security and convenience, but a disconnecting device stops this help. Many homeowners find their Ring Doorbell keeps disconnecting from their home network. This problem prevents motion alerts and live view. It leaves your home vulnerable and causes worry.

I understand how vital a reliable security system is for your peace of mind. A constantly disconnecting Ring Doorbell means missed visitors or security breaches. This guide explores the main reasons why your Ring Doorbell loses connection. We will cover everything from Wi-Fi signal strength to power issues and device settings. My goal is to help you fix these frustrating disconnections. You can get your Ring Doorbell working properly again.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Wi-Fi Signal:** Ensure strong signal strength (RSSI) for stable connection.
*   **Address Power Issues:** Confirm sufficient power from battery or wired transformer.
*   **Reduce Network Interference:** Optimize Wi-Fi channels and device placement.
*   **Update Software:** Keep your Ring app and device firmware current.
*   **Reset and Reconnect:** Use factory reset as a last resort for persistent problems.

Your Ring Doorbell keeps disconnecting typically due to poor Wi-Fi signal, insufficient power, or network interference. Solving these issues often involves checking your device's signal strength (RSSI), ensuring proper power supply, and optimizing your home's Wi-Fi network to maintain a stable connection.

## Understanding Wi-Fi Signal Strength and Range

Wi-Fi signal strength is often the biggest reason your Ring Doorbell disconnects. Your doorbell needs a strong, stable connection to your home router. If the signal is weak, your device will struggle to stay online. This leads to frequent disconnections and missed notifications. We call this signal strength "RSSI" in the Ring app.

RSSI stands for Received Signal Strength Indication. A lower negative number indicates a stronger signal. For example, -40 RSSI is better than -70 RSSI. Ring suggests an RSSI of -60 or stronger for reliable operation. Anything weaker can cause connection problems. You can find your doorbell's RSSI in the Device Health section of the Ring app.

### Optimizing Router Placement

Your router's location makes a big difference. Placing your router too far from the doorbell weakens the signal. Walls, floors, and other obstacles can also block the Wi-Fi signal. Try moving your router closer to the front door. Ensure there are as few physical barriers as possible between them. Every wall or floor reduces signal quality.

Consider placing the router in a central part of your home. This helps distribute Wi-Fi evenly. If your router is in a basement or attic, the signal might struggle to reach your doorbell. Moving it to a main floor often improves connection strength. A clear line of sight helps keep your Ring doorbell connected to your network. This is how the doorbell communicates data. [How does the doorbell ring work](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-does-the-doorbell-ring-work) is based on this connection.

### Using a Wi-Fi Extender or Chime Pro

Sometimes, moving the router is not enough or not possible. In these cases, a Wi-Fi extender or a Ring Chime Pro can help. A Wi-Fi extender boosts your existing Wi-Fi signal. It creates a stronger signal in areas where it is weak. Place the extender halfway between your router and the doorbell. This strengthens the signal reaching your Ring device.

The Ring Chime Pro does more than just chime. It also acts as a Wi-Fi extender for your Ring devices. It is designed to work well with Ring doorbells and cameras. The Chime Pro creates a dedicated Wi-Fi network for your Ring devices. This helps improve their connection stability. It can provide a more reliable signal for your doorbell.

## Addressing Power Supply Issues

A common cause for a Ring Doorbell to disconnect is an unstable power supply. Both wired and battery-powered Ring doorbells need enough power. Without it, the device cannot maintain a steady connection. This can lead to random disconnections or a completely offline device. It is important to check your doorbell's power source first.

For battery-powered Ring doorbells, a low battery is a simple but common cause. When the battery gets too low, the doorbell might conserve power. This can cause it to drop its Wi-Fi connection. Always make sure your battery is fully charged. Ring suggests charging the battery every few months, depending on use. I personally keep an eye on the battery level in the Ring app. You can find information on [how to change Ring doorbell battery](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-ring-doorbell-battery) easily if needed.

### Wired Doorbell Power Needs

Wired Ring doorbells connect to your home's existing doorbell wiring. These devices require a specific voltage range to work correctly. Most Ring doorbells need between 8 and 24 volts AC. If your doorbell transformer provides less than this, it might not supply enough power. This can cause the doorbell to struggle or disconnect. An old or weak transformer might not deliver consistent power.

You can check your transformer's voltage. This usually requires a multimeter. If the voltage is too low, you might need to replace the transformer. Hiring a qualified electrician is a good idea for this task. An improper power supply can cause strange issues. Your Ring Doorbell might even light up unexpectedly or not at all. This relates to issues like [is Ring doorbell light always on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-ring-doorbell-light-always-on) which can indicate a power issue.

### Power Fluctuations and External Factors

Power fluctuations can also cause issues. Brief power outages or brownouts can disrupt your doorbell's connection. While your doorbell might reconnect afterward, repeated fluctuations can harm it. If your home often experiences power issues, consider a surge protector for your router. This protects your network equipment.

Ensure the wiring itself is secure. Loose wires at the doorbell or transformer can cause intermittent power. Check for any corrosion or damage to the wiring. A clean, secure electrical connection is vital for continuous operation. Proper installation is key from the start. Some people wonder [is Ring doorbell hard to install](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-ring-doorbell-hard-to-install). Correct wiring ensures it works well.

## Dealing with Network Interference and Congestion

Wireless networks operate on specific frequencies. Other devices can use these same frequencies. This leads to interference. Interference causes your Ring Doorbell to lose its connection. This is a common problem in busy neighborhoods or homes with many smart devices. Your Wi-Fi signal can get "noisy."

Most Wi-Fi networks use 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands. The 2.4 GHz band has a longer range and better wall penetration. However, it is also more crowded. Many household devices use this band, like microwaves, cordless phones, and baby monitors. These devices can create interference. If your doorbell is using 2.4 GHz, consider checking for other devices nearby.

### Optimizing Wi-Fi Channels

Wi-Fi routers use different channels within each frequency band. If many routers or devices in your area use the same channel, it creates congestion. Think of it like a busy highway. Your data packets get stuck. You can change your router's Wi-Fi channel. This helps avoid crowded channels. Free Wi-Fi analyzer apps can show which channels are less used in your area.

Most routers have an auto-channel selection feature. Sometimes, this does not choose the best channel. Manually selecting a less congested channel can often improve stability. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are non-overlapping for 2.4 GHz. Try one of these if you experience frequent disconnections. This simple change can make a big difference.

### 5 GHz vs. 2.4 GHz for Ring Devices

Some Ring Doorbell models support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi. The 5 GHz band offers faster speeds and less interference. It has more channels and fewer devices use it. However, 5 GHz has a shorter range and struggles with obstacles. If your router is very close to your doorbell, 5 GHz might be a better choice.

If your doorbell is far from the router, stick with 2.4 GHz. Its better range might provide a more stable, though slower, connection. You need to weigh the pros and cons based on your home setup. Make sure your doorbell connects to the band that gives it the best signal. This choice impacts overall connection stability for devices like the Ring doorbell. If your doorbell won't ring, this could be a reason. Learn more about why [my Ring Doorbell won't ring](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-ring-doorbell-ring) in detail.

## Software Glitches and Outdated Firmware

Software problems can also cause your Ring Doorbell to disconnect. Like all smart devices, Ring doorbells run on firmware. This is the operating software of the device itself. The Ring app on your phone also has its own software. If either of these is outdated or has a bug, it can lead to connection issues. Keeping everything updated is important.

Ring regularly releases firmware updates for its devices. These updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements. Sometimes, a known connection problem is solved in a new firmware version. Your doorbell usually updates automatically when connected to power and Wi-Fi. However, if it has been disconnecting, it might miss these updates.

### Checking for Firmware Updates

You cannot manually force a firmware update directly from the Ring app. However, you can ensure your device is in a state to receive them. Keep your doorbell powered and connected to Wi-Fi. If your device consistently disconnects, it might not get the latest firmware. This creates a cycle of problems. A simple solution is to perform a power cycle or a soft reset. This allows the device to re-establish a stable connection. Once connected, it can then check for updates.

Always ensure your Ring app is updated to the latest version. Go to your phone's app store (Google Play Store or Apple App Store). Search for "Ring" and see if an update is available. An outdated app can sometimes have communication problems with your doorbell. This prevents you from seeing the device's true status. It might even show it as offline when it is not, or cause it to disconnect more often.

### Router Firmware and Ring Service Outages

Your home router also has firmware. Router manufacturers release updates to improve performance and security. An outdated router firmware might have bugs. These bugs could cause it to drop connections to certain devices, including your Ring Doorbell. Check your router manufacturer's website for instructions on how to update its firmware. This usually involves logging into your router's administration page.

Very rarely, Ring's own services can experience outages. While these are usually short-lived and affect many users, they can make your doorbell seem disconnected. Check the Ring status page online if you suspect a widespread issue. These are not common, but they can explain a sudden, unexplained disconnection. If you have done all the previous steps, checking for an outage is a good final check.

## Router Overload and Network Issues

Your router manages all internet traffic in your home. Every device connected to your Wi-Fi uses some of your router's resources. This includes phones, tablets, smart TVs, and other smart home gadgets. If you have many devices connected, your router can become overloaded. When a router is overloaded, it struggles to manage all connections. This can cause some devices, like your Ring Doorbell, to disconnect intermittently.

An older router might also be a problem. Older routers might not handle the demands of modern smart homes. They may have less processing power or weaker Wi-Fi radios. Upgrading to a newer, more powerful router can significantly improve network stability. This is especially true if you have many devices using bandwidth. Consider routers with dual-band or tri-band capabilities. These can distribute traffic more efficiently.

### Bandwidth Saturation

Your internet service provider (ISP) gives you a certain amount of bandwidth. This is like the width of a pipe. All your devices share this pipe. If too many devices are streaming video, gaming online, or downloading large files, your bandwidth can become saturated. When bandwidth is full, your Ring Doorbell might struggle to send its video stream. This leads to disconnections.

Think about how your household uses the internet. If you have multiple people streaming in 4K, your doorbell might suffer. While a doorbell does not use as much data as streaming, it still needs enough to function. Reducing overall network use during peak times can help. You can also contact your ISP to see if a higher bandwidth plan is available. A faster internet plan provides a wider "pipe."

### DNS and IP Address Conflicts

Sometimes, network issues are more technical. Your router assigns an IP address to each device. This is like a street address for your doorbell on your network. Occasionally, two devices might try to use the same IP address. This is called an IP address conflict. This conflict causes devices to disconnect. You can try renewing your doorbell's IP lease. This involves turning your doorbell off and on again.

DNS (Domain Name System) issues can also affect connectivity. DNS translates website names into IP addresses. If your router's DNS settings are slow or faulty, your doorbell might struggle to connect to Ring's servers. You can try changing your router's DNS settings to public DNS servers. Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1) are good options. This is an advanced step, but it can resolve unusual connection problems.

## Physical Damage and Environmental Factors

Sometimes, the problem is not electronic but environmental. Your Ring Doorbell sits outside. It faces harsh weather conditions. Extreme heat, cold, rain, or even direct sunlight can affect its performance. Over time, these elements can cause physical damage. This damage leads to intermittent disconnections.

Water damage is a major concern. While Ring doorbells are weather-resistant, they are not completely waterproof. Heavy rain or direct water spray can get inside the unit. This can damage internal components, including the Wi-Fi module. If you see condensation inside the lens or visible water damage, this is likely the cause. You might need to replace the doorbell. Ensuring your doorbell is installed under an overhang helps protect it from direct rain.

### Extreme Temperatures and Sun Exposure

Extreme temperatures can affect electronics. Very cold weather can drain batteries faster and affect performance. Very hot weather, especially direct sunlight, can cause the doorbell to overheat. Overheating can lead to temporary shutdowns or connection drops. Ring doorbells have operating temperature ranges. If your climate is outside this range, your doorbell might struggle.

Consider where your doorbell is mounted. Is it in direct sunlight for many hours? This can contribute to overheating issues. Some users add a small hood or shade above the doorbell to protect it. This simple addition can protect the device from both sun and rain. Physical stress on the mounting or wiring can also cause issues. Make sure the doorbell is securely attached.

### Loose Wiring and Installation Issues

For wired Ring doorbells, loose or corroded wiring at the connection points can cause power interruptions. These interruptions manifest as disconnections. Regularly inspect the wires connecting to your doorbell. Make sure they are secure and free of rust or damage. Old wiring can become brittle or corroded over time.

Even improper installation can lead to long-term issues. If the doorbell was not mounted correctly, it might experience vibrations or stresses. This damages internal components or wiring connections. While [is Ring doorbell hard to install](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-ring-doorbell-hard-to-install) for some, correct installation is important. Make sure you followed all instructions for your model. A stable physical connection is as important as a stable wireless one.

## Advanced Troubleshooting and Reset Options

If you have tried the basic steps and your Ring Doorbell still keeps disconnecting, it is time for more advanced troubleshooting. These steps involve resetting the device or your network. Remember, a factory reset should be a last resort. It removes all your settings and you will need to set up the device again.

First, try a simple power cycle of your Ring Doorbell. For battery-powered models, remove the battery for a few seconds. Then reinsert it. For wired models, briefly turn off the power to your doorbell at the breaker. Wait a minute, then turn it back on. This refreshes the doorbell's connection to your network. This simple step often resolves temporary glitches.

### Restarting Your Router and Modem

Your router and modem are the gateways to the internet. Sometimes, they need a refresh too. Unplug your router and modem from power. Wait for about 60 seconds. Then plug the modem back in first. Wait until its lights are stable. Then plug in your router. Wait for its lights to stabilize. This clears any temporary issues with your network equipment. It also ensures your doorbell gets a fresh IP address.

After restarting your network, check your Ring Doorbell's Device Health in the app. See if the RSSI has improved. See if the device status changes to "Online." If it stays offline, you might need to re-establish the Wi-Fi connection through the app.

### Reconnecting and Re-pairing

If a power cycle does not help, you may need to reconnect your doorbell to your Wi-Fi. Open the Ring app. Go to your doorbell's Device Health settings. Look for an option to "Change Wi-Fi Network." Follow the steps in the app to reconnect your doorbell to your home Wi-Fi. This is similar to the initial setup process. You will need your Wi-Fi network name and password.

If all else fails, a factory reset is an option. This completely wipes the doorbell's settings. It returns it to its original state. The exact steps for a factory reset vary by model. Most Ring doorbells have a small setup button on the back or side. Press and hold this button for 15-20 seconds. The light on the front will flash. After the reset, you must set up your doorbell as if it were new. This means adding it back to your Ring account and connecting it to Wi-Fi.
