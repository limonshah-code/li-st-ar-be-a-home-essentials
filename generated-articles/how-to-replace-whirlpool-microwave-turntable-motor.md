This restores the turntable’s function.

## Understanding Your Whirlpool Microwave Turntable Motor

Your Whirlpool microwave turntable motor is a small, but vital, component. It makes the glass plate inside your microwave spin. This spinning action ensures food heats evenly. Without it, hot and cold spots appear in your meals. This leads to an unsatisfactory cooking experience. The motor typically sits beneath the microwave cavity. It connects to a small shaft that turns the turntable.

Several signs indicate your turntable motor may be failing. The most obvious sign is when the turntable stops spinning completely. You may also hear unusual noises, like grinding or buzzing, from the bottom of the microwave. Sometimes, the plate might spin slowly or intermittently. If you notice your [Whirlpool microwave turntable making noise](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-whirlpool-microwave-turntable-making-noise), it might be a symptom of a motor issue. These noises often suggest internal wear or damage to the motor's gears.

The motor itself can fail for various reasons. General wear and tear is common over years of use. Grease or food debris can accumulate around the motor, hindering its movement. Electrical faults or power surges can also damage the motor windings. Over time, the motor's internal gears can strip or wear out. Identifying these symptoms helps confirm the motor is the problem, not another part. If the motor is the issue, replacing it is the best solution.

## Safety First: Essential Precautions for Microwave Repair

Working on any appliance requires attention to safety. This is especially true for microwaves. Microwaves contain a high-voltage capacitor. This component can store a dangerous electrical charge even after the unit is unplugged. This stored charge can cause a severe electric shock. You must always discharge this capacitor before touching any internal parts. Skipping this step puts you at serious risk.

First, always unplug the microwave from the wall outlet. This cuts off power to the unit. Next, wait a few minutes for residual power to dissipate. Then, you must discharge the capacitor. Use a well-insulated screwdriver with an insulated handle. Touch the metal shaft of the screwdriver across the capacitor's terminals. This will safely discharge any stored electricity. You might see a spark, which is normal.

Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Safety glasses protect your eyes from any sparks or flying debris. Insulated gloves add another layer of protection against electrical shock. Avoid wearing loose clothing or jewelry. These items can get caught in moving parts or conduct electricity. Work in a well-lit and dry area. Clear your workspace of any clutter. Prioritize safety during every step of the repair process. Do not rush any part of the procedure.

## Gathering Your Tools and Replacement Parts

Before starting the repair, collect all necessary tools and the correct replacement part. Having everything ready saves time and frustration. You will need a basic set of screwdrivers. This includes both Phillips head and flathead types. A nut driver or a small socket set may also be helpful. Some models use hex head screws. Pliers can assist with disconnecting wires or holding small parts.

You will also need a multimeter. This tool helps confirm power is off and safely discharge the capacitor. A pair of wire cutters or strippers might be useful if you need to splice wires. A small container or magnetic tray is excellent for holding screws. This prevents losing tiny fasteners during disassembly. Having a clean cloth or paper towels is also good for wiping away any grease or debris.

The most crucial item is the correct replacement turntable motor. Microwave models vary, even within the same brand. You must find the exact part number for your specific Whirlpool microwave. Check the model number on a sticker inside the microwave door or on the back of the unit. Use this model number to search for the correct motor online or at an appliance parts store. An incorrect part may not fit or function properly. Ordering the wrong part wastes time and money. Ensure your new motor matches the voltage and shaft type of the old one.

## Accessing the Turntable Motor in Your Whirlpool Microwave

Accessing the turntable motor typically involves removing the microwave’s outer casing. This process varies slightly between over-the-range and countertop models. For most countertop Whirlpool microwaves, the motor is located underneath the unit. You will need to carefully flip the microwave over. Ensure you have a soft, stable surface for this. A towel or blanket on a table works well.

Once the microwave is upside down, you will see a bottom plate or cover. This plate is usually secured by several screws. Use your screwdriver to remove these screws. Keep them organized in your parts tray. After removing all screws, gently lift off the bottom plate. The turntable motor usually becomes visible. It is a small, cylindrical component often housed in a plastic or metal bracket.

For over-the-range Whirlpool microwaves, accessing the motor might require removing the microwave from its wall mount. This is a more involved process. You may need assistance to safely lower the heavy appliance. Some over-the-range models allow motor access from a side or back panel. Consult your microwave's service manual or diagram for precise instructions. Do not force any covers or panels. Always look for screws or clips holding them in place. Remember to safely store any removed panels or covers.

### Removing the Old Turntable Motor

With the bottom plate removed, you can now focus on the old turntable motor. The motor typically connects to the microwave's internal wiring with two wires. These wires often have spade connectors or are directly wired into a terminal block. Carefully observe how these wires connect. Take a photo with your phone if it helps you remember. This ensures correct reassembly later.

Disconnect the wires from the motor terminals. You might need pliers to gently pull off spade connectors if they are tight. If the wires are screwed into a terminal block, use a screwdriver to loosen the screws. Avoid pulling directly on the wires themselves. Always grasp the connector or the plastic part of the wire connection. This prevents damaging the wiring.

Next, remove the screws holding the motor in its mounting bracket. There are usually two or three small screws. Once these screws are out, the motor should be free. Some motors might have a shaft that extends through a hole in the microwave floor. Carefully pull the motor down and out from its housing. Inspect the old motor for any obvious signs of damage or wear. This helps confirm it was the faulty component. Dispose of the old motor responsibly.

## Installing Your New Whirlpool Microwave Turntable Motor

Now, it's time to install the new Whirlpool microwave turntable motor. Take your new motor and align its shaft with the hole in the microwave floor. Ensure it fits snugly into the mounting bracket. The motor should seat properly without forcing it. Pay attention to the orientation of the motor. It often only fits one way.

Secure the new motor into place using the screws you removed earlier. Tighten these screws firmly, but do not overtighten them. Overtightening can strip the screw threads or crack the motor housing. Make sure the motor is stable and does not wobble. This prevents future noise or malfunction.

Reconnect the electrical wires to the new motor's terminals. Refer to the photo you took earlier or recall the original wiring configuration. Ensure the wires are connected correctly to the appropriate terminals. If they are spade connectors, push them firmly until they click into place. If they are screw terminals, tighten the screws securely. Double-check all connections. Loose connections can cause intermittent operation or electrical issues. This step completes the physical installation of the new motor.

### Reassembling and Testing Your Microwave

After installing the new motor, it is time to reassemble your microwave. Carefully place the bottom plate or cover back onto the unit. Align it properly with the screw holes. Replace all the screws you removed earlier. Tighten them securely, but avoid overtightening. Ensure all panels are firmly attached. This prevents vibration and maintains structural integrity.

Once the microwave is fully reassembled, place it back in its normal position. Plug the microwave back into a grounded electrical outlet. Now, you can perform a test. Place a cup of water on the turntable plate inside the microwave. Close the door firmly. If your microwave also has issues with the door, you might want to review how to [replace a Whirlpool microwave door switch](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-whirlpool-microwave-door-switch). Set the microwave to run for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Observe the turntable. It should now spin smoothly.

If the turntable spins, your repair was successful. Check the water in the cup. It should be hot. Listen for any unusual noises. If the turntable still does not spin, or you hear strange sounds, unplug the unit immediately. Recheck your connections and ensure the motor is properly seated. Sometimes, a component other than the motor might be faulty. However, the turntable motor is the most common culprit for a non-spinning plate.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues After Motor Replacement

Even after replacing the turntable motor, you might encounter some issues. The most common problem is the turntable still not spinning. First, double-check all electrical connections. Ensure the wires are firmly attached to the new motor. Sometimes, a loose connection can prevent power from reaching the motor. Also, confirm the motor shaft is correctly engaged with the turntable support. If the plate is not aligned, it cannot spin.

Another issue could be unusual noises after replacement. A new motor should run quietly. If you hear grinding or buzzing, the motor might not be seated correctly. Recheck the mounting screws. They might be too loose or too tight. Also, inspect the turntable support and rollers under the glass plate. These can wear out and cause noise. If the glass plate itself is cracked or warped, it can also cause problems. Ensure the new motor is the exact replacement part. An incompatible motor might cause issues.

If the motor runs but the plate does not spin, the issue might be with the turntable coupling. This is the plastic piece that connects the motor shaft to the glass plate. It can wear out or break over time. Replace this coupling if it appears damaged. If none of these steps resolve the issue, consult the microwave's service manual or contact a professional technician. While motor replacement is common, other complex electrical issues might be present.
