## Bake Perfect Cakes: How To Use Cake Pan In Instant Pot

Have you ever thought about baking a cake in your Instant Pot? It might sound unusual, but pressure cooking cakes gives them an incredibly moist texture. Many home cooks discover the Instant Pot is a secret weapon for desserts. Using a cake pan in Instant Pot opens up a new world of baking. I have personally found this method reliable for consistent results.

This guide helps you understand everything about Instant Pot cake baking. We will cover choosing the right cake pan and necessary accessories. I will give you a clear, step-by-step process. You will also learn tips for releasing your cake and solving common problems. Get ready to impress yourself and others with your Instant Pot baking skills.

### Takeaway

*   Choose the correct cake pan size and material for your Instant Pot.
*   Always use a trivet or sling to lift the cake pan.
*   Add the right amount of water for proper pressure cooking.
*   Follow specific cook times and release methods for best results.

To use a cake pan in your Instant Pot, select a pan that fits inside the pot, usually 6 or 7 inches. Place the cake batter in the pan, cover it, and set it on a trivet inside the Instant Pot with water. Pressure cook according to your recipe, then allow for natural pressure release before carefully removing the cake.

## Choosing the Right Cake Pan for Your Instant Pot

Picking the right cake pan is the first step to successful Instant Pot baking. Not all cake pans work well in a pressure cooker. You need to consider both the material and the size. I learned this the hard way with a pan that was too big.

### Material Matters: Silicone vs. Metal Pans

When you bake in an Instant Pot, the pan sits in a moist, high-pressure environment. This means certain materials perform better than others. Silicone cake pans are popular for Instant Pot baking. They are flexible, non-stick, and handle heat well. Many people find cakes release easily from silicone pans.

Metal pans also work, but some types are better. Anodized aluminum pans are great because they heat evenly. Stainless steel pans are durable and safe for pressure cooking. Avoid dark-colored metal pans if you are worried about over-baking. Light-colored metal pans reflect heat better. Some metal pans have a non-stick coating. Be sure the coating is safe for high temperatures and steam.

A springform pan with a removable bottom is another excellent choice. These are perfect for cheesecakes or delicate cakes. You might need to wrap the bottom in foil to prevent water from seeping in. If you want to know more about these, check out [How To Use Cake Pan With Removable Bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-cake-pan-with-removable-bottom). Both silicone and metal pans have pros and cons. Silicone pans are easy to clean and store. Metal pans often give a slightly crisper edge, even in a moist environment.

### Size and Shape Considerations

The size of your cake pan is critical. It must fit inside the Instant Pot's inner pot. Most 6-quart Instant Pots fit a 6-inch or 7-inch round cake pan. Some larger 8-quart models can fit an 8-inch pan. Measure your Instant Pot's inner diameter before buying a pan. This prevents frustration when your new pan does not fit.

Round pans are the most common shape used for Instant Pot cakes. Square or rectangular pans are usually too wide for the Instant Pot's circular shape. Bundt pans are also an option, but ensure they are small enough to fit. Consider the height of your pan as well. A taller pan might hit the lid, especially if you add a tall trivet.

Knowing your pan's size is simple. You can measure across the top of the pan from one inner edge to the other. If you are unsure, this guide helps you [How To Tell What Size Your Cake Pan Is](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-what-size-your-cake-pan-is). Choosing the right size ensures proper cooking and easy removal. A pan that is too large will not fit. A pan that is too small might not cook evenly.

## Essential Accessories for Instant Pot Baking

Using a cake pan in your Instant Pot requires more than just the pan itself. Certain accessories are vital for successful baking. They ensure your cake cooks properly and you can safely remove it. I always double-check I have these before I start.

### The Importance of a Trivet or Sling

A trivet is a metal rack that sits at the bottom of your Instant Pot's inner pot. It keeps your cake pan elevated above the water. This is crucial for pressure cooking. Without a trivet, your cake pan would sit directly in the water. This would result in a soggy, ruined cake. Most Instant Pots come with a metal trivet. It usually has handles, which makes it even more useful.

A sling is an accessory that works with your trivet. It is often made of silicone or foil. A silicone sling looks like a cradle with handles. You place your cake pan in the sling, then lower the sling and pan into the Instant Pot using the handles. This makes removing the hot pan much safer and easier.

If you do not have a dedicated sling, you can make one from aluminum foil. Fold a long piece of foil into a thick strip. Place it under your cake pan, then bring the ends up along the sides. These ends act as handles for lifting the pan. Always use a trivet and a sling (or foil handles). This prevents your cake from getting wet and makes handling the hot pan simple.

### Using Parchment Paper and Foil

Parchment paper and aluminum foil are helpful for Instant Pot baking. Parchment paper lines the bottom of your cake pan. This prevents the cake from sticking. It also makes cleanup easier. Cut a circle of parchment paper to fit the bottom of your pan. You can also line the sides if your pan is not non-stick.

Aluminum foil serves several purposes. First, you can use it to cover your cake pan. This prevents condensation from dripping onto your cake's surface. Water droplets can make your cake soggy or unevenly cooked. Foil also helps keep the cake pan clean during cooking. It protects the cake from direct steam. Second, as mentioned, you can create a foil sling. This helps you lift the hot cake pan safely.

Some people even wrap the bottom of a springform pan in foil. This offers extra protection against water leaks. I always wrap my cheesecake pan in foil to be safe. You can also use foil to create a steam barrier around your cake. This helps ensure even cooking. Always make sure the foil cover does not touch the inner lid of the Instant Pot. Leave some space for steam circulation.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How To Use a Cake Pan in Instant Pot

Baking a cake in your Instant Pot is straightforward once you know the steps. I find it less intimidating than traditional oven baking. This process ensures your cake cooks evenly and comes out perfectly moist. Let us go through it together.

### Preparing Your Cake Pan

Before you add any batter, prepare your cake pan properly. First, grease the pan generously. You can use butter, shortening, or a non-stick cooking spray. Make sure to cover the bottom and sides. This helps prevent the cake from sticking.

Next, line the bottom with parchment paper. Cut a circle of parchment paper to fit the pan's base. Place it inside the greased pan. This extra step provides a non-stick barrier. It makes cake release much easier. If you use a springform pan, remember to wrap the bottom of the pan securely with aluminum foil. This prevents any water from seeping into your cake batter during cooking. Wrap it tightly around the base and up the sides.

Once your pan is greased and lined, pour your prepared cake batter into it. Do not fill the pan more than two-thirds full. This allows room for the cake to rise without overflowing. Level the top of the batter gently with a spatula. Finally, cover the top of the cake pan. You can use aluminum foil or the pan's own lid if it has one. This cover keeps condensation from dripping onto your cake.

### Adding Water to the Instant Pot

Adding the right amount of water to the Instant Pot's inner pot is crucial. The water creates the steam needed for pressure cooking. For most Instant Pot cake recipes, you need at least 1 cup of water. Some larger recipes might call for 1.5 or 2 cups. Refer to your specific recipe for the exact amount.

Pour the water directly into the bottom of the stainless steel inner pot. Make sure the water level is below the trivet you will place inside. The trivet keeps your cake pan out of the water. If there is too little water, the Instant Pot may not come to pressure. It might even give you a "burn" error. Too much water is not usually a problem, but it is unnecessary.

Using warm water can help the Instant Pot come to pressure faster. This saves a few minutes of preheating time. However, cold water works just fine too. Just be consistent with the amount. This ensures uniform cooking conditions.

### Lowering the Pan into the Pot

Now it is time to carefully place your prepared cake pan into the Instant Pot. First, put your trivet into the bottom of the inner pot. Make sure it is stable. If your trivet has handles, extend them upwards.

Next, place your covered cake pan onto the trivet. If you made a foil sling or have a silicone sling, use it now. Position the sling under the pan. Then, use the sling handles to lower the pan gently onto the trivet. Make sure the pan is centered and stable. The handles of the sling should extend above the rim of the Instant Pot. This makes it easy to lift the hot pan out later.

Do not let the cake pan touch the sides of the Instant Pot directly. The trivet ensures proper air circulation. It also keeps the pan elevated from the water. Always be gentle to avoid sloshing the batter.

### Sealing and Setting the Cook Time

Once the cake pan is inside, close the Instant Pot lid. Make sure the lid is properly aligned and locked into place. Rotate the steam release handle to the "Sealing" position. This is very important for building pressure. If it is on "Venting," the pot will not pressurize.

Next, select the cooking program. Most cakes use the "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" setting. Adjust the cooking time according to your cake recipe. A standard 6-inch cake might take 25-35 minutes. Cheesecakes often take longer, around 45-50 minutes. Always use high pressure.

Once you set the time, the Instant Pot will begin to pressurize. This takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the water temperature and pot size. The float valve will rise when pressure is reached. The countdown timer will then begin. When cooking finishes, the Instant Pot will beep. This signals that your cake is ready for the next step.

## Mastering Instant Pot Cake Release and Cooling

After your Instant Pot finishes cooking, the job is not quite done. Proper pressure release and cooling are key for a perfect cake. Rushing these steps can ruin your hard work. I learned this after one too many collapsed cakes.

### Releasing Pressure Safely

There are two main ways to release pressure from your Instant Pot: Natural Pressure Release (NPR) and Quick Release (QR). For cakes, Natural Pressure Release is almost always the best option. Natural Release means you do nothing after the cooking time ends. The Instant Pot slowly depressurizes on its own. This process can take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, sometimes longer. The float valve will drop when all pressure is gone.

Why use Natural Release for cakes? It allows the cake to cool down gradually. This prevents the cake from shrinking too quickly or cracking. It also helps set the cake's structure. If you use Quick Release, the sudden change in pressure can cause the cake to deflate or become dense. This is especially true for delicate items like cheesecakes.

Only use Quick Release if your recipe specifically calls for it. Even then, it is rare for cakes. For most cakes, let the Instant Pot sit until the float valve drops. Once the valve drops, you can safely open the lid. Be careful of any residual steam.

### Cooling Your Cake Properly

Once the pressure is fully released and you have opened the lid, carefully lift the cake pan out of the Instant Pot. Use your sling or foil handles for this. The pan will be very hot. Place the cake pan on a wire cooling rack. This allows air to circulate around the bottom of the pan. This helps the cake cool evenly.

Let the cake cool in the pan for about 10-15 minutes. This cooling period is important. It allows the cake to firm up. It also helps the cake pull away from the sides of the pan. Trying to remove a hot cake too soon can cause it to break. After this initial cooling, gently run a thin knife or spatula around the edges of the pan. This helps loosen the cake.

Now, you can invert the cake onto the wire rack to finish cooling. If you used a springform pan, simply unlatch the sides and lift them away. Then, slide the cake off the base or transfer it. For regular pans, place another wire rack or plate on top of the cake, then carefully flip it over. Lift off the pan. Let the cake cool completely on the rack before frosting or serving. A completely cooled cake is easier to frost and slice. For tips on removing cakes, see [How To Get Cake Out Of Cake Pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-cake-out-of-cake-pan).

## Troubleshooting Common Instant Pot Baking Issues

Even with the right steps, baking in an Instant Pot can sometimes present challenges. Do not worry; most problems have simple solutions. I have faced these issues myself and learned how to fix them. Knowing what to do helps you achieve perfect results.

### Cake Not Cooked Through

If your cake comes out of the Instant Pot undercooked, there are a few likely culprits. The most common reason is insufficient cooking time. Instant Pot recipes can vary, and cooking times depend on the cake density and pan size. If your cake is still jiggly in the center, it needs more time.

Another reason could be that the Instant Pot did not reach full pressure. This can happen if the steam release handle was not on "Sealing." Or, perhaps the sealing ring was not properly seated. Make sure the ring is clean and fits snugly. For general Instant Pot cleaning, refer to [How To Clean An Instant Pot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-an-instant-pot). If the cake is undercooked, you can put it back in the Instant Pot. Add 5-10 more minutes of pressure cooking time. Always do a Natural Release after.

Sometimes, too much moisture in the batter can prevent proper cooking. Ensure you follow the recipe's liquid measurements exactly. If the cake is too wet, it might not set. Using a smaller pan than recommended for the recipe might also cause undercooking. The cake will be thicker and need more time.

### Watery Cake Surface

A watery or wet surface on your cake after Instant Pot baking is common. This happens because of condensation. As the pot cools, steam inside the lid turns into water droplets. These droplets can fall onto your cake. Covering your cake pan with aluminum foil helps prevent this.

Ensure the foil cover is tight. It should completely seal the top of your cake pan. You can even create a dome with the foil. This keeps the foil from touching the cake. If you still get a little moisture, gently blot the top with a paper towel. Do this right after removing the cake from the Instant Pot.

Another tip is to make sure there is enough space between your covered cake pan and the Instant Pot lid. If they touch, water can still transfer. Some people even put a clean paper towel or thin cloth over the foil before closing the Instant Pot lid. This absorbs any excess condensation. Remember to remove it quickly after cooking.

### Cake Stuck to the Pan

A cake sticking to the pan is frustrating. It often results in a broken cake. The main reasons for this are not greasing the pan enough or not using parchment paper. Always grease your pan generously before adding batter. Use butter, shortening, or non-stick spray.

Lining the bottom of the pan with parchment paper is also essential. This provides an extra layer of non-stick protection. Cut a circle of parchment paper to fit the bottom of your pan perfectly. I always do this for every Instant Pot cake I bake.

If your cake still sticks, it might be due to removing it too soon. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes on a wire rack. This lets the cake firm up. It also allows the cake to naturally pull away from the pan's sides. Running a thin knife or offset spatula around the edge of the cake before inverting it can also help.

This extra care helps keep your cake intact.

## Beyond Cakes: Other Treats to Make

The Instant Pot is not just for savory meals. It is a fantastic tool for desserts, especially when using a cake pan. Beyond traditional cakes, you can make a variety of delicious treats. I often experiment with new dessert ideas in my Instant Pot.

Cheesecakes are a prime example. They are incredibly popular to make in the Instant Pot. The pressure cooking environment creates a perfectly smooth, crack-free cheesecake every time. The moist heat helps prevent the dry edges often seen in oven-baked cheesecakes. You use a springform pan for these. Remember to wrap the pan in foil to keep water out.

You can also make various bread puddings in a cake pan inside your Instant Pot. The result is a custardy, warm dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is another excellent choice. The Instant Pot steams these puddings beautifully. This gives them a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture.

Brownies and blondies can also be made in a cake pan in the Instant Pot. While they might not get the crispy top of oven-baked versions, they turn out incredibly moist and fudgy. Experiment with different cake pan sizes and shapes to see what fits best. You might even try smaller ramekins for individual portions. Just remember the basic principles: trivet, water, covered pan, and natural pressure release. This versatility makes the Instant Pot a dessert powerhouse.
