## Where to Locate Your Kenmore Refrigerator Serial Number

Finding your Kenmore refrigerator's serial number is usually simple. Kenmore places these labels in common, accessible spots. However, the exact location can vary. It depends on the model and the year it was manufactured. I find it easiest to check inside the fresh food compartment first.

Most modern Kenmore refrigerators have the serial number label inside the fresh food section. Look along the top walls. It might be on the side walls. Sometimes it is found near the ice maker assembly. This label often includes both the model number and the serial number.

**Common Locations for Kenmore Refrigerator Serial Numbers:**

*   **Inside the Refrigerator Compartment:** This is the most frequent spot. Open the main refrigerator door. Look on the left or right sidewall. It can also be on the ceiling or behind the crisper drawers. Sometimes, it is located on the frame just inside the door opening.
*   **On the Appliance Frame:** Open both refrigerator doors. Look at the frame dividing the two compartments. Some older models have the label here.
*   **Behind the Kick Plate/Grille:** For some models, especially older ones, the label might be near the bottom of the refrigerator. You may need to remove the front kick plate or grille. This is a plastic or metal cover at the very base of the appliance.
*   **On the Back of the Refrigerator:** In rare cases, especially with built-in models, the label could be on the back of the unit. This location makes it harder to access. You might need to pull the refrigerator out from the wall. I always check inside first to avoid this hassle.
*   **Near the Compressor:** Occasionally, the label is on or near the compressor. This is at the back bottom of the refrigerator. This area can be dusty and difficult to see.

The label is usually a white or silver sticker. It has black text. The serial number is often printed prominently. It stands out from the other numbers. It may be labeled "SERIAL NO." or "S/N." Take a clear photo of the label once you find it. This saves you from searching again later. You can also use this information to [tell which Kenmore refrigerator you have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-which-kenmore-refrigerator-i-have).

## Decoding Kenmore Refrigerator Serial Number Formats

Kenmore is a brand name. It is not a manufacturer. This means different companies make Kenmore appliances. Whirlpool, LG, GE, and Frigidaire are common Kenmore manufacturers. Each manufacturer uses its own serial number format. This makes decoding Kenmore serial numbers a bit more involved.

Despite the variations, there are common patterns. Many manufacturers embed the manufacturing date within the serial number. This date is often represented by a code. It can be two digits for the year and two for the week. Other formats use a letter for the year. This helps you [find out how old your Kenmore refrigerator is](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-how-old-your-kenmore-refrigerator-is).

**Common Serial Number Formats by Manufacturer (for Kenmore):**

*   **Whirlpool-Made Kenmore (often starts with 106, 110, 596):** Whirlpool often uses a serial number that is 10 characters long. The first two characters are letters. These letters represent the year and week of manufacture. For example, a serial number starting with "CS" might mean the refrigerator was made in a specific year and week. I remember "C" usually means a particular year, and "S" indicates the week.
    *   **Example Format:** **LL**DDDDDDDD (L=Letter, D=Digit)
    *   The first letter is the year code.
    *   The second letter is the week code (often A=1st week, B=2nd week, etc.).
*   **LG-Made Kenmore (often starts with 795):** LG serial numbers typically follow a different pattern. They are usually 10 or 12 digits long. The first digit often represents the year. The next two digits represent the month. So, "803" would mean March 2018. This format is quite straightforward for me.
    *   **Example Format:** **YMM**DDDDDDD (Y=Year digit, M=Month digits, D=Digit)
    *   The first digit indicates the last digit of the manufacturing year (e.g., 8 for 2018).
    *   The next two digits indicate the manufacturing month (e.g., 03 for March).
*   **Frigidaire-Made Kenmore (often starts with 253):** Frigidaire serial numbers are often 9 or 10 digits. The first letter typically indicates the manufacturing plant. The next two digits represent the year. The following two digits are the week. So, "LA824XXXXX" would mean the 24th week of 2008.
    *   **Example Format:** L**YYWW**DDDD (L=Plant Letter, Y=Year digits, W=Week digits, D=Digit)
    *   The second and third digits are the last two digits of the year (e.g., 08 for 2008).
    *   The fourth and fifth digits are the manufacturing week (e.g., 24 for the 24th week).
*   **GE-Made Kenmore (often starts with 362):** GE serial numbers can be complex. They often use a combination of letters and numbers. The date code is usually represented by two letters. The first letter is for the month. The second letter is for the year. For example, "AL" might mean January of a certain year.
    *   **Example Format:** **LM**DDDDDDD (L=Month letter, M=Year letter, D=Digit)
    *   A lookup table is needed for GE date codes.

I always recommend finding the model number first. Then you can identify the original manufacturer. This helps narrow down the serial number format. Knowing the manufacturer makes decoding much easier.

## Extracting the Manufacturing Date from Your Serial Number

The manufacturing date is one of the most important pieces of information. It is hidden within your Kenmore refrigerator serial number. Kenmore itself does not make appliances. This means you need to know which company manufactured your specific Kenmore unit. The model number often gives a clue. The first three digits of a Kenmore model number usually identify the actual manufacturer.

For instance, model numbers starting with "106" or "110" are typically Whirlpool. "795" usually points to LG. "253" indicates Frigidaire. "362" suggests GE. Once you identify the manufacturer, you can apply their specific serial number decoding rules.

**Common Date Code Formats Based on Manufacturer:**

*   **Whirlpool (106, 110, 596 prefixes):**
    *   Whirlpool uses a 10-digit serial number. The first letter represents the year. The second letter represents the week of that year.
    *   **Year Codes:** G=2018, H=2019, J=2020, K=2021, L=2022, M=2023, N=2024, P=2025 (They skip I, O, Q for clarity).
    *   **Week Codes:** A=Week 01, B=Week 02, C=Week 03, up to Z=Week 52.
    *   **Example:** A serial number starting "GR" means the refrigerator was made in 2018 (G) during the 18th week (R is the 18th letter). This system is very common.
*   **LG (795 prefix):**
    *   LG serial numbers are usually 10-12 digits. The first digit is the last digit of the year. The next two digits are the month.
    *   **Example:** A serial number starting "203KLYR..." means it was made in 2022 (2) in March (03). If it were "811" it would be November 2018 or 2008. Context helps determine the decade.
*   **Frigidaire (253 prefix):**
    *   Frigidaire uses a format where the second and third digits are the year. The fourth and fifth digits are the week.
    *   **Example:** A serial number like "XA92456789" means it was made in 2009 (9) in the 24th week (24). If it were "XJ10..." it would be the 10th week of 2019.
*   **GE (362 prefix):**
    *   GE's date codes are often two letters. The first letter represents the month. The second letter represents the year. This requires a specific GE date code chart.
    *   **Month Letters:** A=Jan, D=Feb, G=Mar, H=Apr, L=May, M=Jun, R=Jul, S=Aug, T=Sep, V=Oct, Z=Nov, B=Dec.
    *   **Year Letters:** V=2010, Z=2011, A=2012, D=2013, F=2014, G=2015, H=2016, J=2017, L=2018, P=2019, R=2020, S=2021, T=2022, V=2023, Z=2024.
    *   **Example:** "SZ" means August (S) 2024 (Z).

Always cross-reference with your specific model number. This ensures you are using the correct manufacturer's decoding system. It makes the process accurate.

## Understanding Kenmore's Unique Serial Number Characteristics

Kenmore is a unique brand. It does not manufacture its own appliances. Instead, Sears, the owner of Kenmore, partners with various manufacturers. These manufacturers produce appliances under the Kenmore name. This means a Kenmore refrigerator could be made by Whirlpool, LG, GE, or Frigidaire, among others. This characteristic makes Kenmore serial numbers distinct. They follow the serial number conventions of the actual manufacturer, not a single Kenmore standard.

This manufacturing model impacts how you interpret the serial number. You must first identify the true manufacturer. You can often do this by looking at the model number. The first three digits of the model number before the decimal point usually reveal the manufacturer's code. For example:

*   **106, 110, 596:** These are codes for Whirlpool-produced Kenmore appliances.
*   **795:** This code indicates LG Electronics is the manufacturer.
*   **253:** This signifies that Frigidaire (Electrolux) produced the appliance.
*   **362:** This code typically points to GE Appliances.

Knowing the manufacturer is the first step. Once you know this, you can apply the correct decoding method. Each manufacturer has its own system for embedding information. This includes the manufacturing date and plant codes. For instance, a Whirlpool-made Kenmore will have a serial number structure. This structure is identical to other Whirlpool-branded appliances. The same applies to LG, Frigidaire, and GE.

This unique characteristic means you are not learning one "Kenmore" serial number system. Instead, you are learning several. These systems correspond to the major appliance manufacturers. This flexibility allows Kenmore to offer a wide range of products. It also means a slightly more complex decoding process for the consumer. However, once you identify the manufacturer, the process becomes straightforward. Always remember the brand is Kenmore, but the internal workings follow the actual manufacturer's design. This applies to troubleshooting too. If your Kenmore refrigerator is not cooling enough, understanding the manufacturer's specific design helps find the root cause. [This article explains why your Kenmore refrigerator is not cold enough](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-refrigerator-not-cold-enough).

## Beyond the Basics: What Else Your Serial Number Tells You

A Kenmore refrigerator serial number contains more than just the manufacturing date. It often holds details about the specific production run. It can even indicate the plant where the appliance was assembled. These additional details are useful for professionals and curious owners alike. They provide a deeper insight into your appliance's origins.

Many manufacturers embed a plant code. This code is usually a letter or a number. It identifies the specific factory where the appliance was built. For instance, a Whirlpool serial number might use a specific digit at the end. This digit indicates one of their many manufacturing facilities. This information is usually not needed by homeowners. However, it can be useful for recall tracking or supply chain analysis.

**Decoding Production Details:**

*   **Production Sequence:** After the date code, the remaining digits in the serial number often represent a sequential production number. This means your refrigerator was the X-th unit made during that specific week or month. This helps track specific batches. It is a way for manufacturers to manage quality control.
*   **Factory Codes:** Some serial numbers include a specific letter or number. This letter or number identifies the manufacturing plant. This is more common with manufacturers like Frigidaire. Their serial numbers often begin with a plant code.
*   **Feature Indicators (Less Common):** In rare cases, some serial number segments might subtly indicate a specific feature or configuration. This is not a standard practice. It is more likely found in internal manufacturer codes. Most features are identified by the model number. The serial number confirms the specific instance of that model.

For example, if your Kenmore refrigerator freezer is not freezing, the serial number won't directly tell you the cause. However, it identifies the exact model and production batch. This information helps a technician look up specific technical bulletins related to that batch. [This guide explains why your Kenmore refrigerator freezer is not freezing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-refrigerator-freezer-not-freezing).

Understanding these deeper codes is usually for service technicians. It is for those who need precise details for diagnostics. For the average homeowner, knowing the manufacturing date is the primary benefit. Still, recognizing that these numbers hold more information is interesting. It shows the detailed tracking manufacturers maintain.

6.  **Check Warranty Status:** Provide your serial number to Kenmore customer service or the manufacturer's support line. They can quickly check if your refrigerator is still under warranty. This saves you from paying for repairs that are covered.

Always be precise when giving out your serial number. Double-check the digits. A single mistake can lead to ordering the wrong part or receiving incorrect service information. Having the serial number ready streamlines the entire process. It makes appliance maintenance much less stressful.

## Common Challenges When Finding or Reading Serial Numbers

Finding and reading your Kenmore refrigerator serial number usually goes smoothly. However, sometimes I encounter challenges. These issues can make the process frustrating. Knowing about them helps you prepare. It allows you to overcome these obstacles efficiently.

One common problem is the label's condition. Over time, labels can become faded or damaged. They might be covered by grime or food spills. This makes the numbers hard to read. Older refrigerators are especially prone to this. The ink can wear off, or the sticker might peel away.

**Solutions to Common Challenges:**

*   **Faded or Damaged Labels:**
    *   **Use a Flashlight:** A bright flashlight can make faded numbers more visible. Angle the light from different directions. This can help the digits stand out.
    *   **Take a Photo:** Sometimes, your phone camera can pick up details your eyes miss. Take a high-resolution photo. Zoom in to read the numbers. Adjust the brightness or contrast of the image.
    *   **Gentle Cleaning:** If the label is dirty, gently wipe it with a damp cloth. Use mild soap if needed. Avoid harsh chemicals that could further damage the label.
*   **Hard-to-Reach Locations:**
    *   **Clear the Area:** Remove any food, shelves, or drawers that block the label. This gives you better access and light.
    *   **Use a Mirror:** For labels located on the back or in very tight spots, a small mirror can help. Hold the mirror to reflect the label, and use a flashlight.
    *   **Patience and Angle:** Sometimes, you just need to get on your hands and knees. Try different angles to see the label clearly. It can be awkward.
*   **Confusing Model vs. Serial Number:**
    *   The label often has several numbers. Look for "MODEL NO." or "MDL." for the model number. Look for "SERIAL NO." or "S/N" for the serial number.
    *   Serial numbers are usually longer and have a more randomized appearance. Model numbers are typically structured with letters and numbers indicating features.
*   **Manufacturer Variations:**
    *   Remember that Kenmore appliances are made by different manufacturers. If the first decoding attempt fails, consider which manufacturer might have made your specific unit. Check the model number prefix. This helps determine the correct serial number format.
    *   Online resources or manufacturer websites sometimes have guides specific to their serial number formats.

Do not give up if you face a challenge. Most serial numbers are readable with a little effort. Persistence pays off. Once you have the number, record it somewhere safe. I keep a copy in my appliance maintenance log. This saves me from having to search for it again.
