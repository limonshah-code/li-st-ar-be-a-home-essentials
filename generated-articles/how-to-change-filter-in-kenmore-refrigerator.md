Many people overlook one small but vital component: the filter. Knowing how to change filter in Kenmore refrigerator models ensures you always have clean, healthy water and helps keep your food fresh.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know. We will explore the types of filters in Kenmore refrigerators. You will learn when to replace them. We will provide clear, step-by-step instructions for changing both water and air filters. Finally, we will cover how to reset the filter light and troubleshoot common issues. Get ready to improve your home water quality and food freshness with a simple filter change.

### Takeaway

*   Regularly changing your Kenmore refrigerator filters ensures clean water and fresh food.
*   Locate your specific filter type and model number for correct replacement.
*   Follow simple steps to remove old filters and install new ones.
*   Always reset the filter indicator light after a change.
*   Address any leaks or issues promptly to maintain refrigerator performance.

Changing a filter in your Kenmore refrigerator involves locating the old filter, usually a water filter or air filter, twisting or pushing it out, inserting the new filter of the correct type, and then running water through the system or resetting the air filter indicator.

## Understanding Your Kenmore Refrigerator Filters

Kenmore refrigerators often use two main types of filters. These are the water filter and the air filter. Each filter performs a specific function. Understanding their roles is the first step to proper maintenance.

### Water Filters: What They Do and Why They Matter

Kenmore refrigerator water filters clean your drinking water. They remove contaminants like chlorine, lead, cysts, and sediment. This makes your water taste better. It also makes your ice cubes clearer. A working water filter protects your health. It ensures the water you consume is safe.

Over time, these filters trap many particles. This reduces their effectiveness. A clogged water filter can slow down water dispensing. It can also cause off-tastes or odors. Regular replacement prevents these problems. It also extends the life of your refrigerator's water dispenser.

### Air Filters: Keeping Food Fresh and Odor-Free

Some Kenmore refrigerators also have an air filter. This filter cleans the air inside your fresh food compartment. It removes odors. It also absorbs ethylene gas. Ethylene gas is produced by some fruits and vegetables. It speeds up the ripening process.

A clean air filter helps food stay fresh longer. It prevents odors from transferring between foods. For example, onions will not make your milk taste strange. If your refrigerator smells bad, the air filter might be clogged. Changing it will make a big difference in food preservation.

## When to Replace Your Kenmore Refrigerator Filters

Knowing when to replace your filters is important. It ensures your Kenmore refrigerator functions at its best. It also maintains water quality and food freshness. There are general guidelines and specific indicators to watch for.

### Water Filter Replacement Schedule

Most Kenmore refrigerator manufacturers recommend changing the water filter every six months. This is a general guideline. Your household's water usage affects this schedule. If you use your water dispenser a lot, you might need to change it more often. If you have very hard water, it might also clog faster.

Do not wait for problems to appear. A proactive approach is best. Mark your calendar. Set a reminder on your phone. Regular changes keep your water clean and your refrigerator running smoothly. This simple task protects your appliance and your health.

### Air Filter Replacement Schedule

Kenmore air filters typically need changing less often than water filters. The usual recommendation is every six to twelve months. Again, this depends on usage and food storage habits. If you store many pungent foods, you might need to change it more frequently.

Some Kenmore refrigerators have indicator lights for air filters, just like water filters. Pay attention to these indicators. If your refrigerator starts to smell, that is a clear sign. Do not ignore these subtle cues. Fresh air inside your fridge keeps food tasting its best.

### Signs It's Time for a Filter Change

Your Kenmore refrigerator often tells you when it is time for a filter change. The most common sign is the filter indicator light. This light typically turns orange or red. It means the filter has reached its lifespan. Trust this light as your primary reminder.

Beyond the light, other signs point to a clogged filter. You might notice slower water dispensing from the dispenser. The water stream might become weaker. The taste or smell of your water can change. It might have a metallic or chlorine taste. For air filters, persistent odors inside the refrigerator are a strong indicator. If your food seems to spoil faster, the air filter may be failing. Pay attention to these changes for optimal performance.

## Identifying the Correct Kenmore Refrigerator Water Filter

Before you can change your Kenmore refrigerator water filter, you need the correct replacement. Using the wrong filter can cause leaks. It can also damage your refrigerator. There are several ways to ensure you get the right one.

Start by checking your owner's manual. The manual lists the exact filter model number. It also provides instructions for replacement. If you do not have the manual, look for a label on your current filter. The filter itself usually has a part number printed on it. Write this number down carefully.

You can also find the part number on the refrigerator's model number sticker. This sticker is often inside the refrigerator compartment. It might be on a side wall or near the top. Sometimes it is on the outer back panel. Once you have your refrigerator's model number, you can look up the correct filter online. Many online parts retailers have compatibility charts. They help you find the right filter for your specific Kenmore model. Understanding [what water filter does my Kenmore refrigerator use](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-water-filter-does-my-kenmore-refrigerator-use) is critical for a successful replacement.

Kenmore refrigerators use different types of filters. Some are "twist-in" filters. They sit inside the top right corner of the fridge. Others are "push-in" filters. These often go in the grille at the bottom front. Still others are behind a removable panel inside the fridge. Knowing your filter location helps confirm the type. Always verify the model number before purchasing. This ensures a perfect fit and proper filtration. Remember, genuine Kenmore parts or certified compatible filters work best.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Changing Your Kenmore Refrigerator Water Filter

Changing your Kenmore refrigerator water filter is a simple process. It usually takes only a few minutes. The exact steps vary slightly depending on your filter's location and type. I will guide you through the common methods.

### Preparing for the Change

Before you start, gather a few items. You will need your new Kenmore water filter. Have a small towel or cloth ready. A shallow pan or bowl can also be helpful. This will catch any drips. Most filter changes do not require tools. You might want to have your owner's manual handy. It can provide specific details for your model.

### Changing a Twist-In Filter (Top Right Corner)

Many Kenmore models have a twist-in filter. It is often located in the top right corner of the fresh food compartment.

1.  **Locate the filter:** Open your refrigerator door. Look in the upper right section. You will see a small, cylindrical cap. This is the filter housing.
2.  **Twist to remove:** Grasp the cap firmly. Twist it counter-clockwise about a quarter turn. You might hear a small hiss. This is normal. It is just the water pressure releasing.
3.  **Pull straight out:** Once twisted, pull the old filter straight out. Be prepared for a few drops of water. Use your towel to catch them.
4.  **Insert the new filter:** Remove the protective cap from the new filter. Align the new filter with the housing. Push it straight in until it stops.
5.  **Twist to lock:** Twist the new filter clockwise about a quarter turn. You should feel it lock into place. The arrow on the filter should align with the lock symbol on the housing.
6.  **Flush the system:** Dispense 2-3 gallons of water through the dispenser. This purges air and carbon fines from the new filter. The water may look cloudy or discolored at first. This is normal. Keep flushing until it runs clear.

This method is common for many Kenmore models. For more specific instructions on particular models, you can refer to resources like [how to change Kenmore refrigerator water filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-kenmore-refrigerator-water-filter) or even [how to change water filter on Kenmore bottom freezer refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-water-filter-on-kenmore-bottom-freezer-refrigerator).

### Changing a Push-In Filter (Base Grille)

Some Kenmore models have a push-in filter. This filter is often located in the base grille at the bottom front of the refrigerator.

1.  **Locate the filter:** Open the freezer door or remove the base grille cover. The filter usually has a push-button release.
2.  **Press the button:** Push the release button next to the filter. The filter should pop out slightly.
3.  **Pull straight out:** Grasp the filter and pull it straight out. Again, be ready for a few drips of water.
4.  **Insert the new filter:** Remove the cap from the new filter. Align the new filter. Push it firmly into the housing until it clicks into place. Make sure it seats fully.
5.  **Flush the system:** Dispense 2-3 gallons of water through the dispenser. This flushes out any air or carbon particles. Continue flushing until the water runs clear.

### Changing a Behind-Panel Filter (Inside Fridge)

Less common but still present are filters behind a panel inside the fridge.

1.  **Locate the panel:** Find the panel, often on the back wall or side.
2.  **Open the panel:** Release the latch or unclip the panel to open it.
3.  **Twist/Push to remove:** Follow the instructions for twist-in or push-in removal, as applicable.
4.  **Insert new filter:** Place the new filter into the housing. Ensure it is secure.
5.  **Close the panel:** Close and secure the access panel.
6.  **Flush the system:** Dispense 2-3 gallons of water.

Remember to follow your specific model's instructions. If you own a Kenmore refrigerator model 253, you can find a dedicated guide on [how to change water filter on Kenmore refrigerator model 253](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-water-filter-on-kenmore-refrigerator-model-253). Always flush the system thoroughly after any water filter change. This prepares the filter for optimal use.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Changing Your Kenmore Refrigerator Air Filter

Changing the air filter in your Kenmore refrigerator is even simpler than the water filter. It usually requires no tools. This quick task helps keep your food fresh and prevents odors.

### Locating the Air Filter

First, you need to find your air filter. Kenmore refrigerator air filters are typically located in one of two places:

*   **Near the top of the fresh food compartment:** Look for a rectangular housing or a small louvered vent. It is often on the back wall or side wall near the top.
*   **Inside a dedicated filter compartment:** Some models have a small, easily accessible compartment, sometimes labeled "PureAir" or similar.

Refer to your Kenmore owner's manual if you cannot find it. The manual provides the exact location for your specific model.

### Steps to Replace the Air Filter

Once you have located the air filter, follow these easy steps:

1.  **Open the filter housing:**
    *   For filters within a housing, you usually press a tab or squeeze clips to open the cover.
    *   If it is a simple slot, you might just pull it out.
2.  **Remove the old filter:**
    *   Carefully pull the old air filter out of its slot or compartment. It might look like a small, flat cartridge.
    *   Note how the filter is oriented. There might be an arrow indicating airflow direction.
3.  **Insert the new filter:**
    *   Unwrap your new Kenmore air filter.
    *   Align the new filter correctly. Make sure any arrows match the direction shown on the housing.
    *   Slide or push the new filter firmly into place.
4.  **Close the filter housing:**
    *   Snap the cover back into place. Ensure it is secure.
5.  **Reset the indicator (if applicable):**
    *   Some Kenmore models have an air filter indicator light. If yours does, you might need to press and hold a "Filter Reset" button for a few seconds. This is often on the control panel.
    *   If there is no light, there is nothing more to do.

Changing your Kenmore air filter periodically ensures your refrigerator maintains a fresh environment. This helps your fruits and vegetables last longer. It also stops odors from mixing. Do not underestimate the power of a fresh air filter for overall food quality.

## Resetting Your Kenmore Refrigerator Filter Light

After changing your Kenmore refrigerator filter, the "Change Filter" or "Filter Status" light might stay on. This is normal. The light does not automatically detect the new filter. You need to manually reset it. Resetting the filter light is a crucial step. It tells your refrigerator's internal system that a fresh filter is in place. It also restarts the timer for the next replacement cycle.

Ignoring the reset can lead to confusion. You might think your filter is still old. This can make you change it too early. Or, if you forget when you actually changed it, you might miss the next replacement. Always reset the light to ensure accurate tracking.

Most Kenmore refrigerators use a similar method to reset the filter light. The exact button or sequence may vary slightly by model. Here are the common methods:

*   **Press and Hold a Specific Button:**
    *   Look for a button labeled "Filter," "Reset Filter," "Water Filter," or "Options" on your refrigerator's control panel.
    *   Press and hold this button for about 3 to 5 seconds.
    *   The light should turn off or change color (e.g., from red/orange to green/blue). You might hear a beep.
*   **Combination of Buttons:**
    *   Some models require pressing two buttons simultaneously. This might be "Light" and "Ice Maker Lock" or similar combinations. Check your owner's manual for specific instructions.
*   **Dispense Water:**
    *   For some older Kenmore models, dispensing a certain amount of water after the change can reset the light. This is less common but worth checking if other methods fail.

If you are having trouble finding the reset button or the light does not turn off, consult your Kenmore owner's manual. The manual provides specific instructions for your refrigerator model. Keep in mind that for many Kenmore models, you can find detailed steps on [how to reset Kenmore refrigerator water filter light](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-kenmore-refrigerator-water-filter-light). Resetting the light ensures your refrigerator tracks filter life accurately. It helps you remember when the next filter change is due.

## Troubleshooting Common Kenmore Filter Change Issues

Even with clear instructions, you might encounter small issues. Do not worry. Most Kenmore filter change problems have simple solutions. I will cover the most common ones here.

### Issue 1: Water Leaks After Filter Change

A common concern after changing a water filter is leaking. This usually happens for one of a few reasons:

*   **Improperly seated filter:** The new filter might not be pushed or twisted fully into place. Remove the filter and reinsert it. Make sure it clicks or locks securely.
*   **Missing or damaged O-rings:** Filters have rubber O-rings. These create a seal. If an O-ring is missing, twisted, or damaged, water can leak. Check the new filter for intact O-rings. Ensure they are properly seated.
*   **Incorrect filter type:** Using a filter not specifically designed for your Kenmore model can cause poor fit. Double-check your filter's model number against your refrigerator's requirements.

If a leak persists, turn off the water supply to the refrigerator immediately. This prevents water damage. Then, re-examine the filter installation carefully.

### Issue 2: Slow Water Flow or No Water After Change

If water flows slowly or not at all, consider these possibilities:

*   **Air in the system:** After a filter change, air can get trapped in the water lines. This is common. Dispense several gallons of water continuously. This flushes out the air. The flow should improve.
*   **New filter not fully opened:** Some filters have a small valve that opens when installed. Ensure the filter is fully seated.
*   **Water supply valve:** Check that the water supply valve to your refrigerator is fully open. It might have been accidentally bumped.
*   **Kinked water line:** Inspect the water line behind the refrigerator. A kink can restrict water flow.

Flushing the filter is often the solution for slow flow. Be patient and dispense water until it flows steadily.

### Issue 3: Filter Light Won't Reset

If you have tried to reset the light but it remains on, here are some steps:

*   **Correct button and timing:** Are you pressing the correct button for the required duration? Some models need a continuous hold for 5-10 seconds. Refer to your manual.
*   **Repeated attempts:** Sometimes, it takes a few tries. Press and hold, release, and then try again.
*   **Power cycle:** Unplug the refrigerator from the wall outlet for 5 minutes. Then plug it back in. This can sometimes reset the control panel.
*   **Control panel issue:** Rarely, the control panel itself might have a malfunction. If nothing else works, you might need to consult a technician.

Most filter change issues are minor and easily fixed. Following these troubleshooting steps will help you quickly resolve common problems. If you are ever unsure, contacting Kenmore customer support or a qualified appliance technician is always a good option.
