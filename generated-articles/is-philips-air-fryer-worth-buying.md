They are not appliances you can easily tuck away in a cupboard after every use. Measure your available kitchen counter and storage space. Ensure the air fryer fits comfortably. A large unit can dominate a small kitchen.

#### Learning Curve for New Users

#### Can I put water in my Philips Air Fryer for steam cooking?
No, you should not put water directly into the main cooking basket or pan of a Philips Air Fryer for steam cooking. Air fryers are designed for hot air circulation, not steam.
