## Maximizing Battery Life and Performance After Wiring

Wiring your Ring Doorbell Plus significantly extends its battery life. However, you can take further steps to maximize its performance. These actions help ensure your doorbell stays charged and responsive. I have found these tips very helpful in my own setup.

First, optimize your motion settings. The Ring Doorbell Plus uses power to detect motion and record videos. If your doorbell captures many unnecessary events, it will drain the battery faster. Adjust your motion zones. Focus them on areas where you expect visitors. Reduce the sensitivity if you get alerts from cars or pets on the street. Use the "People Only" mode if available. This reduces recordings of non-human motion. Fewer recordings mean less power usage.

Second, ensure strong Wi-Fi signal strength. A poor Wi-Fi connection makes the doorbell work harder to send data. This increased effort consumes more battery power. Check your doorbell's signal strength in the Ring app. If it is low, consider moving your Wi-Fi router closer. A Wi-Fi extender or mesh system can also boost the signal at your door. A stable connection ensures efficient power use.

Third, adjust video quality settings. Higher video quality uses more power for processing and uploading. If battery life is a top priority, consider slightly lowering the video resolution in the Ring app. You can find these options in the device settings. While high resolution is great, a slightly lower setting can still provide clear images. It will also help conserve battery life.

Fourth, limit Live View sessions. Accessing the Live View feature frequently drains the battery. Each time you stream video, the doorbell actively uses power. Try to use Live View only when necessary. If you check it constantly, the trickle charge might struggle to keep up. I use Live View mostly when I get an alert.

Finally, review your chime settings. If you use the in-app chime notifications, ensure they are set up correctly. The wired connection allows your existing indoor chime to ring. Make sure this is properly configured in the app. Incorrect settings can sometimes cause power inefficiencies or prevent the chime from working as expected. These steps combine with wiring to give you a truly low-maintenance smart doorbell experience.
