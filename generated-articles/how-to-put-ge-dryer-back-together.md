To put your GE dryer back together, you must reinstall components in reverse order of removal. Start with the internal drum and support parts, then electrical connections, followed by outer panels and the control console. Ensure all screws and wires connect properly for safe operation.

## Preparing to Reassemble Your GE Dryer

Putting a GE dryer back together needs careful work. Before you pick up any dryer part, you must prepare your workspace. Preparation makes the job easier and safer. It also prevents errors that could cause problems later.

First, always ensure the dryer is unplugged from the wall outlet. This step is critical for your safety. Working with electricity is risky if power remains on. Next, clear a large area around the dryer. You need room to move parts and use tools. Place smaller parts and screws in separate containers. This keeps them organized and easy to find when needed.

Gather all your tools. You will likely need screwdrivers (Phillips and flathead), nut drivers, pliers, and possibly a multimeter for testing connections. Look at the parts you removed. If you marked wires or took photos during disassembly, have those handy. This helps ensure everything goes back in its correct spot. I always take pictures with my phone as I take things apart; it saves a lot of guesswork later. If you removed your back panel for access, you might have followed steps in our guide on [how to remove GE dryer back panel](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-ge-dryer-back-panel). Having a clean workspace and all tools ready truly sets you up for success.

## Installing the Dryer Drum and Support Components

The dryer drum is the biggest part inside your GE dryer. Putting it back in place is a main step. The drum needs support to spin smoothly. This support comes from rollers and an idler pulley. These parts help the belt move the drum.

First, make sure the rear drum bearing is secure. This bearing sits at the back of the drum. It allows the drum to spin freely. Often, it just slides into a slot on the dryer's back wall. Next, place the drum rollers. Most GE dryers have two rollers at the front and two at the back. These rollers hold the drum up. Make sure they spin freely on their shafts. If your rollers feel stiff or make noise, consider replacing them now. This prevents future [dryer not spinning issues](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ge-dryer-not-spinning).

With the rollers in place, you can carefully position the drum. Slide the drum onto the rear bearing and align it with the front rollers. Now comes the drive belt. The belt goes around the drum and then around the motor pulley and idler pulley. Route the belt around the drum first. The grooved side of the belt should face the drum. Then, loop the belt correctly around the idler pulley and the motor shaft. The idler pulley keeps tension on the belt. Proper belt tension is key for the dryer to spin clothes. Check the belt's path again to ensure it sits correctly on all pulleys. If the belt is old or frayed, it is a good idea to install a new one.

## Connecting Electrical Components and Sensors

With the drum and its supports in place, you need to connect the electrical parts. These parts control heating, temperature, and safety. GE dryers have several sensors and heating elements that need correct wiring. Improper connections can cause your dryer to [not heat up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-dryer-not-heat-up) or create safety risks.

Start with the heating element. It usually sits in a housing at the back or bottom of the dryer. If you removed it, carefully slide it back into its slot. Secure it with any screws or clips it had. Then, reconnect its wires. These wires often have specific terminals; match them carefully. If you forgot which wire goes where, refer to any photos you took or the wiring diagram, usually found on the back of the dryer or inside the control panel.

Next, reconnect the safety sensors. These include thermostats and thermal fuses. Thermostats control temperature, while thermal fuses act as safety cut-offs if the dryer gets too hot. They often attach to the heating element housing or air duct. Reattach them using their screws or clips. Then, plug their wires back in. Each sensor typically has two wires. Ensure these connections are tight. A loose connection can cause the dryer to [not get hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ge-dryer-not-getting-hot) or [run but produce no heat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-dryer-run-but-no-heat). Also, make sure all wire harnesses are tucked away safely. They should not touch moving parts like the drum or belt. This prevents damage and ensures reliable operation. Take your time with this step. Electrical safety is very important.

## Securing the Front Bulkhead and Panels

After installing the drum and reconnecting internal electrical components, the next step is to secure the front bulkhead. The front bulkhead is a crucial structural part. It holds the front of the dryer drum and provides the frame for the lint filter housing. Getting this part right ensures the drum spins smoothly and the lint filter works.

Carefully align the front bulkhead with the dryer chassis. It usually slots into place at the bottom and has screw points along the sides. Make sure the front drum rollers, which are typically part of this bulkhead, line up with the drum's front lip. Once aligned, secure it with the screws you removed earlier. Do not overtighten, but ensure it is firm. The lint filter housing is usually integrated into the front bulkhead. Ensure it is clean and clear. If you did a deep clean, this area should be spotless. You can find tips for this in guides like [how to clean lint in GE dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lint-in-ge-dryer).

Next, you will reattach the front panel of the dryer. This panel forms the front exterior of the machine. It attaches to the front bulkhead and the main dryer frame. Lift the front panel and hook its bottom clips into the slots at the base of the dryer. Then, push the top of the panel flush against the frame. Secure it with the screws that run along the top and sides, usually located inside the door opening or along the top edge of the dryer. Ensure all wires that pass through the front panel (e.g., for the door switch) are routed correctly and not pinched. This step brings the dryer closer to its final form.

## Reattaching the Control Panel and Door

With the main body of your GE dryer reassembled, it is time to focus on the control panel and the door. These parts are essential for operating your dryer and loading clothes. Getting them attached correctly ensures your dryer looks complete and functions as expected.

First, handle the control panel. This panel holds all the buttons, knobs, and display. It also contains the main control board. Carefully position the control panel onto the top of the dryer. It usually has clips or tabs that fit into slots on the dryer's top frame. Once aligned, secure it with screws, often located at the back or inside the console itself. Before fully securing it, reconnect all wire harnesses to the control board. Each wire harness usually has a unique connector, making it hard to connect incorrectly. However, double-check any specific wire connections if you marked them during disassembly. If you previously needed to [take off a GE dryer knob](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-take-ge-dryer-knob-off), now is the time to put it back on. Push the knobs firmly onto their shafts.

Now, attach the dryer door. The door typically mounts to the front panel with hinges. Position the door hinges into their slots on the front panel. Then, secure them with the screws you removed. Ensure the door opens and closes smoothly. Also, reconnect any wires to the door switch. This switch tells the dryer when the door is closed, allowing it to start. Test the door latch by closing the door. It should click firmly into place. If you ever considered changing the door swing, you might have followed steps like [how to switch door on GE dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-switch-door-on-ge-dryer). Ensure all connections are secure for both the control panel and the door. This ensures safety and proper functionality when you power on the unit.

## Final Checks and Testing Your GE Dryer

You are almost done! After putting all the parts back, doing final checks is very important. This ensures your GE dryer runs safely and correctly. Do not skip this step. It prevents future problems and confirms your hard work paid off.

First, look over the entire dryer. Are all screws in place? Are all panels secure? Gently shake the dryer to see if anything wobbles. If you find loose parts, secure them now. Next, double-check all electrical connections. Ensure every wire connects firmly to its correct terminal. No wires should be pinched or touching moving parts. Open the dryer door and ensure the lint filter is clean and properly seated. A dirty filter can make your dryer [take too long to dry clothes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-dryer-take-so-long-to-dry).

Now, slide the dryer back into its position. Make sure it is level. Use a level tool if you have one. Adjust the leveling feet at the bottom if needed. A level dryer runs more quietly and efficiently. Next, plug the dryer back into the wall outlet. Turn the power on. Listen for any unusual sounds. If you hear grinding or thumping, unplug it immediately. This might mean the belt is not routed correctly or a part is rubbing. Run a short cycle, like "air fluff" with no heat, first. Listen for strange noises or vibrations. Then, run a heated cycle. Feel the air coming from the vent. It should be warm. Check the lint trap during and after the cycle. If everything seems normal, you have successfully reassembled your GE dryer!
