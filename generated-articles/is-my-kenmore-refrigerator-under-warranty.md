### Clear and Concise Answer

Your Kenmore refrigerator's warranty status depends on its purchase date, model, and any extended coverage. Most new Kenmore refrigerators come with a one-year limited warranty. You must find your refrigerator's model and serial numbers to check current coverage. Then you can contact Kenmore or the retailer for verification.

## Understanding Kenmore Refrigerator Warranty Basics

Kenmore refrigerators are known for being reliable appliances. Still, like any machine, they can experience problems. When something goes wrong, a warranty can protect you from high repair costs. Knowing the specifics of your Kenmore refrigerator warranty is important. It helps you understand your rights as a consumer.

Most new Kenmore refrigerators come with a standard limited warranty. This warranty usually covers parts and labor for defects in materials or workmanship. The typical duration for this standard warranty is one year from the date of purchase. Some specific components might have longer coverage, like the compressor. Always check your specific warranty document for precise details.

Kenmore does not manufacture its own appliances. Different companies produce Kenmore products. For example, Whirlpool often makes Kenmore refrigerators. This fact can influence how warranties are handled. Knowing the actual manufacturer may help sometimes, but Kenmore handles most warranty claims directly.

You received a warranty booklet or card with your refrigerator. This document explains everything about your coverage. It lists what is covered, what is excluded, and how long the warranty lasts. Keep this document in a safe place. I always advise storing important appliance papers together.

If you bought your Kenmore refrigerator from a retailer like Sears, they might offer their own extended warranty. These are separate from the manufacturer's warranty. We will discuss extended warranties more later in this article.

## How to Find Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model and Serial Number

Before you can check your Kenmore refrigerator's warranty, you need its identifying information. The model number and serial number are critical. These numbers tell the manufacturer exactly which unit you own. They also help determine the age and production details of your specific appliance.

The most common place to find this information is inside the refrigerator. Look on the interior walls or ceiling of the fresh food compartment. Sometimes, the label is on the side wall or near the top. You might find it near the crisper drawers. The location can vary slightly by model.

Another common spot is on the door frame when the door is open. Check along the edges where the door seals. For bottom-freezer models, the label might be inside the freezer compartment. Some labels are behind the kick plate at the bottom front of the refrigerator. This area is often overlooked.

The label typically has "Model No." and "Serial No." clearly marked. It might also show other details, like manufacturing date. Write down these numbers carefully. Double-check for accuracy before you call for support. Even one wrong digit can cause confusion.

Knowing your specific Kenmore model number also helps with general troubleshooting. You can look up common issues for your exact model. This can be useful even if your warranty has expired. For example, if you need to know [how to tell which Kenmore refrigerator I have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-which-kenmore-refrigerator-i-have), finding these numbers is the first step. This information is your key to accessing Kenmore support.

## Checking Your Kenmore Refrigerator Warranty Status

Once you have your Kenmore refrigerator's model and serial numbers, checking the warranty status is next. Several methods are available. Choose the one that is most convenient for you. This step helps confirm if your appliance is still covered.

The most direct method is to contact Kenmore customer service. You can find their contact information on the Kenmore website or in your owner's manual. When you call, have your model and serial numbers ready. They will ask for your purchase date and possibly the retailer name. The representative can then look up your warranty information.

If you bought your Kenmore refrigerator from Sears, you might check their records. Sears often keeps purchase history. They can usually confirm your warranty status. This is especially true if you purchased an extended service plan from them. They have a specific appliance support line.

Some manufacturers offer online warranty check tools. You enter your model and serial number on their website. The tool then tells you if your product is under warranty. Check the official Kenmore support website for such a feature. Not all brands have this, but it is worth checking.

You should also check your original purchase receipt. This document often shows the purchase date clearly. The warranty starts from this date. If you have an extended warranty, it will also be noted on your sales receipt or a separate contract. Keep all these documents handy. They are your proof of purchase and coverage.

Remember that a standard limited warranty usually lasts one year. If your refrigerator is older than one year, it might only be under an extended warranty. You might be asking [is my GE refrigerator under warranty](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-my-ge-refrigerator-under-warranty) or [is my LG refrigerator still under warranty](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-my-lg-refrigerator-still-under-warranty) for other appliances. The process is similar across brands. Always verify directly with the manufacturer or seller.

## What Your Kenmore Refrigerator Warranty Covers (and Doesn't)

Understanding the scope of your Kenmore refrigerator warranty prevents surprises. A warranty covers specific types of defects. It does not cover everything that could possibly go wrong. Knowing these limits helps manage expectations.

Generally, a Kenmore limited warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship. This means if a part fails because it was poorly made, the warranty covers it. For example, if a compressor stops working due to a manufacturing flaw, it would be covered. This includes both parts and the labor to replace them during the primary warranty period.

However, warranties typically do not cover damage from misuse or neglect. If you accidentally damage your refrigerator, the warranty will not cover repairs. This includes damage from dropping items inside or improper installation. Power surges or natural disasters are also usually excluded. These are often covered by home insurance, not appliance warranties.

Normal wear and tear items are not covered either. Filters are a good example. Your warranty will not cover the cost of new water filters. You are responsible for regular maintenance. This includes tasks like [how to change filter in Kenmore refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-filter-in-kenmore-refrigerator) or [how to clean coils under Kenmore refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-coils-under-kenmore-refrigerator). Failing to perform these tasks can sometimes even void part of your warranty.

Any repairs done by unauthorized service technicians can also void your warranty. Always use Kenmore-authorized service providers. This ensures the repair work meets their standards. It also keeps your coverage valid. Always read the fine print of your specific warranty document.

## Extending Your Kenmore Refrigerator's Coverage

A standard one-year warranty on your Kenmore refrigerator might not feel long enough. Appliances are a significant investment. You want to protect them for as long as possible. Extended warranty plans offer additional peace of mind. They cover your appliance beyond the manufacturer's limited warranty.

Extended warranties, also called service plans or protection plans, cover future repairs. They usually begin after the manufacturer's warranty expires. These plans can cover parts and labor for several years. They often cover issues that arise from normal use. This means you do not pay for unexpected breakdowns.

You can often purchase an extended warranty when you buy the refrigerator. Retailers like Sears traditionally offered their own protection plans for Kenmore appliances. These plans vary in length and coverage. Some plans offer three or five years of additional coverage. They sometimes include perks like annual check-ups or food loss reimbursement.

It is also possible to buy an extended warranty later. Some third-party companies offer appliance protection plans. Before buying from a third-party, research their reputation carefully. Make sure they are reliable and have good customer service. I always recommend comparing options.

Consider the cost of the extended warranty against potential repair costs. For a major appliance like a refrigerator, repairs can be expensive. A compressor replacement can cost hundreds of dollars. An extended warranty might be a wise investment if you plan to keep your refrigerator for many years. It gives you protection beyond the initial Kenmore refrigerator warranty.

## Filing a Kenmore Refrigerator Warranty Claim: Step-by-Step

If your Kenmore refrigerator breaks down and you believe it is still under warranty, you need to file a claim. The process is straightforward. Following the correct steps ensures your claim is processed smoothly. I will guide you through each stage.

First, gather all necessary information. You need your Kenmore refrigerator's model number and serial number. Your original purchase receipt is also essential. This receipt proves the date of purchase. It is your proof of active warranty coverage. Write down the specific problem your refrigerator is having. Be detailed and clear. For example, "my refrigerator is not cooling" or "the ice maker stopped working." This helps the service technician diagnose the problem quickly.

Next, contact Kenmore customer service or the retailer where you bought the appliance. Explain the issue clearly. Provide them with the model and serial numbers, and your purchase date. They will verify your warranty status. If your refrigerator is still under warranty, they will arrange for a service appointment.

A Kenmore-authorized service technician will then visit your home. They will inspect the refrigerator and diagnose the problem. If the issue is covered under warranty, the technician will repair or replace the faulty part. There should be no charge for parts or labor for covered repairs. Always confirm this with the technician before work begins.

If the technician finds the problem is not covered, they will explain why. They will usually provide an estimate for the repair cost. At this point, you can decide whether to proceed with the out-of-warranty repair. Sometimes, a problem like [why is my Kenmore refrigerator not cold enough](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-refrigerator-not-cold-enough) might have a simple fix not covered by warranty, like dirty coils.

Keep records of all communication. This includes dates of calls, names of representatives, and service ticket numbers. These records are helpful if any issues arise with your claim. A detailed log helps ensure a smooth repair process.

## When Your Kenmore Refrigerator Is No Longer Under Warranty
