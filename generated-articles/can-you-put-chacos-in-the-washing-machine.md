## Washing Chacos: Can They Go in the Machine?

You love your Chacos. They are with you on every adventure. From river trails to city streets, they handle dirt and sweat. But after many miles, your sandals probably need a good clean. A common question arises for many Chaco owners: **Can you put Chacos in the washing machine?** This question is important for keeping your favorite sandals clean and fresh.

Keeping Chacos clean extends their life. It also keeps them hygienic for your feet. In this article, we will explore the best ways to clean your Chacos. We will discuss machine washing safety. We will also cover effective hand washing methods. You will learn how to keep your Chacos looking and feeling great.

### Takeaway:

*   Machine washing Chacos is possible with careful steps.
*   Always use a gentle cycle with cold water.
*   Hand washing is generally safer and often more effective.
*   Air drying is the only safe drying method for Chacos.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and hot temperatures.

Yes, you can put Chacos in the washing machine, but you must follow specific precautions. Use a gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. Placing them in a mesh laundry bag protects both your sandals and the machine. Hand washing is often a gentler, preferred method for long-term care.

### The Truth About Washing Chacos in a Machine

Many Chaco owners wonder about machine washing their sandals. Chacos are durable, built for tough conditions. This durability makes people think they can withstand a washing machine cycle. The brand itself often recommends hand washing. However, machine washing is a common practice for many.

Using a washing machine can be convenient. It saves time and effort compared to hand scrubbing. But it comes with risks. The harshness of a machine cycle might damage straps or glues. It is important to understand these risks before you start. You need to protect your investment.

My experience tells me that machine washing is okay if done correctly. I have put my own Chacos through the wash several times. They came out looking much better. The key is to be gentle. Think of it as a delicate operation.

Proper Chaco care prevents early wear and tear. Whether you choose machine or hand washing, the goal is to clean them effectively. It also prevents damage. We will guide you through the best practices. This ensures your Chacos stay ready for your next journey.

### Machine Washing Chacos: Your Step-by-Step Guide

If you choose to machine wash your Chacos, follow these steps carefully. This method aims to minimize any potential damage. Always prioritize the longevity of your sandals. These steps make the process safe and effective.

First, prepare your Chacos. Remove any large debris like mud or pebbles. A quick rinse under a faucet helps. This prevents excess dirt from entering your washing machine. I often use an old toothbrush for stubborn spots.

Next, place your Chacos into a mesh laundry bag. This bag protects the sandals from banging around. It also keeps straps from getting tangled. It is an important step to prevent damage. This also protects the inside of your washing machine drum.

Set your washing machine to the correct settings. Use the gentle or delicate cycle. Always use cold water. Hot water can degrade the glue and materials. Add a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach. Think about [how full should a washing machine be](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-should-a-washing-machine-be) before you start. Overloading can reduce cleaning effectiveness. It can also stress your machine.

Once the cycle finishes, remove your Chacos promptly. Do not put them in the dryer. We will discuss safe drying methods later. This careful approach helps your Chacos come out clean and intact.

### Hand Washing Chacos for the Best Results

Hand washing is the safest and often most recommended method for cleaning Chacos. It gives you direct control over the cleaning process. This helps prevent damage that a machine might cause. I find it to be a very therapeutic process. It is a good way to give your Chacos a thorough clean.

Start with a bucket or a sink filled with lukewarm water. Add a small amount of mild soap. Dish soap works well, or a gentle laundry detergent. Avoid harsh soaps that can dry out or damage materials. Mix the water and soap until suds form.

Submerge your Chacos in the soapy water. Let them soak for about 15-30 minutes. This helps loosen dirt and grime. For very dirty Chacos, you might need a longer soak. I sometimes leave mine overnight if they are really caked with mud.

After soaking, use a stiff brush to scrub the footbeds and soles. An old toothbrush is perfect for getting into crevices. Pay extra attention to the textured areas of the footbed. This is where most dirt and sweat accumulate. The straps also need a good scrub. You can run the straps through your fingers to work out dirt.

Rinse your Chacos thoroughly under clean running water. Make sure all soap residue is gone. Soap left behind can attract more dirt. It can also irritate your skin. A complete rinse is crucial for clean, fresh-smelling Chacos.

### Tackling Common Stains and Odors on Chacos

Chacos face many challenges, from mud to unpleasant smells. Addressing these specific issues needs targeted solutions. Simply washing them might not remove every stain or odor. We need a few tricks up our sleeves.

Footbed odors are very common. They come from sweat and bacteria. For this, baking soda is your friend. After a general wash, sprinkle baking soda generously on the wet footbeds. Let it sit overnight. The baking soda absorbs odors. Rinse it off in the morning. Vinegar also works as a natural deodorizer. A 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water can be sprayed on the footbeds. Let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing.

Stains require spot treatment. For mud or dirt stains, a scrub brush with soap and water usually works. Grease or oil stains can be tougher. Apply a small amount of dish soap directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then scrub gently. Rinse thoroughly afterward. Always test any stain remover in an inconspicuous area first. This prevents damage to your sandals.

Mold and mildew can appear if Chacos stay wet for too long. A diluted bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) can kill mildew. Apply it carefully with a cloth or brush. Rinse immediately and very well. For a bleach-free option, use a stronger vinegar solution. Ensure good ventilation when drying. Prompt drying after every wash or wet adventure is key.

### Drying Chacos Safely After Their Wash

After cleaning your Chacos, proper drying is critical. This step ensures your sandals last longer. Incorrect drying methods can cause irreparable damage. My rule of thumb is "no heat ever." High temperatures are the enemy of Chaco materials.

Always air dry your Chacos. Find a shaded, well-ventilated area. Direct sunlight for extended periods can fade colors. It can also degrade the rubber and plastic components over time. Place them where air can circulate around them. This speeds up the drying process.

Never put Chacos in a clothes dryer. The heat from a dryer can melt the adhesives. It can warp the straps and footbeds. This will ruin the fit and comfort of your sandals. A dryer can also shrink the straps. This makes them unusable. I have heard stories of people doing this, and it never ends well.

To speed up drying, you can use a towel. Blot excess water from the straps and footbed. This removes a lot of moisture quickly. You can also place them in front of a fan. Just make sure the fan is not blowing hot air. Hang them by their straps if possible. This allows maximum airflow.

Allow your Chacos to dry completely before wearing them again. Wearing damp Chacos can lead to new odors or mildew growth. Depending on humidity, drying can take 12 to 24 hours. Patience is a virtue here.

### Extend Chaco Life: More Than Just Cleaning

Cleaning is vital for Chaco maintenance. But extending their life involves more than just washing. Regular care and smart habits keep your sandals in top condition. This means your Chacos will serve you for many more adventures. I always think of my Chacos as an investment. They deserve good care.

After every use, especially after wet or muddy activities, a quick rinse helps. This prevents dirt from drying and hardening. It makes deep cleaning easier later on. Simple habits go a long way. This is similar to how you care for other items that endure wear and tear. For example, considering [how full should a washing machine be](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-should-a-washing machine-be) for clothes ensures effective cleaning without damage.

Store your Chacos properly. When not in use, keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or hot cars. Extreme heat can degrade the materials over time. Hanging them up or placing them in a shoe rack works well. This prevents them from getting squashed or bent.

Address minor issues promptly. If a strap starts to fray, trim loose threads carefully. If the buckle feels stiff, a tiny bit of silicone spray can help. Don't let small problems become big ones. Chaco offers repair services for major issues. This can be a cost-effective way to extend their life further.

Regularly check the soles for wear. If the treads wear down significantly, traction decreases. This makes them less safe on slippery surfaces. Knowing when to replace or repair soles is part of responsible Chaco ownership. This helps you get the most out of your sandals.

### Chaco Cleaning Don'ts: What to Avoid

When cleaning your Chacos, knowing what *not* to do is as important as knowing what to do. Certain actions can damage your sandals irreparably. Avoiding these mistakes ensures your Chacos stay in great shape for years. I have learned some of these lessons the hard way.

First, never use hot water for washing. Whether by hand or machine, hot water can cause the glues to weaken. It can also warp the footbed material. Always stick to cold or lukewarm water. This preserves the integrity of your sandals.

Avoid harsh chemicals. Bleach should be used with extreme caution, and only when necessary for mold or mildew. Dilute it heavily. Never use industrial cleaners, abrasive powders, or strong solvents. These can strip the color, degrade the material, or leave residues that irritate your skin. A mild soap is almost always sufficient.

Do not put your Chacos in a dryer. This is perhaps the biggest "don't." The intense heat will melt glues, shrink straps, and warp the footbed. This will destroy your Chacos beyond repair. Always air dry them completely. This maintains their shape and function.

Stay away from abrasive scrubbing on sensitive areas. While the footbed and soles can handle tough scrubbing, be gentler on the straps and logos. Excessive force can cause fraying or wear down important details. Use a softer brush or cloth for these parts.

Finally, do not wear them before they are completely dry. Damp Chacos are a breeding ground for bacteria and mildew. This leads to unpleasant odors and can damage the material over time. Ensure they are bone dry before slipping them back on.
