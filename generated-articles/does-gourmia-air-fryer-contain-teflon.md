## The Science Behind PTFE and PFOA in Cookware

PTFE, or Polytetrafluoroethylene, is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene. It is famous for its non-stick properties. It has a very low coefficient of friction. This means food does not stick to it easily. PTFE is also heat-resistant and chemically inert at typical cooking temperatures. This makes it ideal for cookware. Its discovery in 1938 led to widespread use in many industries, including kitchenware.

For many years, PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) was a processing aid used to make PTFE coatings. PFOA helped in the polymerization process. It would burn off during high-temperature manufacturing. However, small amounts could remain or be released into the environment. Concerns grew about PFOA's persistence in the environment and its potential health effects. Studies suggested links to certain health issues in humans and animals. This led to global efforts to eliminate its use.

The good news is that PFOA is no longer used in the production of non-stick cookware in the United States and many other countries. Manufacturers, including Gourmia, use alternative processing aids that do not contain PFOA. This change makes modern non-stick coatings significantly safer. When a product says "PFOA-free," it means this concerning chemical was not used during its manufacturing. This ensures that while the non-stick surface is still PTFE-based, it adheres to higher safety standards. You can feel more secure knowing your Gourmia air fryer is made without PFOA. This development marked a major step forward for consumer safety.
