Two common culprits for a dryer not working are the thermal fuse and the door switch. These parts are crucial for the dryer's operation and safety. Understanding their function and how to check them can help diagnose issues.

#### The Thermal Fuse

The thermal fuse is a safety device. It is designed to protect your dryer from overheating. If the dryer gets too hot, the fuse blows. This cuts off power to the heating element or the entire dryer. A blown thermal fuse means the dryer will not start or heat. This is often a sign of airflow restriction. A clogged lint screen or blocked dryer vent can cause overheating.

To check the thermal fuse:
1.  **Disconnect Power:** Always unplug your dryer from the wall outlet. Safety is paramount.
2.  **Locate the Fuse:** The thermal fuse is usually located on the blower housing or heating element housing. It is a small, white component with two wires attached. You might need to remove the back panel of your dryer to access it.
3.  **Test for Continuity:** You will need a multimeter for this step. Set the multimeter to the continuity setting. Touch one probe to each terminal of the thermal fuse. If the fuse is good, the multimeter will beep or show a reading of zero or near-zero ohms. If it shows no continuity (no beep or an "OL" reading), the fuse is blown.
4.  **Replace if Blown:** If the thermal fuse is blown, it needs replacement. You cannot reset a blown thermal fuse. It is a one-time safety device. When replacing it, ensure you clear any vent blockages. A new fuse will blow again if the underlying overheating issue is not fixed. A good resource for this is [how to reset a Whirlpool dryer thermal fuse](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-whirlpool-dryer-thermal-fuse). This guide provides detailed steps.

#### The Door Switch

The door switch is another safety component. It prevents the dryer from operating when the door is open. If the door switch is faulty, the dryer will not start. It will act as if the door is still open. Even if you close the door, the dryer's control panel might not register it.

To check the door switch:
1.  **Disconnect Power:** Again, unplug the dryer before any inspection.
2.  **Locate the Switch:** The door switch is usually mounted inside the dryer's front panel, near the door opening. You might see a small plunger or lever that the door strikes when closed.
3.  **Test for Functionality:** With the dryer unplugged, you can manually press the plunger. You should hear a click. Visually inspect the switch for any visible damage. The wires connected to it should be secure.
4.  **Test for Continuity (with Multimeter):** If you have a multimeter, you can test the switch. Disconnect the wires from the switch. Set your multimeter to the continuity setting. Press the plunger on the switch. When pressed, the switch should show continuity (beep or zero ohms). When released, it should show no continuity. If it fails either test, the switch is faulty.
5.  **Replace if Faulty:** A faulty door switch needs replacement. This is usually a straightforward repair. Replacement ensures the dryer can safely detect its door status.

Regular maintenance, such as cleaning your dryer's lint trap and vent, can prevent issues like a blown thermal fuse.
