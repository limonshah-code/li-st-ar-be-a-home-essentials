To tell how old your Kenmore refrigerator is, locate its serial number, usually found on a label inside the fresh food compartment. Decode the serial number using Kenmore’s date coding system, which typically embeds the year and week of manufacture. You can also check for a separate manufacturing date on the rating plate.

## Decoding the Kenmore Serial Number for Age

The serial number is the most reliable way to find your Kenmore refrigerator's age. This unique code identifies the specific unit. It often contains a hidden date of manufacture. Kenmore, a brand sold by Sears, used various manufacturers over the years. These manufacturers include Whirlpool, LG, GE, and Frigidaire. Each manufacturer might have slightly different serial number formats.

Understanding these formats helps you pinpoint the age. Many Kenmore serial numbers use a simple code. This code indicates the year and week of production. We will walk through common patterns to help you decode your appliance.

### Where to Find Your Kenmore Refrigerator's Serial Number

Finding the serial number is the first step. Manufacturers place this label in specific spots. These spots are usually easy to access but also protected. Check the fresh food compartment first. Open the refrigerator door and look along the inside walls.

The label might be on the side, near the top, or at the bottom of the compartment. Some models place it behind the crisper drawers. You may need to pull out a drawer to see it. It can also be on the appliance's exterior, sometimes on the back. A final spot is often on the door frame. Look closely, as labels can sometimes be small or blend in.

Once you find the label, you will see both the model number and the serial number. The serial number often begins with letters, followed by a series of numbers. It is important to write down both numbers accurately.

### Understanding Kenmore Serial Number Formats

Kenmore appliances, made by different companies, use different serial number patterns. For Whirlpool-made Kenmore units, the serial number often starts with two letters. The first letter represents the year of manufacture. The second letter represents the week of manufacture. For example, 'JA' might mean a specific year and week. You need a chart to translate these letters into actual dates.

For LG-made Kenmore units, the serial number might start with a letter and a number. The first digit often indicates the year. The following digits give the specific week or month. Frigidaire-made units often have a serial number starting with letters followed by a sequence of numbers where the first two digits after the letters specify the year, and the next two digits specify the week. If you have a Kenmore washing machine and want to know its age, a similar decoding process applies.

### Common Kenmore Serial Number Decoding Examples

Let us look at some common decoding examples. If your serial number starts with a letter-number combination like 'A0', 'B1', 'C2', and so on. The letter might signify the year, and the number might signify the week. For Whirlpool-made Kenmore refrigerators, a common format uses two letters. The first letter means the year. For instance, 'G' could be 2000, 'H' could be 2001, 'J' could be 2002, and so on. They skip certain letters like 'I', 'O', 'Q', 'U', 'X', 'Y', 'Z' to avoid confusion.

The second letter represents the week of that year. 'A' means week 1, 'B' means week 2, and so forth. So, a serial number starting with 'JG' would mean it was made in the 2002 (J) in the 7th week (G). You would need a full chart for precise decoding. Online resources and manufacturer websites often provide these charts. If you cannot find a chart, contacting Kenmore customer support with your full serial number is a good step.

## Using the Model Number and Manufacturing Labels

While the serial number provides the exact manufacturing date, the model number offers other clues. The model number helps identify the specific features and size of your refrigerator. Sometimes, older model numbers can hint at a general era of production. More importantly, other labels on the appliance might directly state a manufacturing date. These labels are often called rating plates or data plates.

These plates contain vital information about the appliance. They list electrical requirements, safety certifications, and sometimes the date. It is always worth checking all labels you find. This provides a fuller picture of your Kenmore refrigerator's history.

### Locating the Model Number Tag

The model number tag is usually on the same label as the serial number. As mentioned before, check inside the fresh food compartment. Common locations include the side wall, top interior, or behind the crisper drawers. It might also be on the door frame or on the back of the appliance.

The model number is typically longer than the serial number. It contains a series of numbers and sometimes letters. For example, a model number might look like "106.XXXXXXX" or "253.XXXXXXX". The numbers before the decimal point often indicate the manufacturer. For example, "106" often signifies Whirlpool. "253" often signifies Frigidaire. Knowing the manufacturer helps when looking up specific dating codes.

### Interpreting Date Codes on Labels

Some manufacturing labels include a clear date code. This code is not part of the serial number itself. It is a separate set of numbers or letters on the label. This code might directly state the month and year of manufacture. For example, you might see "MFG Date: 03/12" which means March 2012. Or it might be a four-digit number like "1203" where the first two digits are the year and the last two are the month.

Other times, the date code is less direct. It might be a combination of numbers that represent the year and day. For example, "YYDDD" where YY is the year (e.g., 10 for 2010) and DDD is the day of the year (e.g., 180 for June 29th). Always look for any text that says "Date," "MFG Date," "Prod Date," or similar. This is your best chance for a direct answer.

### When to Use Online Databases for Model Numbers

If you have the model number but struggle with the serial number, online databases can help. Many appliance parts websites let you enter your model number. They then show you compatible parts. These part lists often indicate the range of years for which the parts were produced. This can give you a general idea of your refrigerator's age.

You can also use the model number to search for product manuals online. Manuals often contain details about the appliance's features and original release year. While a model number rarely gives an exact manufacturing date, it helps narrow down the timeframe. For instance, if you have a Kenmore bottom freezer refrigerator model, knowing its cubic feet can be useful, and often relates to the model number itself.

## Visual Clues and Appliance History

Sometimes, the serial number or manufacturing labels are missing or unreadable. This often happens with very old appliances. In such cases, visual clues can provide hints about your Kenmore refrigerator's age. These clues include design elements, color, and features. Examining the refrigerator's overall appearance can suggest its era.

While less precise, this method helps narrow down the possibilities. It gives you a general timeframe for your appliance. Combine visual clues with any known history of the appliance. This can help create a more accurate estimate of its age.

### Assessing Refrigerator Design Eras

Appliance design changes over time. Older refrigerators might have simpler designs. They might feature exposed hinges or a more boxy shape. Colors also indicate age. Avocado green or harvest gold were popular in the 1970s. Almond or bisque was common in the 1980s and 1990s. Stainless steel became very popular in the 2000s and continues today.

Handle styles also evolve. Older models might have simple bar handles. Newer ones often feature integrated or ergonomic designs. Interior features also change. Early models had basic shelving. Newer ones boast adjustable shelves, LED lighting, and more sophisticated temperature controls. You can often make an educated guess about the decade of manufacture by looking at these design elements.

### Checking for Energy Star Ratings and Certifications

Energy Star ratings began in 1992. If your Kenmore refrigerator has an Energy Star label, it was manufactured in 1992 or later. The label itself sometimes includes a version number or year. Newer Energy Star labels are more specific. They often show estimated annual energy consumption.

Older appliances lack these certifications. Their absence suggests a pre-1992 manufacturing date. This clue helps narrow the age range considerably. Look for other certification labels too, like UL (Underwriters Laboratories) or ETL. While these do not directly state age, their presence confirms compliance with safety standards common in certain periods.

### Maintenance Records and Purchase Receipts

The best way to know your refrigerator's exact age, aside from decoding the numbers, is through its history. Did you buy the refrigerator new? If so, check your original purchase receipts. The date on the receipt is the purchase date. This date is very close to the manufacturing date.

If you bought the refrigerator used, ask the previous owner for records. They might have the original receipt or warranty information. Even maintenance records can help. A service technician's report might list the appliance's age or model year. These documents provide direct evidence of your refrigerator's past. Keeping good records for all home appliances is a good practice. Knowing your appliance's history also helps when troubleshooting problems, such as a Kenmore refrigerator not cooling properly.
