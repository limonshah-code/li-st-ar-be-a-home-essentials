## Why Your Samsung Top Load Washer Won't Drain

Your Samsung top load washing machine may fail to drain water for several reasons. Understanding these reasons helps you fix the problem effectively. A common cause is a clogged drain pump filter. This filter traps lint, coins, or other small items. When it gets full, water cannot pass through.

Another issue can be a problem with the drain pump itself. The pump moves water out of the machine. If the pump motor fails or something blocks its impeller, water stays in the tub. You might hear a humming sound but no draining.

The drain hose connection also plays a role. If the hose has a kink, a blockage inside, or is installed too high, water struggles to leave. Problems with the machine's control board or lid switch also prevent proper draining. The machine needs to know the lid is closed before it starts a spin cycle. Let's look at why your [Samsung washing machine no water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-samsung-washing-machine-no-water) might occur, as these issues can sometimes be linked to drainage problems if the machine tries to sense water levels incorrectly. Identifying the exact cause makes solving the drainage issue much simpler.

### Common Reasons for Drainage Issues

*   **Clogged Drain Pump Filter:** The most frequent cause. Small items or lint build up here.
*   **Blocked Drain Hose:** Kinks, twists, or internal obstructions stop water flow.
*   **Faulty Drain Pump:** The pump motor or impeller might not work correctly.
*   **Lid Switch Malfunction:** The machine will not spin or drain if it thinks the lid is open.
*   **Overloaded Machine:** Too many clothes can throw off the balance and prevent proper spinning, which aids draining.
*   **Improper Installation:** The drain hose may sit too high, making it difficult for the pump to push water out. Did you know a washing machine can drain up? Learn more about how a [washing machine drain up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-a-washing-machine-drain-up) works.

Understanding these points helps you approach the problem systematically. We move from simple checks to more involved solutions. This approach saves you time and effort.

## Essential Safety Steps Before You Start

Safety comes first when working with any appliance. Your Samsung washing machine uses both water and electricity. This combination creates a shock hazard if you are not careful. Before touching any part of the machine, you must take specific precautions.

Always unplug the washing machine from the wall outlet. This step cuts off all electrical power. It removes the risk of electric shock. Do not assume the machine is off just because it is not running. Always pull the plug. Next, turn off the water supply to the washing machine. You will find two faucets behind the machine. One for hot water and one for cold. Turn both handles clockwise until they stop. This prevents more water from entering the machine. It also prevents leaks while you work.

Prepare your workspace. You will deal with standing water. Lay down towels or have a wet-dry vacuum ready. This protects your floor from water damage. It also makes cleanup easier. Wear gloves for hygiene, especially if the water is dirty. Having a bucket nearby is also crucial for collecting drained water. These simple steps ensure your safety and protect your home.

### Safety Checklist

*   **Unplug the Machine:** Disconnect from the power outlet completely.
*   **Turn Off Water Supply:** Close hot and cold water faucets.

*   **Wear Protective Gear:** Gloves are good for handling dirty water.

Taking these steps helps you work without worry. They are simple actions with big safety benefits. Never skip these initial precautions.

## Quick Fix: Using the "Spin Only" Cycle

Sometimes, your Samsung top load washing machine does not drain because a cycle stopped too early. Or maybe it failed to engage the drain pump properly. In many cases, you can solve this with a simple step. Try running a "Spin Only" cycle. This often prompts the machine to activate its drain pump.

First, make sure the machine is plugged in and the water supply is on. Then, close the lid securely. Next, find the cycle selector on your machine's control panel. Look for an option labeled "Spin Only," "Drain & Spin," or similar. Select this cycle. You might need to press the "Start/Pause" button to begin the cycle. The machine will then attempt to drain the water and spin the clothes. This process usually takes about 10-15 minutes.

Listen for the drain pump engaging. You should hear a distinct hum as the water starts to flow out. Check the drain hose at the back of the machine. It should be expelling water into the utility sink or standpipe. If the machine successfully drains and spins, the problem might have been a minor glitch. If the water remains, or the cycle does not complete, then a deeper issue exists. Do not worry; we have other methods to try. Running a "Spin Only" cycle is a good first step to rule out simple electronic errors.

### Steps for a "Spin Only" Cycle

1.  **Plug In and Connect:** Ensure the machine is plugged in and water supply is open.
2.  **Close Lid:** Make sure the washer lid is fully closed.
3.  **Select Cycle:** Turn the dial to "Spin Only" or "Drain & Spin."
4.  **Start Cycle:** Press the "Start/Pause" button.
5.  **Monitor Drainage:** Watch if water drains and clothes spin.

This method works for many minor drainage issues. If it does not work, it means we need to investigate more.

## Manual Draining: Accessing the Drain Hose

When the "Spin Only" cycle fails, you need to drain the water manually. This method involves using the washing machine's drain hose. It is a reliable way to remove water when the pump is not working. First, ensure the safety steps are complete: unplug the machine and turn off water valves. This is critical before you start.

Next, you need to access the drain hose. This hose is typically at the back of your Samsung top load washing machine. It runs from the machine to a utility sink or a standpipe in your wall. Pull the machine away from the wall enough to comfortably reach behind it. Have a large bucket or a shallow pan ready. You will collect a lot of water. Depending on your machine's model, the hose might be clipped high up.

Carefully remove the drain hose from its current position. This is usually from the standpipe or sink. Lower the end of the hose to the floor, into your bucket or pan. Gravity will start to pull the water out of the machine. The water flow can be strong. Be ready to switch buckets if one fills up quickly. Once the water stops flowing from the main hose, you have drained most of the water. Some residual water may remain in the tub, but the bulk is gone. This manual process is often the first step in [how to drain water from Samsung washing machine manually](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-water-from-samsung-washing-machine-manually).

### Manual Drain Hose Steps

1.  **Power Down & Water Off:** Unplug the washer and close the water supply valves.
2.  **Move Washer:** Pull the machine out from the wall to reach the back.
3.  **Prepare Container:** Place a large bucket or shallow pan on the floor.
4.  **Remove Drain Hose:** Carefully detach the drain hose from the standpipe or sink.
5.  **Lower Hose:** Place the end of the drain hose into the prepared bucket.
6.  **Drain Water:** Allow gravity to pull the water from the machine into the bucket.
7.  **Manage Spills:** Be prepared for fast water flow and change buckets as needed.

This method gets the water out. Once the water is gone, you can investigate the cause of the drainage problem.

## Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter

A clogged drain pump filter is a very common reason for drainage issues. This filter protects the pump from debris. It traps lint, small clothing items, coins, or pet hair. When it becomes too full, water cannot pass through, and your Samsung top load washing machine will not drain. Cleaning this filter is a simple DIY task.

First, ensure your machine is unplugged and the water supply is off. Always prioritize safety. The drain pump filter on most Samsung top load models is located on the lower front side of the machine. It is often behind a small access panel or a kick plate. You might need a flathead screwdriver or a coin to pry open this panel. Once the panel is open, you will see a round cap or a hose with a cap.

Before unscrewing the filter cap, place a shallow pan and towels under it. There will be residual water inside. Slowly twist the cap counter-clockwise to open it. Water will start to flow out. Let all the water drain into your pan. Once the water stops, remove the filter completely. Inspect it for any foreign objects. Remove all lint, coins, buttons, or hair. Use an old toothbrush to scrub the filter clean under running water. Also, check the filter housing inside the machine for any blockages. Reinsert the clean filter and screw the cap back on tightly. Close the access panel. Now, you can try a "Spin Only" cycle again. Clearing this filter often solves the problem.

### Steps to Clean the Drain Pump Filter

1.  **Safety First:** Unplug the washer and turn off the water supply.
2.  **Locate Filter:** Find the access panel on the lower front of your machine.
3.  **Open Panel:** Use a screwdriver or coin to open the panel.
4.  **Prepare for Water:** Place a shallow pan and towels under the filter area.
5.  **Drain Residual Water:** Slowly unscrew the filter cap counter-clockwise to let water out.
6.  **Remove & Clean Filter:** Once empty, fully remove the filter. Clear all debris. Rinse it under water.
7.  **Inspect Housing:** Check the filter housing for any remaining clogs.
8.  **Reinstall Filter:** Screw the clean filter back in tightly. Close the access panel.

This regular maintenance step can prevent future drainage problems. It keeps your washing machine running efficiently.

## Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose

After checking the drain pump filter, the next logical step is to inspect the drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the washing machine to your home's drain system. Any problem with this hose will prevent proper draining. First, make sure your machine is unplugged and water supply is off.

Begin by inspecting the entire length of the drain hose. Look for obvious kinks or bends. The hose needs a smooth, unobstructed path. If you find any kinks, gently straighten them out. Ensure the hose is not compressed against a wall or other appliances. Sometimes, the hose might be installed incorrectly. It could be too high in the standpipe. The top of the drain hose should not be more than 96 inches (2.4 meters) above the floor. If it is too high, the drain pump struggles to push water up. Adjust its height if needed.

Next, check for blockages inside the hose. Disconnect the hose from the standpipe or utility sink. If water still pours out, that indicates a blockage further down the hose or in the machine itself. Use a flashlight to look inside the hose from both ends. You might see a blockage near the end that connects to the machine. You can try to clear minor blockages with a long, flexible brush or by flushing water through it. Be careful not to damage the hose. If the hose is severely blocked or damaged, you may need to replace it. A good, clear drain hose is essential for a properly draining Samsung top load washing machine.

### Drain Hose Inspection Steps

1.  **Safety Check:** Unplug the washer and turn off water valves.
2.  **Visual Inspection:** Look for kinks, twists, or sharp bends along the entire hose length.
3.  **Check Height:** Ensure the hose is not too high in the standpipe (max 96 inches).
4.  **Disconnect Hose:** Remove the hose from the standpipe or sink.
5.  **Internal Blockage Check:** Look inside with a flashlight. Clear any visible debris.
6.  **Test Flow:** Run water through the hose (e.g., from a faucet) to check for clear flow.
7.  **Reattach Securely:** Connect the hose back properly without kinks.

Ensuring your drain hose is clear and properly positioned is vital. It is a common cause of standing water in your washing machine.

## Troubleshooting Advanced Drainage Problems

If you have cleaned the filter and checked the drain hose, but your Samsung top load washing machine still won't drain, the problem might be more complex. We need to look at other possible issues. These often involve the drain pump itself or electrical components. Always ensure the machine is unplugged before any deeper inspection.

One possibility is a faulty drain pump. The drain pump makes a distinct humming sound when it tries to operate. If you hear this hum but no water moves, the pump's impeller might be jammed. Small objects can get past the filter and into the pump. Sometimes, the pump motor fails completely. In this case, you hear nothing or a weak, struggling sound. Replacing a drain pump can be a DIY task for those comfortable with appliance repair. You can find many guides online or in your appliance manual for [how to repair top load washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-repair-top-load-washing-machine) drain pumps.

Another issue could be the lid switch. Top load washers rely on a functioning lid switch to operate drain and spin cycles. If the machine thinks the lid is open, it will not drain. Check if the lid switch is physically broken or stuck. Sometimes, the switch connection becomes loose. You can test the lid switch with a multimeter if you are familiar with electrical testing. For more serious electrical issues or control board problems, calling a certified technician is the safest and most effective option. Do not attempt repairs if you are unsure.

### Advanced Troubleshooting Checklist

*   **Test Drain Pump:** Listen for humming. If no water, check for jammed impeller. If no hum, pump motor might be bad.
*   **Inspect Lid Switch:** Ensure it closes properly. Check for physical damage or loose connections.
*   **Check Belts (Older Models):** Some older top load models use belts for the pump. Check if the belt is loose or broken.
*   **Examine Wiring:** Look for loose or damaged wires connected to the drain pump or control board.
*   **Professional Help:** If unsure, or if the problem is electrical, contact a qualified appliance repair technician.

These steps cover more involved issues. Remember, safety is paramount. If a repair feels beyond your skill level, professional help is always the best choice.

## Preventing Future Drainage Issues

Preventing problems is always better than fixing them. You can take simple steps to keep your Samsung top load washing machine draining smoothly. These actions help extend your appliance's life. They also save you from frustrating laundry setbacks.

First, always check pockets before washing clothes. Small items like coins, keys, or tissues are the main culprits for clogging the drain pump filter. Teach everyone in your household to empty their pockets. This simple habit dramatically reduces the risk of clogs. Next, clean the drain pump filter regularly. I recommend checking it every few months, or more often if you wash items with a lot of lint or pet hair. This keeps the filter clear and prevents build-up. A clean filter allows water to flow freely.

Proper installation and use of the drain hose are also key. Ensure the drain hose is not kinked or bent behind the machine. It should have a gentle curve into the standpipe or sink. Also, confirm the hose is not inserted too far down the standpipe. This creates a siphoning effect, which can lead to drain problems. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for drain hose height. Finally, avoid overloading your washing machine. Overloading can imbalance the tub. This prevents proper spinning and draining. Always leave enough space for clothes to move freely. These preventative measures keep your Samsung top load washer working well.

### Prevention Tips

*   **Empty Pockets:** Always check clothes for small items before washing.
*   **Regular Filter Cleaning:** Clean the drain pump filter every 2-3 months.
*   **Inspect Drain Hose:** Ensure no kinks, proper height, and secure connection.
*   **Do Not Overload:** Avoid putting too many clothes in the machine per cycle.
*   **Use Proper Detergent:** Use the correct type and amount of detergent to prevent suds build-up.
*   **Run Cleaning Cycles:** Perform a tub clean cycle periodically to remove residue.

Following these tips helps maintain your washing machine's drainage system. It keeps your laundry routine running smoothly.
