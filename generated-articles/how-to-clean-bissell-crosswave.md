## How To Clean Your Bissell Crosswave for Peak Performance

Your Bissell Crosswave is an amazing tool. It cleans hard floors and area rugs with ease. It picks up wet and dry messes in one go. To keep it working its best, you must clean your Bissell Crosswave regularly. A well-maintained machine cleans better and lasts longer.

I know how frustrating it is when your favorite cleaning tool starts acting up. Often, a good cleaning fixes common issues like odors or poor suction. This guide will show you how to clean every part of your Bissell Crosswave. We will cover dirty water tanks, brush rolls, and filters. Follow these steps to ensure your Crosswave stays fresh and effective for every cleaning task. Let's get your Crosswave sparkling clean!

#### Takeaway:

*   Regularly clean your Bissell Crosswave's dirty water tank after each use.
*   Thoroughly clean the brush roll and brush roll window to prevent odors and maintain cleaning power.
*   Inspect and clean filters often, replacing them when needed for optimal performance.
*   Allow all parts to dry completely before reassembling your Crosswave.

To clean your Bissell Crosswave, empty and rinse the dirty water tank after each use. Remove and clean the brush roll, filter, and brush roll window. Dry all components fully before reassembly to prevent mold and odors.

### Understanding Your Bissell Crosswave's Design

The Bissell Crosswave is a versatile machine. It combines vacuuming and mopping actions. This design means it handles both dry debris and liquid messes. Its dual-tank system keeps clean solution separate from dirty water. This ensures you always clean with fresh water. The brush roll scrubs surfaces while suction removes the mess.

Over time, dirt, hair, and dirty water residue can build up. This buildup can lead to bad odors. It can also reduce the machine's cleaning power. Neglecting to clean parts like the brush roll or dirty water tank will hinder performance. Proper maintenance ensures your Crosswave continues to deliver a deep clean. Knowing each part's function helps you clean it correctly.

This will give you a broader understanding of proper maintenance for your cleaning tools. Keeping your machines clean ensures they perform well for a long time.

### Pre-Cleaning Steps: Preparing Your Crosswave

Before you start cleaning your Bissell Crosswave, you need to prepare it. This ensures safety and makes the cleaning process easier. Always unplug the machine from the power outlet. This prevents any accidental starts during cleaning. You should also ensure both the clean water tank and dirty water tank are empty. If there is any solution left in the clean tank, pour it out.

Empty the dirty water tank immediately after each use. This prevents grime from hardening and odors from forming. Rinse both tanks with warm water to remove any lingering residue. Take off the brush roll cover and remove the brush roll itself. Have a cleaning cloth and a small brush ready. You may need them to reach tight spots. This simple preparation makes the rest of the cleaning process smoother and more effective.

### Cleaning the Dirty Water Tank and Strainer

The dirty water tank collects all the grime from your floors. It is the most important part to clean after every use. Failure to clean it will cause strong, unpleasant odors. Start by removing the tank from the machine. Open the tank and pour out all the dirty water. You will likely see hair and debris in the tank.

Next, remove the strainer from inside the dirty water tank. This strainer catches larger particles. Rinse the tank and strainer thoroughly under running water. Use warm water to help dislodge any sticky residue. You can use a mild dish soap if the tank feels particularly greasy. Scrub the inside of the tank with a brush to remove stuck-on dirt. Pay attention to corners and edges where gunk can hide. Ensure all parts are completely clean before letting them air dry.

Sometimes, people wonder what types of solutions are safe for their cleaners. To ensure you use suitable products, you can review information on [what else can I use in my Bissell carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-else-can-i-use-in-my-bissell-carpet-cleaner). This helps you make informed choices about your cleaning agents.

### Maintaining the Brush Roll and Brush Roll Window

The brush roll does the heavy lifting when cleaning your floors. It picks up dirt and scrubs surfaces. Hair, fibers, and dirt often get tangled around it. The brush roll window protects the brush and directs airflow. Both need regular cleaning. First, remove the brush roll cover. Then, carefully pull out the brush roll.

Use scissors to cut away any hair or strings wrapped around the brush roll. You might be surprised by how much accumulates. Rinse the brush roll under running water. Use your fingers or a small brush to dislodge any stuck-on debris. Ensure the bristles are free from grime. Clean the brush roll window as well. This clear cover can collect dirt and water spots. Wipe it down with a damp cloth. Make sure no hair or debris remains under the window. Allow the brush roll and window to air dry completely before putting them back. This step is important to prevent mold and mildew growth.

If you have other Bissell carpet cleaners, the process for removing the brush might be similar. For detailed instructions, you can check out how to [remove brush from Bissell carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-brush-from-bissell-carpet-cleaner). This ensures you handle your machine correctly.

### Cleaning the Filters for Optimal Performance

Your Bissell Crosswave has a filter that traps fine particles. A clean filter is vital for proper suction and airflow. A clogged filter makes your machine less effective. It can also put a strain on the motor. Most Crosswave models have a pleated filter located inside the dirty water tank assembly. Check your specific model's manual for exact filter location.

To clean the filter, remove it from its housing. Tap it gently over a trash can to dislodge loose debris. Rinse the filter under running water. Do not use soap, as it can damage the filter material. Squeeze out excess water. It is very important to let the filter air dry completely for at least 24 hours. Placing a wet filter back into the machine can cause odors and damage the motor. I usually place mine on a windowsill or near a fan. Have a spare filter ready so you can use your machine while the other one dries. Replacing filters every 3-6 months, depending on usage, is a good practice.

While discussing filter maintenance, some people wonder about different types of filtration systems. If you're curious about whether your particular model or other Bissell products include advanced filtration, you might find it useful to read about [does Bissell Crosswave have HEPA filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-bissell-crosswave-have-hepa-filter). Understanding your machine's filtration system helps with overall care.

### Deep Cleaning the Machine Base and Clean Water Tank

While the dirty water tank and brush roll require frequent attention, the machine base and clean water tank also need periodic deep cleaning. The machine base, where the brush roll sits, can accumulate grime. Water and solution sometimes splash into this area. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the entire base. Pay close attention to the area around the brush roll opening. Remove any caked-on dirt or dried solution. You can use a cotton swab to clean hard-to-reach crevices.

The clean water tank usually stays clean. However, residue from cleaning solutions can build up over time. This can affect how new solution dispenses. Rinse the clean water tank thoroughly with warm water. If you notice any film or smell, you can add a small amount of white vinegar to the water. Swirl it around and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing. Always ensure the clean tank is empty before storing the machine. This prevents water from becoming stagnant and causing odors. Allow it to air dry completely before reattaching it.

When considering what to put in your cleaner, remember that using harsh chemicals can damage your machine. It is crucial to know what substances are safe. For example, understanding if you [can I use bleach in my Bissell carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-bleach-in-my-bissell-carpet-cleaner) is important before trying new cleaning agents.

### Post-Cleaning Care and Storage Tips

After you have cleaned all the individual components, it is time for reassembly and storage. Make sure every part is bone dry. This is critical to prevent mold, mildew, and unpleasant smells. Damp parts create a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Once dry, put the filter back in its place. Reinsert the brush roll and secure the brush roll window and cover. Snap the dirty water tank back onto the machine.

When storing your Crosswave, always keep it upright. Store it in a cool, dry place. Do not leave any water or cleaning solution in either tank. Leaving solution in the clean water tank can cause clogs or damage internal components over time. Leaving dirty water will definitely lead to awful odors. Some Crosswave models come with a storage tray. This tray collects any drips and helps air circulation around the brush roll. If you have one, use it. Proper storage extends the life of your machine and keeps it ready for the next cleaning task.

The cleaning principles for Bissell machines are similar across models. If you own other Bissell products, like the Little Green, you can find general care advice on [how to clean Bissell Little Green](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bissell-little-green). This helps you maintain all your cleaning tools.

### Troubleshooting Common Crosswave Cleaning Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter a few issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems can save you time and frustration. One common problem is a persistent bad odor. This usually means moisture or grime remains in the dirty water tank or brush roll area. Go back and re-clean these parts. Pay extra attention to corners and crevices. Make sure everything is fully dry before reassembling. Adding a few drops of white vinegar to the rinse water for the dirty tank can help neutralize smells.

Another issue is poor suction. This often points to a clogged filter or brush roll. Check your filter first. If it is dirty, clean or replace it. Then, inspect the brush roll for excessive hair or debris. Clear any obstructions. Sometimes, blockages can occur in the machine's internal suction path. Use a long, thin brush or tool to carefully clear any visible clogs. If your Crosswave is leaving streaks, the brush roll might be dirty or damaged. Clean the brush roll thoroughly. If streaks persist, it may be time to replace the brush roll.

Different Bissell models may have unique cleaning considerations. For instance, the Bissell Revolution Pet Pro has specific design features for pet messes.

### Frequency and Best Practices for Bissell Crosswave Cleaning

How often should you clean your Bissell Crosswave? It depends on your usage. For optimal performance and hygiene, I recommend cleaning the dirty water tank and rinsing the brush roll after *every single use*. This prevents immediate odor and grime buildup. The more thorough cleaning, which includes removing and washing the brush roll, brush roll window, and filter, should happen every 2-3 uses if you clean frequently. If you use it less often, a thorough clean once a month is sufficient.

Here are some best practices I follow:

*   **Always empty the dirty water tank immediately.** Never let dirty water sit in the machine.
*   **Use only Bissell-approved formulas.** Other solutions can cause foaming, clogs, or damage seals.
*   **Air dry all parts completely.** This is the number one rule to prevent mold and mildew.
*   **Store in a dry, upright position.** Keep it away from humid areas.
*   **Replace filters and brush rolls as needed.** Worn-out parts reduce cleaning efficiency.
*   **Run clean water through the machine after using.** Some models have a self-cleaning cycle. If yours does not, simply run a tank of clean water through it to rinse internal lines. This helps flush out residual solution.

Following these practices will keep your Bissell Crosswave running smoothly. It will continue to provide excellent cleaning results for years to come.

### FAQ Section
