## How To Get Smell Out Of Dog Bed: Complete Guide

Our furry friends bring so much joy into our homes. Yet, their beds can sometimes become a source of unpleasant odors. That distinct "dog smell" often settles deep into fabrics. It can make your whole house smell less fresh. Learning how to get smell out of dog bed is essential for a clean home and a happy pet.

A smelly dog bed is more than just a nuisance. It can harbor bacteria and allergens. This impacts your pet's health and your family's comfort. Nobody wants a stinky pet bed, especially one your dog spends so much time on. I have faced this challenge with my own dog's bed. I understand the frustration. This guide provides clear, practical steps. You will learn how to deep clean, use natural remedies, and prevent future odors. We will cover everything you need to know.

### Takeaway:

*   Regularly wash dog bed covers and inserts.
*   Use enzymatic cleaners for urine and biological odors.
*   Baking soda is effective for absorbing general smells.
*   Ensure the bed is completely dry to prevent mildew.
*   Prevent future odors with consistent grooming and cleaning routines.

To get smell out of a dog bed, start by washing covers with pet-safe detergent and enzymatic cleaner. For non-washable parts, sprinkle baking soda, let it sit, then vacuum thoroughly. Ensure all components dry completely. Air drying in sunlight helps. This process tackles odors at their source.

## Understanding Why Dog Beds Get Smelly

Dog beds absorb many things from our pets over time. Dog beds are not just for sleeping. Dogs shed hair and dander. They also transfer body oils and saliva. These substances build up on the bed's surface. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria. Bacteria cause unpleasant odors.

My dog loves to chew on toys in his bed. Drool and food bits get left behind. This adds to the mess and the smell. Urine accidents can also happen, especially with puppies or older dogs. These accidents leave behind strong, persistent odors. Even healthy dogs have a natural smell that accumulates. This smell becomes more noticeable in their bedding.

Over time, this accumulation of dirt and organic matter leads to a stale, musty odor. This distinct smell can permeate your entire living space. Regular cleaning prevents this build-up. It keeps your home smelling fresh. A clean bed is important for your dog's hygiene too.

## Essential Preparation Before Cleaning Your Dog Bed

Proper preparation is important before you start cleaning. This step makes the cleaning process more effective. It also prevents damage to the dog bed. I always start by checking the care label. Most dog beds have specific washing instructions. Some covers are machine washable. Other beds may require spot cleaning only.

First, take the dog bed outside or lay it on a hard surface. Shake out any loose dirt, hair, or debris. You will be surprised how much comes out. Then, use a vacuum cleaner with an upholstery attachment. Vacuum the entire surface of the bed. This removes embedded pet hair and dirt. This initial step makes the washing process easier. It also helps prevent hair from clogging your washing machine.

For any visible stains, pre-treat them before washing. Use a pet-safe stain remover. Test it on a small, hidden area first. This ensures the cleaner will not damage or discolor the fabric. Pre-treating helps lift stubborn stains and odors. This prepares the bed for a deeper clean. Proper preparation ensures you truly get the smell out of your dog bed.

## Deep Cleaning Methods for Washable Dog Beds

Most modern dog beds come with removable covers. These covers are machine washable. This makes regular cleaning much easier. Always check the care label on your dog bed first. This label provides specific washing instructions. It tells you if the cover can be machine washed.

For machine-washable covers, zip them up before putting them in the washer. Use cold water and a gentle cycle. Hot water can sometimes set stains or damage certain fabrics. I use a pet-safe laundry detergent. These detergents are formulated to be gentle. They do not contain harsh chemicals or fragrances that might irritate your dog. For tough odors, consider adding an enzymatic cleaner to the wash cycle. Enzymatic cleaners break down organic matter. This effectively neutralizes odors from urine, saliva, and body oils.

After washing, drying the dog bed thoroughly is critical. Even a slightly damp bed can develop mildew. Mildew creates a new, musty smell. Air drying is always the best option if possible. Hang the cover outdoors in direct sunlight. Sunlight is a natural disinfectant and odor remover. If using a dryer, set it to a low heat or air-fluff setting. Add a few tennis balls to the dryer. They help fluff up the bed and ensure even drying. Make sure the bed is completely dry before letting your dog use it again. This prevents mildew and keeps the bed fresh.

### Using Enzymatic Cleaners for Tough Odors

Enzymatic cleaners are powerful tools for odor removal. They contain special enzymes. These enzymes break down organic stains and odors. This includes urine, feces, vomit, and other pet messes. Regular detergents mask odors. Enzymatic cleaners destroy the odor source.

To use an enzymatic cleaner, apply it directly to the affected area. Saturate the spot completely. Let the cleaner sit for the time recommended on the bottle. This allows the enzymes to work. Then, blot the area with a clean cloth. For machine washable items, add the cleaner to your wash cycle. This helps to get smell out of dog bed fabrics deeply.

Enzymatic cleaners are especially effective for urine odors. Urine leaves behind uric acid crystals. These crystals cause the lingering smell. Enzymes break down these crystals. This eliminates the odor completely. Always choose a cleaner specifically designed for pet odors. Ensure it is safe for pets once dry.

### Laundry Additives for Odor Control

Beyond enzymatic cleaners, other laundry additives can boost odor removal. White vinegar is a popular natural option. It helps neutralize odors. Add half a cup of distilled white vinegar to the rinse cycle of your washing machine. Do not worry about the vinegar smell. It dissipates as the bed dries. Vinegar also acts as a natural fabric softener.

Another effective additive is baking soda. You can add half a cup of baking soda directly to the wash drum with your detergent. Baking soda is a natural deodorizer. It absorbs and neutralizes odors. This helps to refresh the fabric. For very smelly beds, you can pre-soak the cover in a mixture of water and baking soda. Let it soak for a few hours before washing.

Specialized pet odor eliminators are also available. These products often contain powerful deodorizing agents. They can be added to the wash or used as a pre-treatment spray. Always follow the product instructions carefully. Ensure they are safe for your dog's bedding. These additives work together with your detergent. They provide a comprehensive approach to getting rid of stubborn smells.

## Tackling Non-Washable Dog Beds and Inserts

Some dog beds, especially orthopedic or memory foam ones, may not have removable covers. Their inserts are often not machine washable. This requires a different cleaning approach. You can still effectively get smell out of dog bed components that cannot be submerged in water. Spot cleaning is your primary method here.

Start by vacuuming the entire bed thoroughly. This removes loose hair, dirt, and dander. For visible stains or soiled areas, use a pet-safe spot cleaner. Spray the cleaner directly onto the stain. Blot the area with a clean, damp cloth. Avoid scrubbing, as this can spread the stain. Always test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not discolor the fabric.

Baking soda is a powerful natural deodorizer for non-washable inserts. Liberally sprinkle baking soda over the entire surface of the bed. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. Baking soda absorbs odors. After the sitting time, vacuum up the baking soda completely. You might need to repeat this process for strong odors. Placing the bed in direct sunlight for a few hours also helps. UV rays are natural disinfectants. They help break down odor-causing bacteria.

## Natural Remedies for Odor Elimination

Sometimes, you prefer using natural ingredients to get smell out of dog bed. These methods are often safe and readily available. They can be very effective for general freshening or light odors. My go-to natural remedy is always baking soda. It's truly amazing.

**Baking Soda:** This common pantry item is a fantastic odor absorber. For a dog bed, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda directly over the entire surface. Work it into the fabric with a brush or your hands. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes, but longer is better – even overnight. The longer it sits, the more odors it absorbs. After the waiting period, vacuum up all the baking soda thoroughly. This method is great for general musty smells.

**White Vinegar:** Distilled white vinegar is another powerful natural deodorizer. Its acidic nature neutralizes alkaline odors from urine and other pet messes. Create a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist the dog bed surface. Do not saturate it. Let the solution air dry completely. The vinegar smell will dissipate as it dries.

**Sunlight:** The sun's UV rays are natural disinfectants. They kill odor-causing bacteria and break down organic compounds. After cleaning, place the dog bed outdoors in direct sunlight for a few hours. This helps to air it out and naturally eliminate any lingering odors. Always ensure the bed is completely dry before bringing it back inside.

**Essential Oils (Use with Caution):** While some people use essential oils for fragrance, I advise extreme caution with pets. Many essential oils are toxic to dogs, even in small amounts. If you choose to use them, apply only a tiny drop of pet-safe oil (like lavender or cedarwood, highly diluted) to a cotton ball. Then place the cotton ball near, but not on, the bed. Never apply oils directly to the bed or diffuse them heavily around your pet. Your dog's health comes first.

## Dealing with Specific Odors: Urine and Poo

Urine and feces odors are particularly challenging. They penetrate deep into fabric fibers. They leave behind stubborn, lingering smells. Immediate action is key to effectively get smell out of dog bed from these accidents. My first step is always to remove as much of the solid or liquid mess as possible.

For urine, blot the area with paper towels or a clean cloth. Apply firm pressure. Keep blotting until no more liquid transfers. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the urine and push it deeper into the fabric. Once the area is as dry as possible, it's time for an enzymatic cleaner. Enzymatic cleaners are crucial for urine. They break down the uric acid crystals that cause the strong odor. Spray the cleaner generously over the affected area. Ensure it saturates the spot as deeply as the urine did. Let it sit for the time specified on the cleaner's label. This allows the enzymes to work properly. Then, blot dry. You may need to repeat this process several times for complete odor removal. For stubborn urine odors on other surfaces, these guides might help: [how to clean dog pee out of rug](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dog-pee-out-of-rug), [how to clean dog urine from carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dog-urine-from-carpet), and [how to get dog urine out of couch foam](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-dog-urine-out-of-couch-foam).

For solid waste, carefully remove it using paper towels. Then, follow the same blotting process for any residue. Apply an enzymatic cleaner to break down the organic matter and eliminate the smell. Again, saturation and dwell time are important. After cleaning, ensure the bed is completely dry. Air drying outdoors is ideal for these types of odors. It allows for maximum ventilation. Sometimes, multiple treatments are necessary to fully eliminate the deep-set odor. Persistence pays off when dealing with these tough smells.

## Long-Term Prevention: Keeping Your Dog Bed Fresh

Preventing odors is far easier than removing them. A proactive approach keeps your dog's bed smelling fresh. This also creates a healthier environment for your pet. I follow a few simple routines to keep my dog's bed clean.

First, establish a regular washing schedule. For dog beds with removable covers, wash them weekly or bi-weekly. This depends on how much your dog uses the bed and how active they are. Even if the bed doesn't look dirty, oils and dander accumulate quickly. Consistent cleaning prevents strong odors from developing. For general hygiene, remember to keep your pet clean, as a clean pet often means a cleaner bed. You might find some useful tips on [how to clean dog paws](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dog-paws) or [how to clean dog toys](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dog-toys).

Consider using waterproof or washable dog bed liners. These liners protect the main bed insert from accidents and spills. They are much easier to wash than the entire bed. Many dog beds now come with these features. If yours doesn't, you can often buy them separately. Regularly grooming your dog also helps. Brushing your dog removes loose hair and dander. It also distributes natural oils evenly. This reduces the amount of shedding on the bed. Regular baths help keep their fur clean.

Controlling humidity in your home can prevent musty smells. High humidity encourages mold and mildew growth. This makes odors worse. Use a dehumidifier in damp areas if needed. Ensure good air circulation around the dog bed. Avoid placing it in a perpetually damp or enclosed space. Allow fresh air to circulate. This helps to air out the bed naturally. By combining regular cleaning with preventative measures, you can ensure your dog's bed remains a clean and inviting spot. This keeps your home smelling fresh.
