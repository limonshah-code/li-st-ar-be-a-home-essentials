## The Science of Non-Stick: PTFE and PFOA in Air Fryers

Let us explore the materials behind non-stick surfaces in air fryers. PTFE, or Polytetrafluoroethylene, is the core component. This polymer creates a slick, low-friction surface. This is why food slides off easily. PTFE is inert, meaning it does not react with food or water. It also withstands high temperatures, which is essential for air frying.

Historically, PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) was used in the production of PTFE. PFOA was a processing aid, not part of the final coating itself. However, PFOA raised health concerns due to its persistence in the environment and human body. Studies linked PFOA to various health issues. This led to a global effort to phase out its use.

Today, nearly all modern non-stick cookware and appliances, including Gourmia air fryers, are PFOA-free. Manufacturers have developed new methods to produce PTFE without using PFOA. This significant change means consumers no longer need to worry about PFOA exposure from their non-stick air fryers. The PFOA-free designation is a crucial safety standard.

The non-stick coating on your Gourmia air fryer basket is designed for daily use. It provides excellent food release. This minimizes the need for added oils or sprays. The material's durability depends on how you use and clean it. Extreme temperatures or harsh cleaning methods can degrade the coating over time.

It is important to understand that PTFE itself is considered safe for cooking. It only becomes a concern if overheated to extreme temperatures (above 500°F or 260°C). At these temperatures, the coating can degrade and release fumes. Air fryers operate within safe temperature ranges for non-stick coatings. They typically do not reach levels that cause PTFE to break down. This ensures your cooking remains safe and efficient.
