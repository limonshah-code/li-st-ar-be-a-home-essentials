When you ask, "How much is an Ooni pizza oven?", the answer starts with the specific model. Ooni offers a range of ovens. Each one has different features and uses various fuel types. These differences affect the price. Knowing the models helps you understand the initial cost.

### Ooni Fyra 12: The Portable Pellet Powerhouse

## Beyond the Base: Essential Ooni Accessories and Their Costs

Buying the Ooni pizza oven itself is only the first step. To get the best experience, you will need several accessories. These items enhance your cooking process and help maintain your oven. They add to the total cost. Thinking about these upfront helps you budget properly.

### Pizza Peels: A Must-Have Tool

A pizza peel is essential for launching and retrieving pizzas. Ooni offers several types.
*   **Perforated Pizza Peels:** These are common. They allow excess flour to fall off the dough. This prevents burning in the oven. A 12-inch perforated peel costs around **$50-$60**. A 14-inch peel might be **$60-$70**.
*   **Bamboo Pizza Peels:** These are often used for preparing the pizza. They are good for dusting with flour. They cost about **$25-$40**.
*   **Turning Peels:** These smaller, round peels help rotate pizzas inside the hot oven. This ensures even cooking. They typically cost **$30-$40**. I recommend having at least one launch peel and one turning peel.

### Covers and Carrying Bags: Protection and Portability

Protecting your Ooni oven from the elements is important.
*   **Oven Covers:** These are custom-fit. They shield your oven from rain, dust, and UV rays. A cover usually costs **$40-$60** depending on the oven model.
*   **Carrying Bags:** For portable models like the Fyra 12 or Koda 12, a carrying bag makes transport easy. These bags are durable and designed for the oven's shape. They typically cost **$40-$50**. Investing in a cover or bag extends the life of your oven.

### Infrared Thermometer: Precision Cooking

An infrared thermometer is not strictly essential but highly recommended. It allows you to measure the temperature of your pizza stone precisely. Achieving the correct stone temperature is crucial for a perfect crust. An Ooni infrared thermometer costs around **$40-$50**. This tool helps you cook consistently delicious pizzas. It removes the guesswork from heating. You will use it every time you cook.

### Cleaning Brushes: Maintaining Your Oven

Keeping your Ooni oven clean is important for performance and longevity.
*   **Oven Brush/Scraper:** This tool has sturdy bristles to clean the stone and a scraper for stubborn bits. Ooni's brush typically costs around **$20-$25**. Regular cleaning prevents buildup. It helps your oven run efficiently.

### Fuel-Specific Accessories: Extra Tanks and Connectors

If you choose a gas Ooni, you will need a propane tank. A standard 20 lb propane tank costs about **$40-$60** to purchase new. Filling it costs **$15-$25**. Some ovens, like the Karu 12, might need a gas burner attachment if you want to use gas fuel. This accessory costs an additional **$70-$80**. If you are wondering about the initial setup, you might find it helpful to read [how to put Ooni pizza oven together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-ooni-pizza-oven-together) to see what is involved. You can also explore options like [can you use pizza pan in Ooni pizza oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-pizza-pan-in-ooni-pizza-oven) for specific cooking needs.

Adding up these essential accessories, you can expect to spend an extra **$100 to $300** beyond the oven's base price. This range depends on which accessories you choose and what type of oven you have. Planning for these costs helps avoid surprises.

## Fueling Your Ooni: Estimating Running Costs

Once you own an Ooni pizza oven and its accessories, you need to consider the ongoing cost of fuel. This cost varies significantly based on the type of Ooni oven you own and how often you use it. Understanding these running costs helps you budget for your long-term pizza-making adventures.

### Propane Gas Ovens (Ooni Koda, Karu with Gas Burner)

Propane is a popular fuel choice due to its convenience. A standard 20 lb propane tank can typically fuel your Ooni oven for **10-15 hours of continuous use**.
*   **Cost per tank:** Refilling a 20 lb propane tank usually costs between **$15 and $25**.
*   **Usage:** If you cook pizza for 1-2 hours once a week, a single tank could last for 2-3 months.
*   **Efficiency:** Gas ovens heat up fast, which means less fuel wasted during preheating. They maintain a consistent temperature easily.

Propane offers great control and a clean burn. It is often seen as a simple, cost-effective fuel source for regular use. To learn more about gas options, see [what gas does Ooni pizza oven use](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-gas-does-ooni-pizza-oven-use).

### Wood Pellet Ovens (Ooni Fyra)

Wood pellets provide an authentic wood-fired flavor. They are compact and easy to store.
*   **Cost per bag:** A 20 lb bag of Ooni Premium Hardwood Pellets costs around **$20-$30**.
*   **Usage:** This 20 lb bag can fuel your Ooni Fyra for about **2-3 hours of continuous cooking**. This means you might use half a bag or more for a single pizza party.
*   **Efficiency:** Pellet ovens require more active management of fuel. You need to keep feeding pellets into the hopper. The burn rate can be higher compared to gas.

Pellets offer a unique taste profile. Their cost adds up faster if you cook for long periods or very frequently. Knowing [how to light an Ooni pizza oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-light-an-ooni-pizza-oven) properly helps optimize fuel consumption for pellet ovens.

### Wood/Charcoal Ovens (Ooni Karu Series)

The multi-fuel Karu ovens can use wood splits or charcoal. This allows for a traditional wood-fired experience.
*   **Cost of wood/charcoal:** This varies widely. Buying kiln-dried hardwood splits (like oak or hickory) can cost **$50-$100** for a bundle that lasts several sessions. A bag of high-quality lump charcoal costs **$20-$30**.
*   **Usage:** Wood and charcoal burn hotter and faster than pellets. You will need a constant supply to maintain high temperatures.
*   **Efficiency:** Using wood and charcoal requires more attention. You need to feed small pieces regularly. It offers an intense flavor. It can be more expensive per hour of cooking compared to propane. However, for authentic wood-fired taste, it is the only way.

### Electric Ovens (Ooni Volt 12)

The Ooni Volt 12 uses electricity. This eliminates the need for purchasing and storing fuel.
*   **Cost:** The cost depends on your local electricity rates. The Volt 12 has a power rating of 1600 Watts (1.6 kW).
*   **Calculation:** If your electricity costs $0.15 per kWh, running the Volt 12 for one hour would cost 1.6 kW * $0.15/kWh = **$0.24**.
*   **Usage:** Even with preheating, the electric cost per pizza session is usually very low, often less than a dollar.

The electric Ooni Volt has the lowest running cost per use. It is also the most convenient as you just plug it in. This makes it a great choice for those who prioritize ease of use and consistent, low ongoing expenses.

Overall, your running costs will depend on your chosen fuel type and how often you fire up your Ooni. Propane offers a good balance of convenience and moderate cost. Wood pellets and wood/charcoal offer flavor but may have higher per-use costs. Electricity offers the ultimate convenience and lowest running cost.

## Additional Expenses and Long-Term Investment in Your Ooni

Beyond the oven and basic accessories, there are other potential expenses to consider. These factors contribute to the total cost of owning an Ooni pizza oven. Thinking about them now helps you set a realistic budget. It ensures you have everything needed for a great pizza-making setup.

### Setup Considerations: Surface and Stability

Your Ooni pizza oven needs a stable, heat-resistant surface.
*   **Existing Outdoor Table:** If you have a suitable table, this cost is zero. Ensure it is sturdy and can handle the oven's weight and heat.
*   **New Outdoor Table/Cart:** If you need a new surface, prices vary. A basic outdoor metal or stone table might cost **$100-$300**. Ooni also sells modular tables specifically designed for their ovens. These tables are durable and offer storage. They can range from **$250-$400**. An outdoor kitchen island or counter will be much more expensive, possibly thousands of dollars. Always check [what can I put my Ooni pizza oven on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-can-i-put-my-ooni-pizza-oven-on) to ensure safety and stability for your setup.
*   **Safety:** Ensure the surface is non-combustible and can withstand high temperatures. Proper ventilation is also key.

### Maintenance and Replacement Parts

Ooni ovens are built to last, but some parts may need attention over time.
*   **Pizza Stone:** The cordierite pizza stone is durable but can crack if thermal shocked or dropped. A replacement stone typically costs **$40-$70**, depending on the oven size.
*   **General Cleaning Supplies:** Beyond the Ooni brush, you might need heat-resistant gloves (**$20-$30**) and simple cleaning cloths.
*   **Propane Hose/Regulator:** These are generally long-lasting but could need replacement eventually. Ooni sells replacement kits for around **$30-$50**.

Regular cleaning and proper care can extend the life of all components. This reduces the need for frequent replacements.

### Pizza Ingredients Cost: The Ongoing Food Bill

This is an ongoing cost that varies greatly. Homemade pizza can be cheaper than takeout, but quality ingredients add up.
*   **Dough:** You can make your own dough for pennies. Buying pre-made dough balls costs **$2-$5 each**.
*   **Sauce and Cheese:** A can of good quality crushed tomatoes for sauce is **$2-$4**. A pound of mozzarella cheese costs **$5-$10**.
*   **Toppings:** Pepperoni, vegetables, specialty meats, and cheeses add varying amounts to the cost. A typical 12-inch pizza with moderate toppings might cost **$4-$8** to make at home.
*   **Comparison to Takeout:** A single gourmet pizza from a restaurant can cost **$18-$30**. Making several pizzas at home with your Ooni is often much more economical per pizza.

### Comparing Ooni to Other Pizza Oven Options

The Ooni pizza oven price sits in the mid-range for outdoor pizza ovens.
*   **Entry-Level Ovens:** Some portable ovens are available for **$150-$300**. These often offer less consistent heat or smaller cooking areas.
*   **High-End Portable Ovens:** Brands like Gozney offer ovens starting at **$800-$1,500**. These might feature different designs or materials.
*   **Built-In Outdoor Pizza Ovens:** Constructing a permanent brick or stone pizza oven can cost **$2,000-$10,000+** including materials and labor. These are a major home improvement project.

An Ooni provides a great balance of performance, portability, and value. It offers near-professional results without the massive investment or permanent installation of a traditional outdoor oven. Considering these additional expenses helps you plan for the full cost of ownership. It goes beyond just the initial purchase of the Ooni pizza oven itself.
