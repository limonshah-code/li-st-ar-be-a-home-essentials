## Finding Your Bosch Dishwasher Model Number: A Complete Guide

Your Bosch dishwasher is an essential part of your kitchen. Sometimes, you need specific information about it. This information includes the model number. Finding your Bosch dishwasher model number is a common task.

It is necessary for many reasons. You might need it for repairs or to order new parts. You might also need it to register your appliance. This guide will help you locate the model number. I will show you the most common places to look. You will learn simple steps to find this important detail.

### Takeaway

*   Check inside the dishwasher door frame.
*   Look on the side of the dishwasher door panel.
*   Inspect behind the kickplate at the bottom.
*   Consider the back of the unit if other spots fail.
*   Keep original documents or manuals handy.

### The Quick Answer

You can find the Bosch dishwasher model number on a sticker or data plate. This label is usually inside the dishwasher. Look on the door frame or the side edge of the door. It may also be behind the kickplate.

## Why Your Bosch Dishwasher Model Number Matters

Knowing your Bosch dishwasher model number is more important than you might think. This specific code unlocks a lot of vital information. It helps you get the right service and parts for your appliance. Without it, you might order the wrong components.

The model number identifies your dishwasher's exact configuration. It tells technicians what specific features and parts your unit has. This helps them diagnose issues accurately. It also ensures they bring the correct tools or replacement parts. I always stress the importance of this number.

You will need the model number for warranty claims. It is also necessary for product registration. Having it ready saves you time and frustration. It helps you keep your dishwasher running smoothly.

### Understanding the Data Plate

The model number appears on a data plate or sticker. This label includes other important details. It shows the serial number, which tracks the specific unit's production. The data plate also lists electrical requirements.

You might see manufacturing dates or certifications. All these details are crucial. They ensure proper maintenance and safety. Always refer to this plate when you need appliance information.

### Model vs. Serial Number

People often confuse the model number with the serial number. They are different. The model number identifies the *type* of dishwasher. It applies to all units of that specific design. The serial number identifies *your unique unit*.

Think of it like this: "Bosch XYZ model" is the model number. It is the same for thousands of dishwashers. "Serial #12345" is your specific dishwasher. This number tracks its manufacturing history. You will need both for some purposes. For parts ordering, the model number is usually primary.

## The Most Common Spot: Inside the Dishwasher Door

The easiest place to find your Bosch dishwasher model number is usually inside the door. Most Bosch models place a label on the door frame. This is a very convenient spot. I always check here first.

You do not need to move the appliance. You also do not need tools. This makes it a great starting point for anyone. It is designed to be easily accessible for owners.

To find it, simply open your dishwasher door all the way. Look along the top edge of the door. Also check the sides of the inner door frame. The sticker is often on the right or left side. Sometimes, it is on the very top edge.

### Tips for Locating the Sticker

The sticker might be hard to see. It can fade over time. It can also get dirty. Here are some simple tips. First, use a flashlight. This helps illuminate the area. Next, wipe the area clean. Use a damp cloth to remove any grime. This makes the text clearer.

The label is usually white or silver. It has black text. The model number often starts with letters. It is followed by numbers. For example, it might look like "SHX3AR75UC/01" or "SGE53U55UC". It is usually near a barcode.

Take a photo of the label with your phone. This is a smart idea. You will have the numbers saved. You can refer to them later without going back to the dishwasher. This saves you time when talking to customer service or ordering parts. Many other dishwasher brands use similar locations. For example, [finding your LG dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-lg-dishwasher-model-number) often involves checking the door, as does [finding your Samsung dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-samsung-dishwasher-model-number). These common locations make it easier for consumers to locate important information across various appliance brands.

## Exploring the Side of the Dishwasher Door Panel

While the inner frame is common, some Bosch dishwashers place the label on the side of the door panel itself. This spot is still inside the door. However, it requires a slightly different angle to view. It is still an easy place to check.

This location is often chosen for dishwashers with specific design features. These features might include a flush interior. The side of the door panel offers a flat surface for the sticker. It keeps the sticker protected from everyday wear. It also keeps it out of sight when the door is closed.

To check this area, open the dishwasher door completely. Look along the outer edge of the dishwasher door. This means the part of the door that meets the main dishwasher frame when closed. The sticker can be on the left or right side. Run your hand along the edge if you cannot see it immediately.

### What to Expect on the Side Panel

The label on the side panel looks similar to the one on the inner frame. It is a small sticker or plate. It contains the model and serial numbers. It might also show electrical information. The text might be small. This is why good lighting helps.

Sometimes, a clear plastic film covers the label. This film protects the label from water and food spills. However, over many years, this film can become cloudy. It can make the numbers harder to read. Gently cleaning the film can help.

If your sticker is faded, try using a strong light at an angle. Sometimes, the numbers become visible with the right lighting. You can also try taking a picture with your phone's flash on. The flash might reveal text that is hard to see with the naked eye. This location is also common for other appliance types. For instance, you might find the model number for a [Bosch refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-bosch-refrigerator-model-number) or a [Bosch washing machine model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-bosch-washing-machine-model-number) in similar side or interior locations, depending on the appliance.

## Behind the Kickplate: A Hidden Location

If you have checked the door and its edges without success, the next place to look is behind the kickplate. The kickplate is the decorative panel at the very bottom front of your dishwasher. It often matches your kitchen cabinets. This spot is less common but still used by Bosch.

Accessing this location requires a bit more effort. You will need to remove the kickplate. Do not worry; it is usually a simple process. It does not damage your dishwasher. This location protects the label well. It keeps it safe from spills and daily wear.

Before you start, ensure the dishwasher is unplugged. Safety is always important. Pull the dishwasher away from the wall slightly if it is built-in. This gives you more room to work. You might need a screwdriver for this step.

### How to Remove the Kickplate

Most kickplates are held in place by two or three screws. These screws are usually visible at the bottom corners. Find these screws. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove them. Keep the screws in a safe place.

Once the screws are out, the kickplate should slide or pull away easily. It might be snug. Do not force it. Gently pull it forward. Set the kickplate aside in a safe spot.

Now, look at the base of the dishwasher. The label is typically on the front frame. It can be on the left or right side of the frame. It might be on a metal bracket. Use your flashlight to see into the dark space. The sticker will be similar to those found on the door. It will contain the model and serial numbers.

After you find the numbers, replace the kickplate. Align the screw holes. Insert and tighten the screws. Make sure the kickplate is secure. This process is very similar to how you might find the model number for other appliances with hidden panels, such as a [KitchenAid dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-kitchenaid-dishwasher-model-number) or a [Maytag dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-maytag-dishwasher-model-number). The principle of removing a front panel to access internal labels is common across many brands.

## The Back of the Dishwasher: A Last Resort

Sometimes, the model number sticker is not in any of the common places. If you have checked the door and the kickplate, you might need to look on the back of the dishwasher. This is typically the least convenient location. It should be your last resort.

Bosch usually puts the label in an easily accessible place. However, for some older models or specific installations, the label might be on the rear. This location protects the label very well from kitchen elements. But it makes accessing the information difficult.

Accessing the back of a built-in dishwasher can be challenging. It might require pulling the entire appliance out from its cabinet. This is a heavy task. It often requires two people. It also means disconnecting water lines and power.

### Safety First When Checking the Back

Before you even think about moving your dishwasher, prioritize safety. First, turn off the power to the dishwasher at the circuit breaker. This prevents electric shock. Next, turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. The water shut-off valve is usually under the sink.

Then, disconnect the water inlet hose and the drain hose. Use towels to catch any residual water. Carefully slide the dishwasher out from its cabinet. Some dishwashers have adjustable feet that can get caught.

Once the dishwasher is out, look on the back panel. The sticker is usually on the upper part. It might be on the side of the back. It looks like the other labels. It contains the model and serial numbers. This is a very rare place for Bosch. However, it is possible for some models. After you find the numbers, reconnect everything carefully. Make sure there are no leaks before turning the water and power back on.

## Other Ways to Locate Your Bosch Model Information

What if you have tried all the physical locations on your Bosch dishwasher and still cannot find the model number? Do not worry. There are still other avenues to explore. Sometimes, the label fades completely. Other times, it might have been removed during an old repair.

These alternative methods can save you a lot of searching. They rely on external sources of information. They can be very helpful when the direct approach fails. I always recommend keeping original appliance documents. They often contain this crucial data.

These methods also highlight the importance of digital resources. Manufacturers offer more support online. Having your purchase details ready can speed up the process. This is true for all appliance brands.

### Original Purchase Documents and Manuals

The first place to check outside of the dishwasher itself is your original paperwork. When you bought your Bosch dishwasher, it came with documents. These include a sales receipt or invoice. They also include an owner's manual.

*   **Sales Receipt/Invoice:** Your sales receipt or invoice usually lists the model number. It is important for warranty purposes too. Check the item description on your receipt.
*   **Owner's Manual:** The owner's manual almost always has the model number printed on the front cover. It can also be found on one of the initial pages. Keep these manuals in a safe, accessible place.

### Bosch Home Connect App

If your Bosch dishwasher is a newer, smart model, you might have it connected to the Bosch Home Connect app. This app lets you control your appliance remotely. It also stores important product information.

Open the Home Connect app on your smartphone or tablet. Go to the section for your dishwasher. The app often displays the model number directly. This is a very convenient digital solution. It removes the need for physical searching.

### Contact Bosch Customer Support

If all else fails, contact Bosch customer support. They can help you. You will need to provide them with as much information as possible. Tell them when and where you bought the dishwasher. Describe its appearance.

They might be able to find your model number using your purchase date or your registration details. They can also often identify models from specific features. Have a pen and paper ready to write down the numbers they give you. This method is effective when direct identification is impossible.

## Decoding the Bosch Model and Serial Numbers

Once you find your Bosch dishwasher model number, it might look like a jumble of letters and numbers. But these characters are not random. They contain specific information about your appliance. Understanding this code helps you get the right parts or service.

Bosch uses a consistent naming system. This system identifies product lines, features, and sometimes the color or region. Decoding it can give you a deeper understanding of your specific dishwasher. The serial number also holds important data. It tells you the manufacturing date.

Learning to read these numbers is a valuable skill for any appliance owner. It ensures accuracy when communicating with technicians. It also helps when looking up parts online. I find it very empowering to understand these codes.

### What the Model Number Means

A typical Bosch dishwasher model number might look like "SHPM78Z55N".
Let's break down a common Bosch model number structure:

*   **First letters (e.g., SHP, SHE, SHX, SGE):** These usually indicate the dishwasher series or design type.
    *   `SHP`: Often indicates a recessed handle.
    *   `SHE`: Can indicate a bar handle.
    *   `SHX`: Might denote a pocket handle or specific panel-ready features.
    *   `SGE`: Often refers to portable or compact models.
*   **Numbers after letters (e.g., M78, 53U):** These numbers generally relate to the feature level or capacity. Higher numbers often mean more advanced features, better efficiency, or larger capacity.
*   **Next characters (e.g., Z55, G55):** These might indicate specific feature sets, control types, or internal configurations.
*   **Last letter (e.g., N, C):** This usually signifies the color or finish.
    *   `N`: Stainless Steel
    *   `C`: Black
    *   `W`: White
*   **Suffix (e.g., /01, /02):** This indicates a revision number. It is important for parts. A revision number changes if Bosch makes a minor design change during production. Make sure to note this revision number.

When ordering parts, always provide the full model number. Include any revision numbers. This ensures you receive the correct component that matches your exact dishwasher.

### The Serial Number and Manufacturing Date

The serial number is a unique identifier for your specific dishwasher. It is usually a longer string of numbers. Bosch serial numbers often contain information about the manufacturing date.

For many Bosch appliances, the manufacturing date is embedded in the serial number. The first four digits often represent the week and year of manufacture. For example, a serial number starting with "4215" would mean the 42nd week of 2015. This information is useful for warranty tracking and understanding your appliance's age. For similar information on other brands, you can consult guides like [how to find the Miele dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-miele-dishwasher-model-number) or [how to find the Whirlpool refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-your-whirlpool-refrigerator-model-number), as many manufacturers embed dates or production details within their serial numbers.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Bosch Dishwasher Model Numbers

### Q1: What is the main difference between a Bosch model number and serial number?
The model number identifies the specific *type* or *design series* of your Bosch dishwasher. All units of that particular model share the same model number. The serial number, however, is a *unique identifier* for your individual appliance, much like a VIN for a car. It tracks production specifics and manufacturing date.

### Q2: Can I find my Bosch dishwasher model number online if the label is gone?
Yes, it might be possible. If you registered your appliance, check your Bosch online account. You can also search for your purchase receipt in your email. If you bought it from a large retailer, they might have your purchase history. Providing details like the purchase date can help Bosch customer service find it.

### Q3: What should I do if the model number sticker is faded or unreadable?
First, try cleaning the area gently with a damp cloth. Use a flashlight or your phone's camera flash to try and make the numbers visible. Take multiple photos from different angles. If it's still unreadable, check your owner's manual or purchase receipts. Contacting Bosch customer support with your appliance's age and unique features is also a good step.

### Q4: Why does Bosch place the model number sticker in different spots?
Bosch might use different locations for several reasons. These include specific design variations of the dishwasher models. Some placements protect the label better. Other placements offer easier access depending on the unit's installation. Changes in manufacturing processes or regional requirements can also influence the label's location.

### Q5: Is the model number ever located on the front panel of the dishwasher?
It is very rare for the full model number to be on the visible front panel of a Bosch dishwasher. The front panel is usually for aesthetics. Sometimes, a series name might be there, like "Bosch 800 Series." However, the complete model number, which includes letters and numbers, is typically on the hidden data plate inside the door or behind the kickplate.

### Q6: How often do Bosch model numbers change for new dishwashers?
Bosch updates its model numbers with new product lines or significant design changes. This happens periodically, usually every few years or when new technology is introduced. Minor revisions might only change the suffix or a few digits. Keeping your model number recorded is vital, regardless of how often they change.
