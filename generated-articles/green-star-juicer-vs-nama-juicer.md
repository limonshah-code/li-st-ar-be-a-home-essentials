### Understanding Masticating Juicers: The Core Technology

Masticating juicers operate at a slow speed. They crush and press produce. This process extracts juice efficiently. It minimizes heat buildup and oxidation. This keeps more vitamins and enzymes in your juice. Many people call these "cold press juicers" for this reason.

#### How Masticating Juicers Work

Masticating juicers use an auger, or a set of gears, to chew through fruits and vegetables. The slow rotation grinds the produce. It squeezes out the liquid. The pulp comes out separately, often very dry. This slow action is key to preserving nutrients. It makes a vibrant, delicious juice.

#### Benefits of Slow Juicing

Slow juicing offers many benefits. It produces juice with less foam. The juice lasts longer in the fridge, usually up to 72 hours. This is because less oxygen mixes with the juice. The low heat protects delicate nutrients. You get a higher quality, more beneficial drink. Masticating juicers are known for their efficiency. They extract more juice from your ingredients.

### Green Star Juicer: A Legacy of Twin Gear Power

The Green Star Juicer, especially the Elite model, is famous in the juicing world. It uses twin gears to get juice from produce. These gears are powerful. They work together to crush ingredients. Many serious juicers choose Green Star. They value its juice quality and yield.

#### Green Star's Twin Gear Mechanism

Green Star juicers feature advanced twin gears. These gears are made of stainless steel. They rotate close together. This creates a powerful crushing and pressing action. The gears also contain special magnetic and bio-ceramic technology. This technology helps to extract more minerals. It also keeps enzymes fresh. You get juice that is rich in flavor and nutrients. This system processes even the toughest greens.

This helps maintain nutrient integrity. The Nama J2 is a game-changer for many. Its design simplifies the juicing process. You can place whole or large pieces of fruit into the hopper. The juicer does the work.

#### Auto-Assembly and Self-Feeding

One of Nama's biggest selling points is its auto-assembly hopper. You load ingredients into the top chamber. The juicer pulls them down automatically. This means less chopping for you.

Green Star juicers excel with leafy greens. Their twin gears are very efficient. They squeeze out nearly every drop of juice. You will get very dry pulp from spinach, kale, and wheatgrass.
