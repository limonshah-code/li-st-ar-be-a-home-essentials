Your ADT doorbell relies heavily on your home Wi-Fi network. It needs a stable internet connection to send alerts and stream video. A blinking red light frequently signals a problem with this connection. Understanding your Wi-Fi setup helps diagnose these issues.

I know how frustrating a dropped connection can be. It stops your smart devices from working as they should. For an ADT doorbell, a poor Wi-Fi signal means it cannot communicate. Let's look at common network-related causes.

### Weak Wi-Fi Signal Strength

If your doorbell is too far from your Wi-Fi router, the signal might be weak. Walls, floors, and other electronic devices can interfere. A weak signal makes it hard for the doorbell to maintain a stable connection. This often results in a blinking red light.

Consider moving your router closer to the doorbell if possible. Or, use a Wi-Fi extender or mesh system. These devices boost your Wi-Fi signal. They help ensure strong coverage for your doorbell. A stronger signal often resolves connectivity issues.

### Router Issues or Internet Outages

Your internet router might be having issues. Sometimes, the router needs a simple reboot. Power cycling your router can clear temporary glitches. This might restore your doorbell's connection. You can also check if your internet service provider has an outage.

An internet outage means your doorbell cannot connect to ADT servers. The red light will likely blink in this situation. Once internet service resumes, your doorbell should reconnect automatically. If it doesn't, a quick reboot of the doorbell helps.

### Incorrect Wi-Fi Password or Network Changes

If you recently changed your Wi-Fi password, your doorbell will lose its connection. It will not know the new password. The same applies if you changed your network name (SSID). Your doorbell needs the updated information.

You will need to reconnect your doorbell to your Wi-Fi network using the ADT Pulse app. Go into the device settings and update the network credentials. This process is usually straightforward. It ensures your doorbell can communicate with your system again.
