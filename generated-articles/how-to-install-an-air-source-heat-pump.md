### 4. Installing the Indoor Unit (Hydro Box/Fan Coil)

The indoor unit, often called the air handler or hydro box, is just as important as the outdoor unit. It distributes the heated or cooled air throughout your home. Its proper placement and connection are essential for effective system operation. This step involves both mechanical installation and connecting the condensate drain.

#### Choosing the Indoor Unit Location

The placement of the indoor unit depends on your system type. For ducted systems, the air handler typically goes in a utility closet, basement, attic, or crawl space. It connects to your existing ductwork. Ensure there is enough space for maintenance and proper airflow around the unit. For ductless mini-split systems, indoor units mount directly on a wall or ceiling in the room they serve. Choose a location that provides good air distribution throughout the space. Avoid placing units where furniture or curtains might block airflow. Also, consider the noise level; most units are quiet, but some prefer them away from sleeping areas.

#### Connecting to the Distribution System

Once positioned, the indoor unit needs connection to your home's heat distribution system. If you have a ducted system, this means connecting to the main return and supply ducts. Ensure airtight seals to prevent energy loss. For mini-split systems, the indoor unit connects directly to the outdoor unit via refrigerant lines and electrical wiring, which run through a small hole in the wall. If your air source heat pump is a hydronic type, the indoor unit connects to your hot water pipes for radiators or underfloor heating. It's helpful to understand if [can you use an air source heat pump with radiators](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-an-air-source-heat-pump-with-radiators) as it influences the indoor setup.
