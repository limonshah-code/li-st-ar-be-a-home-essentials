### Clear Answer: Does LG Refrigerator Use Freon?

No, modern LG refrigerators do not use Freon. LG, like other major appliance manufacturers, stopped using Freon (specifically CFCs and HCFCs like R-12 and R-22) decades ago. Today, LG refrigerators use environmentally safer refrigerants, primarily R-134a or R-600a, which do not deplete the ozone layer and have lower global warming potential.

## The Evolution of Refrigerants: From Freon to Modern Alternatives

Refrigeration technology has seen big changes over time. Early refrigerators used highly toxic or flammable chemicals. Ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and methyl chloride were common. These chemicals were dangerous if a leak occurred. In the 1920s and 1930s, scientists sought safer alternatives. They developed chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.

CFCs became popular due to their stability and non-flammability. DuPont marketed these chemicals under the brand name "Freon." Freon became a household name for refrigerants. It made refrigerators and air conditioners much safer. However, a major environmental problem emerged later. These CFCs were very stable. They could reach the Earth's stratosphere. Here, they broke down ozone molecules. The ozone layer protects Earth from harmful UV radiation.

### The Problem with Freon and the Ozone Layer

Scientists discovered the link between CFCs and ozone depletion in the 1970s. This finding caused global concern. The ozone hole over Antarctica became a clear sign of damage. Governments and environmental groups took action. They knew they needed to phase out CFCs. This led to the Montreal Protocol in 1987. This international treaty aimed to reduce and eliminate ozone-depleting substances.

Following CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) like R-22 were used. HCFCs were less harmful than CFCs but still damaged the ozone layer. They were considered transitional substances. The industry then moved to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). HFCs, such as R-134a, do not contain chlorine. This means they do not harm the ozone layer. This was a significant step forward in refrigerant technology.

### The Shift to HFCs and Beyond

The shift to HFCs was a major change for appliance makers. Companies like LG embraced these new refrigerants. HFCs became the standard for many years.
