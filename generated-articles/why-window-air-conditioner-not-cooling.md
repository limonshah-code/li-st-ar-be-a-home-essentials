A window air conditioner stops cooling for several reasons. These include a dirty air filter, frozen evaporator coils, low refrigerant, or a faulty compressor. Power supply issues and incorrect thermostat settings also prevent cooling. Checking these parts helps identify the problem. You can often fix common issues yourself with simple maintenance tasks.

### Dirty Air Filter Blocks Cooling Airflow

One of the most common reasons a window air conditioner not cooling is a dirty air filter. The filter traps dust, pet dander, and other particles. Over time, these particles build up. A clogged filter restricts airflow over the evaporator coils. This reduced airflow stops the unit from cooling your room effectively.

I have seen many AC units struggling because of this simple issue. It is easy to overlook filter cleaning. The unit works harder but produces no cold air. This also raises your energy bill. A dirty filter can cause the coils to freeze, creating a bigger problem.

**How to Fix a Dirty Air Filter:**

### Frozen Evaporator Coils Stop Cold Air Production

Frozen evaporator coils are a significant reason a window air conditioner not cooling. The evaporator coils absorb heat from your room's air. If these coils get too cold or air cannot move over them, moisture in the air turns to ice. This ice buildup acts as an insulator. It prevents the coils from absorbing heat.

When ice covers the coils, the AC cannot cool the air. You might feel warm air coming out. Sometimes, you see water dripping from the unit. This water comes from melting ice. A frozen coil often results from a dirty air filter. It can also happen due to low refrigerant or a faulty fan.

**Steps to Defrost Frozen Coils:**

1.  **Turn off the AC:** Switch the unit off completely. Unplug it from the wall for safety.
2.  **Allow to melt:** Let the ice melt naturally. This can take several hours, even overnight. You can place towels around the unit to catch water.
3.  **Speed up melting (optional):** You can use a fan to blow room temperature air onto the coils. Avoid using a hairdryer or sharp objects. These can damage the coils.
4.  **Address the cause:** Once defrosted, identify the underlying issue. Clean your air filter if it is dirty. Ensure no vents are blocked.
5.  **Restart the unit:** Plug the AC back in and turn it on. Monitor its performance.

If coils freeze repeatedly, it suggests a more serious issue. This could be a low refrigerant level. Or it could be a fan problem. Repeated freezing needs professional help.

### Drainage Issues and Water Leaks

While not directly stopping the cooling process, drainage issues and water leaks can indicate or cause problems that lead to your window air conditioner not cooling properly. Window AC units produce condensation as they remove humidity from the air. This water normally drains out through a drain pan and a small hole at the back of the unit.

If this drain system gets clogged, water builds up in the pan. This can lead to various problems. Water can spill into your room, causing damage. More importantly, excessive water can cause the coils to freeze more easily. Standing water in the unit can also lead to mold and mildew growth. This can make your AC smell bad.

**Troubleshooting Drainage Issues:**

1.  **Check the drain pan:** Look inside the unit for standing water in the drain pan. It should be mostly dry.
2.  **Clear the drain hole:** Locate the small drain hole at the bottom of the outer casing. Use a thin wire or pipe cleaner to clear any clogs.
