## Operating Costs and Fuel Consumption

Once your gas stove is installed, you face the ongoing operating costs. These costs relate to the natural gas or propane you use. Gas stoves are generally known for being energy-efficient. Their operating costs can be lower than electric counterparts.

The total cost depends on how much you cook. It also depends on the local price of gas. Gas prices can fluctuate, impacting your monthly utility bills. Understanding these factors helps you budget for long-term use.

### Natural Gas vs. Propane: Fuel Type Differences

Gas stoves can run on either natural gas or propane (LP gas). The type of fuel significantly impacts your operating costs. Stoves are typically set up for natural gas from the factory. They come with a conversion kit for propane if needed.

*   **Natural Gas:** This is the most common choice for homes with a municipal gas line. Natural gas is usually cheaper per therm (unit of energy) than propane. It comes directly into your home through underground pipes. You pay a monthly bill based on your usage.
*   **Propane (LP Gas):** Homes without natural gas access use propane. This requires a large storage tank on your property. You purchase propane in bulk from a supplier. Propane can be more expensive than natural gas. Its price can also fluctuate more widely.

### Calculating Your Gas Stove's Energy Use

Estimating your gas stove's energy consumption helps you predict costs. Gas appliance consumption is measured in British Thermal Units (BTUs). A higher BTU rating means more energy use when operating. Ovens also have BTU ratings.

To estimate consumption:

*   Find the BTU rating of your burners and oven. This information is in the stove's specifications.
*   An average burner uses about 7,000-10,000 BTUs per hour on medium heat. A high-power burner might use 15,000-20,000 BTUs.
*   An oven might use 15,000-20,000 BTUs per hour.
*   Natural gas is usually priced per therm (1 therm = 100,000 BTUs). Propane is priced per gallon (1 gallon propane = 91,500 BTUs).
*   Multiply the appliance's BTU rating by the hours of use. Then, divide by the BTU per therm or gallon. This gives you the energy consumed.
*   Finally, multiply by your local gas price.

For example, if your oven is 20,000 BTUs and you use it for 1 hour, that's 0.2 therms (20,000 / 100,000). If natural gas costs $1.50 per therm, that hour of oven use costs $0.30. For more precise figures, you can check out [how much a gas oven costs per hour](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-does-gas-oven-cost-per-hour).

### Factors Influencing Operating Costs

Your actual operating costs depend on several variables. These include:

*   **Usage Frequency:** The more you cook, the more gas you use. A family that cooks every meal at home will have higher costs than someone who eats out often.
*   **Cooking Habits:** Using high heat or baking for long periods consumes more gas. Simmering on low heat uses less.
*   **Local Gas Prices:** Gas prices vary significantly by region and season. Check with your local utility provider for current rates. Propane prices are also dynamic.
*   **Stove Efficiency:** While most gas stoves are efficient, newer models may have slight improvements. Features like electronic ignition (instead of a pilot light) save small amounts of gas over time.
*   **Insulation and Oven Seals:** A well-maintained oven with good door seals retains heat better. This reduces the energy needed to maintain temperature. Poor seals can lead to higher gas consumption.

While the upfront cost of gas stoves can be notable, their operating efficiency often results in lower utility bills compared to some electric models. This contributes to their appeal for many homeowners.
