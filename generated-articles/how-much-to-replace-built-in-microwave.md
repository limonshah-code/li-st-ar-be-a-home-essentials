## How Much To Replace Built In Microwave: Your Comprehensive Cost Guide

Replacing a built-in microwave can feel like a big decision. You might wonder about the specific costs involved. I know this because I have faced the same question many times. Understanding the total expense helps you plan your budget. This article gives you a clear picture of how much to replace a built-in microwave.

We will break down every cost component. We look at the appliance itself and professional installation fees. We also cover factors that change your total price. This guide helps you make an informed decision for your kitchen upgrade. Let's explore the financial aspects of this home improvement project together.

### Takeaway

Replacing your built-in microwave involves several costs. Keep these key points in mind:

### Understanding the Core Costs: Microwave Unit Price

The primary cost of replacing your built-in microwave is the appliance itself. Microwave prices vary widely. Basic models cost less. High-end units with advanced features cost more. I have seen this difference myself when shopping.

Entry-level built-in microwaves might start around $200 to $400. These models offer essential cooking functions. They fit standard cabinet openings. They are a good choice for those on a tight budget. They still get the job done efficiently.

Mid-range built-in microwaves usually fall between $500 and $1,000. These units often include more features. You might find convection cooking or sensor cooking modes. They can come in different finishes, like stainless steel. These models balance cost and functionality well. Many homeowners choose microwaves in this price bracket. They offer improved performance without a huge price tag.

High-end and luxury built-in microwaves can exceed $1,000. Some premium models reach $2,000 or more. These appliances offer extensive features. They may have advanced cooking presets, smart home connectivity, or professional designs. Brands like Thermador or Miele fall into this category. They are often part of a complete kitchen renovation. People choose them for their sleek appearance and superior performance. Consider your budget and cooking needs when choosing. Do not pay for features you will never use. Remember that high-end units contribute significantly to the total cost.

### Installation Expenses: DIY vs. Professional Help

Once you buy a new built-in microwave, you must install it. Installation costs can vary. You can choose to do it yourself or hire a professional. Each option has different costs and considerations. My own experience shows professional help is sometimes worth the money.

#### Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Installation

Installing a built-in microwave yourself can save money on labor. Many people with basic home improvement skills can do this task. You will need standard tools. These include screwdrivers, a drill, and a level. The main costs here are your time and any new tools you might need.

The process often involves disconnecting the old unit. Then you slide out the old microwave. You slide in the new one and connect it. Ensure the new microwave fits the existing opening. An exact fit makes DIY installation much easier. If you are unsure how to remove your old unit, a guide like [How To Get Built-In Microwave Out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-built-in-microwave-out) can help. This provides step-by-step instructions.

However, DIY installation has risks. An incorrect installation can damage the unit or your cabinets. It can also create electrical hazards. If the wiring is complex, or if you need to modify the cabinet opening, professional help is often better. Do not attempt DIY if you lack confidence. Safety is always the most important thing.

#### Professional Installation

Hiring a professional for built-in microwave installation adds to the cost. However, it ensures the job gets done correctly and safely. Appliance installers or electricians usually handle these tasks. Their fees typically range from $100 to $400. This depends on your location and the complexity of the job.

The cost might include removing the old unit. They will properly dispose of it. The installer also ensures correct electrical connections. They secure the new microwave in place. This prevents any safety issues. Professionals have the tools and experience needed for a smooth installation. They also handle unexpected issues, such as minor cabinet adjustments.

Some retailers offer installation services when you buy the appliance. This can sometimes be a bundled deal. Ask about this option. It might save you money compared to hiring a separate contractor. For detailed steps on how a professional would install the appliance, you can check out [How To Install Built-In Microwave In Cabinet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-built-in-microwave-in-cabinet). This gives you an idea of the work involved.

### Factors Influencing Your Total Built-In Microwave Replacement Cost

Several factors can affect the overall cost to replace your built-in microwave. These elements go beyond the basic appliance price and installation fee. They can add unexpected expenses. Thinking about these factors helps you prepare your budget. I always consider these details when planning any appliance replacement.

#### Microwave Size and Dimensions

The size of your new microwave is crucial. Built-in microwaves come in standard widths. These typically range from 24 inches to 30 inches. However, depth and height can vary. If your new microwave matches the existing cabinet cutout, installation is simpler. This helps keep costs down.

If the new microwave is a different size, you might need cabinet modifications. This means hiring a carpenter. Cabinet modification costs can add $50 to $300 or more. This depends on the extent of the work. Sometimes, a trim kit can help bridge small gaps. Trim kits usually cost $50 to $200. Always measure your existing opening carefully before buying a new unit. Take measurements of both the width and height.

#### Required Electrical Work

Built-in microwaves need a dedicated electrical outlet. Most homes have this already. However, older homes or homes with previous countertop microwave setups might not. If your electrical system needs an upgrade, it adds to the cost. An electrician may need to install a new circuit or outlet.

Electrical work can range from $100 to $500 or more. This depends on the complexity. It involves running new wiring. It might involve adding a new breaker to your electrical panel. Always hire a licensed electrician for this type of work. This ensures safety and compliance with local codes. Do not risk electrical fires or damage.

#### Removal and Disposal of the Old Unit

You must remove your old built-in microwave before installing the new one. This task is part of the replacement process. Some appliance installers include old unit removal in their service fee. Others charge extra for it. I have seen both scenarios.

If you handle removal yourself, it saves money. You must know how to safely disconnect and pull the unit out. You then need to dispose of it. Some local recycling centers accept old appliances for free. Others charge a small fee. For detailed steps on how to remove your old unit, you can look at resources like [How To Remove Built-In Microwave From Cabinet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-built-in-microwave-from-cabinet). This guide can walk you through the process.

Professional removal and disposal typically cost $25 to $100. This convenience means you do not have to lift heavy appliances or find a disposal site. Consider if this added cost is worth your peace of mind.

#### Brand and Features

The brand of the microwave significantly impacts the price. Well-known brands often cost more. They usually offer better warranties and customer support. Luxury brands have higher prices. They provide premium materials and advanced technology.

Features also drive up the cost. Basic microwaves offer simple heating. More advanced models include convection baking, sensor cooking, or smart home connectivity. Some have specific defrosting programs, like those for a Bosch built-in microwave. These extra features make cooking easier. However, they add to the unit's price. Decide which features you truly need. Avoid paying for features you will not use. This helps manage your budget effectively.

### Repairing vs. Replacing Your Built-In Microwave: A Cost-Benefit Analysis

When your built-in microwave stops working, you have two main choices. You can repair it or replace it. Deciding which path to take involves a careful cost-benefit analysis. I always weigh these options to find the best solution. Sometimes a repair is simple and cheap. Other times, replacement makes more sense.

#### When to Consider Repair

Repairing your microwave can be a good option if the problem is minor. Common issues include a broken light bulb or a malfunctioning turntable motor. These repairs are often inexpensive. You can find replacement parts online. Sometimes, a service technician can fix it quickly.

*   **Minor Issues:** If the light bulb is out, or the door latch is loose, a repair is often the best choice. These parts are relatively cheap. Fixing them requires minimal effort.
*   **Newer Units:** If your microwave is less than five years old, consider repair. Newer appliances usually have a longer expected lifespan. A single repair can extend its life significantly.
*   **Known Problem:** If a specific part is known to fail in your model, a repair might be common. Appliance repair services can easily diagnose and fix such issues.
*   **Cost of Repair:** If the repair cost is less than half the cost of a new microwave, repair often makes sense. Get a quote from an appliance repair technician first.

However, if your microwave shows significant problems, like sparking or not heating, a repair might be costly. These issues often relate to core components. These include the magnetron or the control panel. Repairing them can be expensive. Sometimes, it approaches the price of a new unit. You can gain more insight into common issues by reading [Why Is My Built-In Microwave Not Working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-built-in-microwave-not-working). This helps you understand if a repair is feasible.

#### When to Opt for Replacement

Replacing your built-in microwave is often the better choice in several scenarios. This is especially true for older units. Newer technology offers better features and energy efficiency. I usually recommend replacement for older, failing units.

*   **Age of Appliance:** Microwaves typically last 7 to 10 years. If your unit is older than this, replacement is often more cost-effective. Older appliances tend to have more frequent breakdowns. They also become less energy-efficient over time.
*   **Major Component Failure:** If the magnetron, transformer, or control panel fails, repair costs can be very high. These parts are essential for microwave operation. The repair cost might be 70-80% of a new microwave. At that point, buying new is a better investment.
*   **Safety Concerns:** Any issue causing sparking, smoke, or a burning smell indicates a serious problem. These issues can pose a fire hazard. It is safer to replace the unit immediately. Do not risk your home's safety for a faulty appliance.
*   **Outdated Technology:** Newer microwaves offer features like sensor cooking, convection, or inverter technology. These improve cooking performance. They also save energy. Replacing an old, basic unit with a modern one can enhance your kitchen's functionality.
*   **Aesthetics and Design:** If you are updating your kitchen, an old microwave might not fit the new look. Replacing it allows you to choose a unit that matches your new appliances and decor. This improves the overall appeal of your kitchen.

Consider the total lifetime value. A new microwave comes with a warranty. It offers peace of mind. It also usually has better energy efficiency. These long-term benefits can outweigh the upfront cost of repair.

### Types of Built-In Microwaves and Their Price Points

Not all built-in microwaves are the same. Different types exist. Each type serves a specific purpose. They also come with different price points. Knowing these types helps you choose the right microwave for your needs and budget. I always advise people to understand the various options available.

#### Standard Built-In Microwaves

These are the most common type. They are designed to fit into a cabinet or wall opening. They typically come with a trim kit. This kit creates a seamless, integrated look. Standard models are usually rectangular. They have a door that opens to the side.

*   **Price Range:** $200 - $1,000
*   **Features:** Basic models offer standard microwave functions. Mid-range models may include sensor cooking or pre-set programs.
*   **Installation:** Requires a dedicated cabinet space. The trim kit is essential for the built-in appearance.

This type is ideal for most kitchens. It is a popular choice for replacements. They integrate well with existing cabinetry. They offer good functionality for everyday use.

#### Built-In Convection Microwaves

Convection microwaves combine microwave heating with convection cooking. They can bake, roast, and crisp food. This makes them more versatile than standard microwaves. They act as a secondary oven, which is a great space-saver.

*   **Price Range:** $400 - $1,500
*   **Features:** Microwave functions plus convection oven capabilities. Some have grill functions. They often offer advanced cooking modes.
*   **Installation:** Similar to standard built-in models. They might need a slightly larger ventilation space due to the heat from convection.

These are excellent for smaller kitchens. They are good for people who want extra oven space. They are also suitable for those who love to bake. The added functionality justifies the higher price for many users.

#### Microwave Drawers

Microwave drawers are a unique type of built-in microwave. They pull out like a drawer. They are installed under a countertop or in an island. This design offers easy access. It also keeps the counter space clear. These are very popular in modern kitchen designs.

*   **Price Range:** $800 - $2,000+
*   **Features:** Touch-to-open or wave-to-open functions. Many have sensor cooking. They often have child lock features.
*   **Installation:** Requires specific cabinet dimensions for drawer installation. Electrical outlets must be positioned correctly.

Microwave drawers are perfect for households with children. They are also great for those with mobility issues. They fit into a sleek kitchen design. Their higher price reflects their specialized design and convenience. They are an excellent choice if you want to maximize your counter space.

#### Over-the-Range (OTR) Microwaves (Note: While not strictly "built-in" in the cabinet sense, they are often replaced and function similarly in terms of integration)

While often considered a separate category, Over-the-Range (OTR) microwaves are worth mentioning. Many people replace them as part of a kitchen upgrade. They combine a microwave with a range hood. They mount above your stove.

*   **Price Range:** $200 - $800
*   **Features:** Microwave cooking plus ventilation for stovetop cooking. They often have multiple fan speeds and lighting.
*   **Installation:** Requires mounting to the wall studs and connecting to a vent system. This can be more complex than a standard built-in.

If your current setup includes an OTR microwave, you might replace it with another OTR model. You might also choose a true built-in and a separate range hood. The decision depends on your kitchen layout. It also depends on your ventilation needs. You can explore options like [Can Over-The-Range Microwave Be Used As Built-In](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-over-the-range-microwave-be-used-as-built-in) if you are considering alternative setups. This helps you understand the differences.

### Potential Hidden Costs and Unexpected Challenges

When planning to replace your built-in microwave, always prepare for potential hidden costs. Unexpected challenges can arise during the process. These can increase your total expense. I have seen homeowners face these issues. Being aware of them helps you budget more accurately.

#### Cabinet Modifications Beyond Simple Fitting

As mentioned earlier, cabinet modifications are a common hidden cost. Even if you measure carefully, slight differences in appliance dimensions can cause issues. A new microwave might be an inch wider or taller. This small difference can require professional carpentry work.

*   **Enlarging the Opening:** If the new microwave is slightly larger, a carpenter might need to cut the cabinet opening. This ensures a snug fit. This work can be dusty and time-consuming.
*   **Reducing the Opening:** If the new microwave is smaller, you might need to add wood trim or a custom frame. This helps fill the gap. This also needs skilled carpentry.
*   **Structural Support:** Some older cabinets might not have enough support for a heavier new microwave. Reinforcement may be needed. This adds to labor costs.

These modifications can add $50 to $300 or more to your bill. It depends on the complexity. Always inspect your cabinet thoroughly before buying a new unit. Take precise measurements multiple times.

#### Electrical System Upgrades

While we touched on this, sometimes the electrical issues are more complex than just adding an outlet. Older homes might have outdated wiring. The existing circuit might not handle the new microwave's power requirements. Modern appliances often draw more power.

*   **Dedicated Circuit:** A built-in microwave should be on its own dedicated circuit. This prevents overloading your electrical system. If you do not have one, an electrician must install it.
*   **Panel Upgrade:** In some very old homes, the electrical panel itself might need an upgrade. This happens if it cannot support new circuits. This is a significant expense, potentially thousands of dollars.
*   **Permits:** Major electrical work often requires permits. These permits ensure the work meets local building codes. Permit costs vary but can add another $50 to $200.

Always consult a licensed electrician if you suspect electrical issues. They can assess your system. They can advise you on necessary upgrades. This keeps your home safe and compliant.

#### Unexpected Damage During Removal

Removing the old built-in microwave can sometimes lead to unexpected damage. This is particularly true if the unit is old or stuck. I have seen situations where the trim or even parts of the cabinet get damaged during removal.

*   **Scratched Cabinets:** If the microwave is heavy or tightly installed, it can scratch the surrounding cabinet.
*   **Damaged Trim Kit:** The old trim kit might break during removal. This means you must buy a new one, even if your new microwave comes without one.
*   **Wall Damage:** Sometimes the mounting brackets can cause minor wall damage behind the unit. This needs patching and painting.

If you are doing a DIY removal, proceed with caution. Have a helper. Use protective coverings. If you hire professionals, they typically handle such issues. They often have insurance to cover accidental damage. You can find useful tips to avoid damage during removal from guides like [How To Pull Out Built-In Microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-pull-out-built-in-microwave). This helps ensure a smooth process.

#### Disposal Fees

While some local recycling centers offer free disposal, not all do. Some landfills or scrap metal yards charge a fee. If your installer does not include disposal, you might face a separate charge. These fees are usually minor, often $10 to $50. However, they add to the overall cost. Check with your local waste management services for their policies.

These hidden costs can add 10% to 30% to your initial budget. Always set aside an extra contingency fund. This helps cover any unforeseen expenses. A buffer of 15-20% is a good rule of thumb.

### Saving Money on Your Built-In Microwave Replacement

Replacing a built-in microwave can be costly. However, there are ways to save money. By making smart choices, you can reduce your total expense. I often advise people on how to cut costs without sacrificing quality.

#### Compare Prices and Look for Sales

The first step to saving money is smart shopping. Do not buy the first microwave you see. Research different brands and models. Compare prices from various retailers. This includes appliance stores, big box retailers, and online stores.

*   **Seasonal Sales:** Look for sales events. Major holidays like Black Friday, Memorial Day, or Labor Day often have appliance discounts.
*   **Clearance and Open-Box Deals:** Check for clearance sections. Retailers often sell floor models or open-box items at a reduced price. These units are often new or lightly used. They come with a full warranty.
*   **Bundling Deals:** If you are buying other appliances, ask about bundling deals. Some retailers offer discounts if you purchase multiple appliances at once.

Always check product reviews before buying. Ensure the discounted item meets your needs and has good reliability.

#### Consider DIY Installation (If Competent)

As discussed earlier, DIY installation can save you $100 to $400 in labor costs. If you are comfortable with basic tools and electrical safety, this is a great option. Make sure you understand the steps involved.

*   **Watch Tutorials:** Plenty of online videos and guides show how to remove and install built-in microwaves. These can walk you through each step.
*   **Gather Tools:** Ensure you have the necessary tools like screwdrivers, a drill, a level, and a voltage tester.
*   **Get Help:** A built-in microwave can be heavy. Ask a friend or family member for help during removal and installation. This prevents injury and damage.

Do not attempt DIY if you feel unsure. An incorrect installation can cost more in repairs later. Your safety is paramount. You can find detailed instructions for DIY removal in guides like [How To Take Down Built-In Microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-take-down-built-in-microwave). This helps you prepare.

#### Opt for a Basic Model

You can save significant money by choosing a basic built-in microwave. Do you truly need convection baking, sensor cooking, or smart features? Many households only use a microwave for reheating and defrosting.

*   **Essential Features:** A simple model will handle basic tasks perfectly. Focus on wattage and capacity.
*   **Avoid Unnecessary Upgrades:** Resist the urge to buy models with features you will rarely use. Each extra feature adds to the price.
*   **Brand Choice:** Consider lesser-known but reliable brands. They often offer similar quality to premium brands at a lower price point.

A basic microwave can cost half as much as a feature-rich model. This is a direct way to cut your total replacement cost.

#### Maintain Your Current Microwave

Preventative maintenance can extend the life of your existing microwave. This delays the need for replacement. Regular cleaning and proper use are key. I tell everyone that good maintenance saves money in the long run.

*   **Clean Regularly:** Wipe down the interior and exterior regularly. Food splatters can build up. This can lead to arcing or unpleasant odors.
*   **Avoid Metal:** Never put metal objects in the microwave. This can cause sparks and damage the magnetron.
*   **Do Not Run Empty:** Running a microwave without food or water can damage the magnetron. Always put something inside when operating it.
*   **Address Minor Issues Promptly:** If you notice small problems, address them. This prevents them from becoming major repairs. For instance, if your built-in microwave light bulb goes out, you can learn [How To Change Built-In Microwave Light Bulb](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-built-in-microwave-light-bulb) and fix it quickly.

By taking care of your current appliance, you can push back the replacement date. This saves you money over time.

### FAQ Section
