Use a saw to cut your lumber according to your measurements.
*   **Frame Pieces**: Cut four pieces for the long sides of the frame and four pieces for the short sides. Remember to account for the thickness of the wood when cutting the inner pieces. For example, if your machine is 27 inches wide and you use 2x4s (which are 1.5 inches thick), the inner cross pieces will be 27 - (1.5 * 2) = 24 inches.
*   **Plywood Top and Bottom**: Cut two pieces of ¾-inch plywood to the overall desired platform dimensions. These will be the top surface the machine rests on and the base that sits on the floor.

### Step 3: Assemble the Frame

This is where your platform takes shape.
*   **Build Two Rectangles**: Create two identical rectangular frames using the 2x4s or 2x6s. These frames will form the top and bottom structure of your platform.
    *   Lay out two long pieces and two short pieces to form a rectangle.
    *   Apply wood glue to the ends of the short pieces.
    *   Secure them to the long pieces using two screws at each joint. Ensure the corners are square using a speed square.
*   **Connect the Frames**: Stand the two frames upright, one above the other. Use vertical 2x4s or 4x4s as legs to connect the top frame to the bottom frame. The number of legs depends on the platform's length; typically, one at each corner and potentially one in the middle for longer platforms.
    *   Apply wood glue to the ends of the leg pieces.
    *   Screw them securely into the corners of both the top and bottom frames. Ensure the entire structure is level and plumb.

### Step 4: Attach Plywood Surfaces

Now, add the top and bottom surfaces of your platform.
*   **Bottom Plywood**: Lay one piece of cut plywood onto the bottom frame. Apply wood glue to the frame's top edges. Secure the plywood to the frame using screws, spacing them every 6-8 inches along the edges and any internal supports.
*   **Top Plywood**: Repeat the process for the top plywood. This surface will support the washing machine. Consider adding anti-vibration pads to the top surface before placing the machine.

### Step 5: Finish and Level

With the platform built, prepare it for use.
*   **Finish (Optional)**: Sand the platform smooth. You can paint, stain, or seal it to protect the wood and match your laundry room décor. This also adds to its durability.
*   **Place and Level**: Carefully move the finished platform into position in your laundry room. Use a level to check if the platform itself is level. If not, you may need to add shims under the bottom frame or adjust its placement.
*   **Move Washing Machine**: With assistance and an appliance dolly, carefully lift the washing machine onto your newly built platform. Ensure it is centered and stable.
*   **Final Leveling**: Use the washing machine's own leveling feet to make minor adjustments. This ensures the machine is perfectly level on the platform.

Building a DIY platform is a practical approach to raising your washing machine. It gives you a custom solution that fits your needs and budget.
