### Understanding the Dishwasher Drainage System

Your dishwasher has a specific system to remove water. It finishes cleaning cycles by pumping out dirty water through a drain hose. This hose connects to your home's main plumbing. Several components work together to make sure this process happens correctly. When water is sitting at the bottom of your dishwasher, it means one of these components is not doing its job.

This drainage system includes the filter, the drain pump, the drain hose, and sometimes an air gap. Each part must work well for the dishwasher to drain completely. If any part gets blocked or breaks, water will remain inside. We want to help you understand these parts. We also want to help you troubleshoot common drainage problems.

A common misconception is that a little water always remains. This is not entirely true for the main tub area after a full cycle. While some models might have a small amount of water in the sump or filter area to prevent seals from drying out, a large pool of dirty water is not normal. This indicates a problem. Knowing what *should* happen helps you find what is wrong.

### Clogged Dishwasher Filter and Sump Area

One of the most frequent reasons for water sitting at the bottom of your dishwasher is a clogged filter. The filter catches food particles and debris during wash cycles. If you do not clean this filter often, it can get blocked. A blocked filter stops water from draining out of the dishwasher tub. It also prevents water from reaching the drain pump effectively.

The filter is usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher, below the lower spray arm. It collects food scraps, grease, and other debris that wash off your dishes. Over time, this buildup becomes thick and gooey. It reduces the flow of water. This leads to standing water inside the appliance. [Why is my dishwasher filter full of water?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-dishwasher-filter-full-of-water) This is a common question, and a dirty filter is almost always the answer.

Cleaning your dishwasher filter is a simple maintenance task. It can solve many drainage issues. I make sure to clean mine every few weeks, or more often if we use the dishwasher a lot. Neglecting this simple step can lead to bigger problems. It can also cause your dishes to come out less clean.

#### How to Clean Your Dishwasher Filter:

1.  **Turn off Power:** Disconnect power to your dishwasher for safety.
2.  **Locate Filter:** Find the filter assembly at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.
3.  **Remove Filter:** Twist or lift the filter parts according to your model's manual. Most models have a coarse filter and a fine mesh filter.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Use warm, soapy water and a soft brush to remove all food particles and grease. You can also run water through the parts to ensure all holes are clear.
5.  **Reinstall Filter:** Put the clean filter parts back in place securely. Make sure they click into position.
6.  **Run a Cycle:** Run a short rinse cycle to check if the water drains properly.

Regular cleaning helps prevent future clogs. It keeps your dishwasher running efficiently. This simple step can often fix the problem of [water sitting at the bottom of your dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-there-water-at-the-bottom-of-dishwasher).

### Blocked or Kinked Dishwasher Drain Hose

The drain hose carries dirty water from your dishwasher to your kitchen sink drain or garbage disposal. If this hose is blocked or kinked, water cannot flow out properly. This causes water to back up into the dishwasher tub. A common cause for a blockage is food particles, grease, or even small objects that slip past the filter.

A kink in the hose is often simpler to fix than a clog. The hose can get bent or twisted if you move the dishwasher. It can also happen during installation if there is not enough space behind the appliance. I always recommend checking the hose's path from the dishwasher to the sink. Make sure it has a smooth, unobstructed route.

Sometimes, the connection point to the garbage disposal or sink drain can get clogged. If your garbage disposal is full of food waste, it can create a blockage that affects the dishwasher drain. Running the garbage disposal before starting the dishwasher is a good practice. This helps clear any potential obstructions at the connection point.

#### Steps to Check and Clear the Drain Hose:

1.  **Disconnect Power:** Unplug your dishwasher from the power outlet.
2.  **Pull Out Dishwasher:** Carefully slide the dishwasher out from its cabinet space. This gives you access to the back of the appliance.
3.  **Inspect Hose:** Look for any visible kinks or bends in the drain hose. Straighten any kinks you find.
4.  **Check Connections:** Examine where the drain hose connects to the dishwasher and to your sink drain or garbage disposal.
5.  **Disconnect Hose (if needed):** If you suspect a clog, disconnect the hose from both ends. Have a bucket ready to catch any residual water.
6.  **Clear Clog:** Use a long brush or snake tool to push through any blockages in the hose. You can also flush it with water.
7.  **Reinstall Hose:** Connect the hose securely. Ensure it is not kinked when you push the dishwasher back into place.

Addressing drain hose issues is crucial for proper drainage. It will prevent [water from collecting at the bottom of your dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-dishwasher-have-water-at-the-bottom).

### Malfunctioning Dishwasher Drain Pump

The drain pump is a vital component that forces water out of the dishwasher. If this pump breaks or has a blockage, water will not leave the tub. You might hear a humming sound without any water draining. Or you might hear nothing at all during the drain cycle. This suggests the pump is failing or completely broken.

The drain pump has an impeller, which is a small fan-like part that spins to push water. If debris like broken glass, fruit pits, or plastic pieces reach the pump, they can jam the impeller. This prevents it from spinning freely. A jammed pump cannot expel water. This leads to [standing water in your dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/should-water-be-sitting-in-dishwasher-drain).

Sometimes, the electrical motor that powers the pump can burn out. This usually requires a replacement of the entire drain pump assembly. This is a more involved repair than cleaning a filter or hose. If you have ruled out clogs in the filter and hose, the drain pump is the next likely suspect.

#### Troubleshooting a Dishwasher Drain Pump:

1.  **Disconnect Power:** Always unplug the dishwasher first.
2.  **Remove Standing Water:** Manually remove any water from the dishwasher tub using towels or a wet vacuum. [How to drain out water from dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-out-water-from-dishwasher) manually is a key first step here.
3.  **Access Pump:** The drain pump is usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher, often beneath the sump area. You may need to remove the lower spray arm and filter housing. Consult your owner's manual for exact instructions on accessing the pump.
4.  **Check for Debris:** Look for any foreign objects jamming the impeller. Carefully remove any debris.
5.  **Test for Movement:** Try to turn the impeller manually. It should spin freely. If it feels stiff or does not move, it might be jammed or broken.
6.  **Electrical Check (Advanced):** If you are comfortable with electrical testing, you can check the pump's motor for continuity with a multimeter. This step is best left to a professional if you are unsure.
7.  **Consider Replacement:** If the pump is jammed and you cannot clear it, or if the motor is faulty, you will need to replace the drain pump. This part often costs between $50 and $200, plus labor if you hire a technician.

A working drain pump is essential for a dishwasher that drains properly. Addressing pump issues ensures no water is left behind. This prevents any further problems.

### Air Gap or High Loop Installation Problems

Many dishwashers use an air gap or a high loop in the drain hose. Both prevent dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. These features are important parts of proper installation. If either the air gap or high loop is not installed correctly or becomes blocked, water will not drain. It will remain at the bottom of the dishwasher.

An air gap is a small cylindrical fixture on your kitchen countertop, near the sink. It has two hose connections underneath. One hose comes from the dishwasher's drain pump, and the other goes to the garbage disposal or sink drain. Its purpose is to create a break in the drainage line. This prevents dirty sink water from siphoning back into the dishwasher. If the air gap itself gets clogged with food particles, it will stop water flow from the dishwasher.

A high loop is an alternative to an air gap. It involves securing the dishwasher drain hose in a high position under the sink. This creates a loop that rises higher than the dishwasher's drain connection point. This high point prevents backflow and siphoning. If the hose sags or the high loop is not tall enough, it loses its effectiveness. Water can then flow back into the dishwasher.

#### Inspecting Air Gap and High Loop:

1.  **Check Air Gap:**
    *   **Remove Cover:** Lift off the chrome cap on your countertop air gap.
    *   **Inspect for Clogs:** Look into the opening for any food debris or sludge.
    *   **Clean:** Use a pipe cleaner or a small brush to clear any blockages. Flush it with water.
    *   **Verify Hoses:** Ensure the hoses connected to the bottom of the air gap are clear and properly attached.
2.  **Check High Loop:**
    *   **Locate Hose:** Find the dishwasher drain hose under your sink.
    *   **Verify Height:** Ensure the hose rises high above the dishwasher's connection point before descending to the sink drain or garbage disposal. It should be securely fastened.
    *   **Check for Sags/Kinks:** Make sure there are no sags in the hose below the high point. Sags can trap water. Also, ensure there are no kinks.
    *   **Clear Clogs:** If the high loop is correct but water still backs up, the clog might be inside the hose itself, which we discussed earlier.

Correct air gap or high loop installation is critical for preventing backflow. It helps ensure your dishwasher drains completely. If you have [water sitting at the bottom of your dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-water-should-be-in-bottom-of-dishwasher), checking this aspect is a smart move.

### Kitchen Sink Drain Clogs Affecting Your Dishwasher

Your dishwasher's drain hose often connects to your kitchen sink's plumbing. It might connect to the garbage disposal or directly to the sink drain. If your kitchen sink drain is partially or completely clogged, it creates a significant problem for your dishwasher. The dirty water from your dishwasher has nowhere to go. It then backs up into the dishwasher tub.

This is a very common scenario. If you notice your sink draining slowly, especially when you run water, it is a strong indicator of a sink clog. When the dishwasher tries to drain, it adds more water to an already struggling system. This causes the water to remain in the dishwasher. Sometimes, you might even see water from the dishwasher back up into your sink.

The P-trap under your sink is a common place for clogs. It collects grease, food particles, and hair over time. If you have a garbage disposal, food waste can accumulate within it. This also blocks the drain path for your dishwasher. This problem affects both your sink and your dishwasher.

#### Resolving Sink Drain Issues:

1.  **Run Garbage Disposal:** If you have a garbage disposal, run it with cold water for at least 30 seconds. Make sure it is completely clear of food waste. This is the simplest first step.
2.  **Use a Plunger:** If the sink is still slow, try plunging the sink. Make sure to seal off the other sink drain (if you have a double sink) and the dishwasher air gap hole (if applicable) for better suction.
3.  **Clean the P-Trap:**
    *   **Place Bucket:** Put a bucket under the P-trap (the U-shaped pipe under your sink).
    *   **Loosen Nuts:** Use channel lock pliers to loosen the slip nuts on both sides of the P-trap.
    *   **Remove and Clean:** Carefully remove the P-trap. Dump any water and debris into the bucket. Clean the inside of the trap thoroughly with a brush.
    *   **Reassemble:** Put the P-trap back in place and tighten the nuts. Test for leaks.
4.  **Chemical Drain Cleaner (Use with Caution):** As a last resort, you can use a chemical drain cleaner designed for kitchen sinks. Follow the product instructions carefully. I typically avoid these as they can damage pipes.
5.  **Professional Plumber:** If you cannot clear the clog yourself, call a professional plumber. A stubborn clog might require specialized tools to clear.

Clearing a clogged kitchen sink drain often solves the issue of [water sitting at the bottom of your dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-dishwasher-have-water-at-the-bottom). It ensures all water has a clear path to exit your home's plumbing system.

### Incompatible Detergent and Excessive Suds

Using the wrong type of detergent or too much detergent can lead to excessive suds. These suds can create a problem for your dishwasher's drainage system. The suds get so thick that they behave like a blockage. The drain pump cannot push through a dense mass of foam effectively. This leaves water, along with the suds, at the bottom of the tub.

Dishwashers require specific low-sudsing detergents. Regular dish soap, like the kind you use for handwashing dishes, produces too many suds. This is because regular dish soap is designed to create lots of foam. Dishwasher detergent, on the other hand, is formulated to clean without excessive sudsing. Always use a detergent specifically labeled for automatic dishwashers.

Even with the correct dishwasher detergent, using too much can cause problems. Overdosing on detergent can lead to a buildup of soap residue. This residue then traps food particles and creates more suds. This makes it harder for the machine to rinse properly and drain completely. The result is often standing water at the bottom of the machine.

#### Preventing Suds-Related Drainage Issues:

1.  **Use Only Dishwasher Detergent:** Never use hand dish soap in your dishwasher. This is a common mistake that quickly leads to suds and drainage issues.
2.  **Measure Detergent:** Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for detergent dosage. Most dishwashers do not need a full dispenser cup, especially if your water is soft or your dishes are only lightly soiled.
3.  **Adjust for Water Hardness:** If you have soft water, you might need even less detergent. Hard water generally requires a bit more, but always start with the recommended amount.
4.  **Run a Vinegar Rinse:** If you suspect a suds buildup, run an empty cycle with a cup of white vinegar placed in the top rack. Vinegar helps cut through grease and dissolve soap residue.
5.  **Check Rinse Aid:** Ensure your rinse aid dispenser is working correctly. Rinse aid helps prevent spotting and also helps water sheet off dishes, which can reduce residual suds.

Managing your detergent use and choosing the correct product can prevent issues. This simple change helps ensure your dishwasher drains completely. It leaves no [water sitting at the bottom of your dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-water-should-be-in-bottom-of-dishwasher).

### Faulty Inlet Valve or Float Assembly Issues

While less common for direct water retention after a cycle, issues with the water inlet valve or float assembly can sometimes contribute to drainage problems. The float assembly is a safety device. It detects the water level in the dishwasher tub. It tells the water inlet valve to stop filling the dishwasher when the water reaches the correct level.

If the water inlet valve sticks open, the dishwasher might overfill. Too much water could overwhelm the drain pump. It might also cause water to seep back into the tub if the drain hose cannot handle the volume. A faulty inlet valve might drip water into the tub even when the dishwasher is off. This leads to a small pool of water always present.

The float assembly can also get stuck. If the float is jammed in the "up" position, the dishwasher will think it is full of water. This prevents it from filling at all. If it is stuck in the "down" position, it might allow the dishwasher to overfill. An overfilled dishwasher could struggle to drain all the excess water.

#### Checking the Inlet Valve and Float Assembly:

1.  **Water Inlet Valve:**
    *   **Inspect for Leaks:** Check for any visible water leaks around the water inlet valve, usually located at the bottom front of the dishwasher.
    *   **Listen for Drips:** If the dishwasher is off and you hear dripping, the valve might be faulty and allowing water to slowly enter.
    *   **Professional Help:** Replacing an inlet valve typically requires a technician.
2.  **Float Assembly:**
    *   **Locate Float:** The float is usually a small plastic cup or cylinder in the bottom of the dishwasher tub, often in a corner.
    *   **Test Movement:** Gently press down on the float and release it. It should move freely up and down.
    *   **Clean:** If it feels sticky or jammed, clean around it. Food debris or mineral deposits can sometimes prevent it from moving properly.
    *   **Inspect Switch:** Below the float, there is a small switch that activates when the float rises. Ensure this switch is not damaged.

These components are generally robust. They do not fail as often as filters or drain hoses. But if you have ruled out other common causes, it is worth considering these. If the problem is persistent [standing water at the bottom of your dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/should-water-be-sitting-in-dishwasher-drain), these are potential issues to investigate.

**Q2: Can I run my dishwasher if there's standing water?**
No, you should not run your dishwasher if there is standing water at the bottom. Running it will not solve the drainage issue. It could worsen the problem, cause water to overflow, or even damage the appliance. Always clear the standing water and fix the drainage issue before running another cycle.

**Q3: How do I unclog a dishwasher drain without a plumber?**
You can often unclog a dishwasher drain yourself. Start by cleaning the filter at the bottom of the tub. Then, check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. Also, ensure your kitchen sink drain or garbage disposal is clear. Use a soft brush or snake tool for stubborn hose clogs.

**Q4: How often should I clean my dishwasher filter?**
You should clean your dishwasher filter regularly, ideally once a month. If you use your dishwasher frequently, or if you often pre-rinse dishes with lots of food particles, you might need to clean it more often. A clean filter prevents clogs and ensures efficient drainage.

**Q5: What if my dishwasher still has water after cleaning the filter?**
If cleaning the filter does not solve the problem, the issue is likely elsewhere. Check the drain hose for kinks or clogs. Make sure your kitchen sink drain is clear. The drain pump itself might also be faulty or jammed. Investigate these other potential causes step by step.

**Q6: Does my LG dishwasher have specific issues with water sitting at the bottom?**
While all dishwashers can experience drainage issues, some brands might have known quirks. For LG dishwashers, common causes still revolve around clogged filters, drain hoses, or a faulty drain pump. Always consult your specific LG model's manual for unique troubleshooting steps. The principles of drainage remain similar across most brands.
