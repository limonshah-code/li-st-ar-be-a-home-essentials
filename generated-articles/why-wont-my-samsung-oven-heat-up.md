### Why Won't My Samsung Oven Heat Up?

A Samsung oven typically fails to heat due to a faulty heating element (electric models), a defective igniter (gas models), a bad temperature sensor, or a main control board issue. Less common causes include power supply problems, a door latch malfunction, or incorrect settings.

## Checking Initial Power and Oven Settings

Your Samsung oven needs proper power to heat. Power problems are often simple to fix. Always start your troubleshooting here. Check the circuit breaker first.

Ensure the oven power cord is fully plugged into the wall outlet. A loose plug can stop all functions. It might also prevent heating. Next, look at your home's electrical panel. Find the circuit breaker labeled for the oven. This breaker might be tripped. A tripped breaker will be in the middle or "off" position. Flip it fully to "off," then back to "on." This restores power. If the breaker trips again, a serious electrical problem exists. You will need an electrician for this.

Confirm the oven settings are correct. You might have the oven set to a timer function or Sabbath mode. These modes can stop the oven from heating. Consult your Samsung oven user manual for mode descriptions. Make sure the oven is set to a standard bake or roast mode. The temperature must also be above room temperature. A setting error is a simple fix. Do not forget to check the control panel. Sometimes, a "control lock" feature is active. This feature prevents any changes. Disable it if it is on.

If the oven powers on but does not heat, look for error codes. Samsung ovens often display codes on the digital screen. These codes point to specific issues. For example, a code might indicate a temperature sensor problem. Note any error codes you see. This information helps with further diagnosis or professional repair.

A good power supply is crucial. Without it, no component can work. A reset often clears minor glitches. Try unplugging the oven for five minutes. Then plug it back in. This soft reset can resolve temporary electronic issues. This step is similar to restarting a computer. It can fix small software errors.

## Common Culprits: Heating Elements and Igniters

When your Samsung oven will not heat up, the heating element or igniter is often the cause. These parts create the heat. Electric ovens use heating elements. Gas ovens use igniters. Knowing which one your oven has helps troubleshooting.

### Electric Oven Heating Elements

Electric ovens have two main heating elements. The bake element is on the bottom. The broil element is at the top. When you set your oven to bake, the bake element heats up. A faulty element will not glow red. It will also not produce heat. You can often see damage. Look for breaks, blisters, or burn marks on the element. You might need to remove racks to see it clearly. This visual check is important.

Testing an element with a multimeter gives a precise answer. Unplug the oven first. Access the element terminals. Measure the resistance (ohms) across them. A good element shows a specific resistance range, typically between 15 and 30 ohms. If the reading is zero or infinite, the element is bad. Replace a bad element. This repair is often straightforward. Many homeowners complete this task themselves.

If your Samsung electric oven does not heat, a bad element is a common reason. You can often buy replacement elements online. Make sure to get the correct part number for your specific Samsung model. This ensures a proper fit and function. Sometimes, an element might look fine but still be faulty. A multimeter test confirms its condition.

### Gas Oven Igniters

Gas ovens use an igniter to light the gas. The igniter also acts as a safety device. It senses if there is a flame. If no flame, it shuts off the gas. A weak or failing igniter is a common issue. It might glow red for a long time but not light the gas. Or it might not glow at all. When you turn on a gas oven, listen for the "whoosh" sound of the gas lighting. If you do not hear it, the igniter is likely failing. You might also smell gas if the igniter does not light it quickly.

To check the igniter, unplug the oven and turn off the gas supply. Access the igniter, typically at the bottom or back of the oven. Inspect it for cracks or physical damage. Like an element, you can test an igniter with a multimeter. It should show a resistance reading. An igniter that glows but does not ignite the gas usually indicates it is too weak. Its resistance is out of spec. This means it draws insufficient current to open the gas valve.

Replacing a gas igniter is more complex than an electric element. It involves working with gas lines. If you are uncomfortable, call a professional. A faulty igniter means your Samsung oven will not heat up. It is a critical safety part. Never ignore a gas smell. If you smell gas and the igniter does not light it, turn off the gas supply immediately. This is a serious safety concern.

## Thermostat and Temperature Sensor Problems

The oven's thermostat and temperature sensor work together. They control the oven's heat. A fault in either part causes heating problems. Your Samsung oven needs accurate temperature readings to bake food properly.

### The Role of the Temperature Sensor

The temperature sensor measures the oven's internal heat. It sends this information to the control board. The control board then adjusts the heating element or igniter. If the sensor sends incorrect readings, the oven might not heat to the set temperature. It might overheat or stay too cool. A common symptom of a bad sensor is inconsistent baking results. You might also see error codes on the display. These codes often point to a sensor issue.

You can test the temperature sensor with a multimeter. First, unplug the oven. The sensor is usually inside the oven cavity, often at the back or top. It looks like a thin metal probe. Disconnect its wires. Measure the sensor's resistance. The resistance changes with temperature. At room temperature (around 70°F or 21°C), a typical oven sensor reads about 1080 ohms. Check your oven's service manual for the exact resistance value. If the reading is far off, the sensor is faulty. Replacing the sensor is often easy. It usually involves removing a few screws and plugging in a new one.

### How the Thermostat Works

Older Samsung oven models might use a mechanical thermostat. This component directly controls power to the heating element. It has a capillary tube that senses temperature. A faulty thermostat might cause the oven not to heat at all. It might also cause it to heat improperly. Modern Samsung ovens rely more on electronic temperature sensors. The control board interprets the sensor data. The control board then acts as the "thermostat."

If your Samsung oven has a conventional thermostat, it can fail electrically. You can test it for continuity. A lack of continuity means the thermostat circuit is open. This prevents power from reaching the heating element. A professional technician is best for thermostat replacement. It can be a complex job.

A bad temperature sensor or thermostat can cause your Samsung oven to not heat up correctly. It might not reach high temperatures, or it might struggle to maintain them. If your Samsung oven heats but only reaches 150 degrees, a failing sensor or heating component is likely the cause. Learn more about specific temperature limits here: [Why Won't My Samsung Oven Go Over 150 Degrees](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-samsung-oven-go-over-150-degrees). Ensure these components are functioning properly for reliable oven performance.

## Control Board and Wiring Failures

The control board is the "brain" of your Samsung oven. It sends signals to all parts. Wiring connects these parts to the control board. Problems with either can stop your oven from heating.

### Diagnosing a Faulty Control Board

The main control board manages heating cycles. It processes temperature sensor readings. It turns heating elements or igniters on and off. If the control board fails, it might not send power to the heating components. Your oven display might work, but the oven will not heat. Common signs of a bad control board include:
*   The oven does not respond to commands.
*   Random error codes appear.
*   The oven heats erratically or not at all.
*   The control panel lights up, but nothing happens.

Diagnosing a control board is difficult for homeowners. It often requires advanced electrical knowledge. Visual inspection can sometimes reveal burned components or scorch marks on the board. These are clear signs of damage. However, a board can fail without visible damage. If all other components (elements, igniter, sensor) test good, the control board is a strong suspect. Replacing a control board is expensive. It often costs more than other parts. Get a professional opinion before buying a new board. A faulty control board is a major reason why a Samsung oven will not heat up.

### Checking for Wiring Issues

Wires carry electricity to all oven parts. Loose, corroded, or burned wires stop power flow. This can prevent heating elements or igniters from working. Always unplug the oven before checking wires. Check all wire connections leading to:
*   The bake element or igniter.
*   The temperature sensor.
*   The control board.
*   The terminal block where the power cord connects.

Look for signs of heat damage on wires. Insulation might be brittle or melted. Connectors might look discolored. Loose connections cause arcing. This generates heat and damages wires. Use a multimeter to test for continuity in suspected wires. A wire with no continuity is broken. You can often repair loose connections by tightening them. Replace damaged wires. Wires should be correctly sized and insulated for high heat environments.

Damaged wiring or a faulty control board requires attention. They are key parts of the oven's electrical system. Never try to repair a control board yourself. It contains sensitive electronics. Wiring issues can be dangerous if not fixed correctly. If you find significant wiring damage, or suspect the control board, contact a qualified technician. This ensures safety and proper repair. Remember, an oven that does not turn on at all might have a core control problem.

## Oven Door Latch and Safety Mechanisms

Your Samsung oven has safety features. The door latch is one of them. It ensures the oven door is closed during operation. This prevents heat loss. It also protects users from hot elements. A faulty door latch can prevent the oven from heating.

### How the Door Latch Affects Heating

Modern ovens often have a safety switch. This switch is connected to the door latch. When the door is open, the switch is open. This prevents the heating elements from activating. This is a safety feature. It protects you from accidental burns. If the door latch does not close properly, the switch might stay open. The oven "thinks" the door is open. It will not allow heating. This is a common issue with Samsung ovens. Especially if the oven was recently moved or if the door has been slammed.

Check if the oven door closes fully. It should sit flush with the oven frame. Listen for a "click" when you close it. This click indicates the latch is engaged. Inspect the latch mechanism itself. It is usually located at the top of the oven door opening. Look for any broken plastic pieces or misalignment. Sometimes, food debris can block the latch. Clean any debris you find.

A common symptom of a bad door latch switch is when the oven light stays on. Or the control panel shows an "open door" error. Even when the door looks closed, the switch might not be making contact. You can test the door switch with a multimeter. Unplug the oven first. Access the switch. Test for continuity when the door is closed (switch engaged). It should show continuity. If not, the switch is bad.

### Other Safety Features

Samsung ovens also have thermal fuses. These are one-time use safety devices. They blow if the oven overheats. A blown thermal fuse means the oven will not heat at all. It cuts power to the entire unit. This protects your home from fire. A thermal fuse usually blows due to another issue. An example is a bad temperature sensor causing overheating. Replacing a thermal fuse requires finding the root cause. Otherwise, the new fuse will blow again.

The oven light might stay on if a door switch is stuck. This prevents heating. Ensure the light turns off when you close the door. If it stays on, the door switch is likely faulty or misaligned.

Always ensure all safety features work. If your Samsung oven will not heat up, check the door latch. Make sure it engages fully. Repair or replace any faulty door components. A properly functioning door latch is vital for safety and operation.

## Troubleshooting Gas vs. Electric Samsung Ovens

Samsung offers both gas and electric ovens. The reasons why they do not heat differ. Understanding these differences helps in troubleshooting. Both types have unique components that can fail.

### Gas Oven Specific Issues

Gas ovens use gas burners for heat. The main components for heating are the igniter and the gas valve. If your gas oven does not heat, consider these:
*   **Gas Supply:** First, ensure the oven receives gas. Check the gas shut-off valve behind the oven. Make sure it is fully open. You can also try lighting a gas burner on the cooktop. If the cooktop burners work, gas reaches the appliance. If not, the issue is with your home's gas supply. Contact your gas utility.
*   **Igniter Failure:** As discussed, the igniter glows to ignite gas. If it glows but no flame appears, the igniter is weak. It does not draw enough current to open the gas valve. If it does not glow at all, it is faulty. Replace the igniter.
*   **Gas Valve:** The gas valve opens to allow gas flow. The igniter's current tells it to open. If the igniter is good but no gas flows, the gas valve might be bad. This part is complex and often needs professional replacement.
*   **Flame Sensor/Thermocouple:** Some gas ovens have a flame sensor or thermocouple. It ensures the flame is present. If it fails, it shuts off gas for safety. This prevents the oven from heating.
*   **Burner Orifice:** A clogged or dirty burner orifice can stop gas flow to the burner. This prevents proper ignition or heating. Cleaning it can fix the problem.

If you smell gas but no ignition, turn off the oven and the gas supply immediately. Ventilate your home. This is a safety hazard. Call a professional. My Samsung oven is a gas model. It needs special attention. My gas oven will not heat up but the stove works. This points directly to an oven-specific gas component.

### Electric Oven Specific Issues

Electric ovens use electric current to heat elements. Their heating issues usually involve electrical parts.
*   **Bake and Broil Elements:** These are the primary heating sources. They fail by breaking or shorting out. Visually check them for damage. Test them with a multimeter for continuity and resistance. If they are broken, replace them.
*   **Thermal Fuse:** Electric ovens often have a thermal fuse. If it blows, the oven completely loses power. It indicates an overheating issue. Find and fix the cause of overheating before replacing the fuse.
*   **Relay Board:** Many electric ovens have a relay board. It is part of the control system. Relays on this board switch power to the heating elements. If a relay sticks open or fails, the element will not get power. This board is often part of the main control board or a separate component. A bad relay board requires replacement.
*   **Terminal Block:** The terminal block connects the oven's power cord to its internal wiring. Loose or burned connections here can prevent the oven from getting full power. This stops it from heating. Inspect it for signs of scorching or damage.

When your Samsung oven will not heat up, identify if it's gas or electric. This directs your troubleshooting. Gas models require caution with gas lines. Electric models focus on electrical components. Both types share common issues like faulty temperature sensors or control boards. But the primary heating mechanisms are different.
