## Understanding Cushman Furniture History

The H.T. Cushman Manufacturing Company has a fascinating history. It started in 1886 in North Bennington, Vermont. Henry T. Cushman began making cedar chests. Over time, the company expanded its offerings. It became famous for its colonial-style furniture. This furniture appealed to many American homes.

The company's golden age was in the mid-20th century. This was when the "Colonial Creations" line became very popular. Cushman furniture was a household name. It represented durable, attractive pieces for everyday living. The company went through various changes. It was eventually bought by General Interiors in 1965. Understanding these periods helps pinpoint the age of your item.

Cushman continued production under different ownership for some years. It finally ceased operations in 1980. Each era brought subtle changes to designs and markings. Knowing the company's timeline is your first step. It provides a valuable framework for dating your furniture.

## Decoding Cushman Labels and Marks

Identifying specific labels and marks is crucial for dating Cushman furniture. The company used different types of identification throughout its history. These marks often include the company name, location, and sometimes a model number. Finding these marks gives you strong clues about when your piece was made.

Common places to look for marks include the back of a piece, inside a drawer, or underneath a tabletop. Some items might have paper labels. Others feature stamped or branded marks directly onto the wood. Always clean the area gently before looking for marks. This ensures you do not damage any delicate labels.

Sometimes, marks are faded or partially removed. Use a flashlight and a magnifying glass for a closer look. Pay attention to the font style and specific wording. These details can change over time and help you narrow down the age.

### Early Cushman Marks (Pre-1930s)

Early Cushman pieces often have simpler marks. These might be a small paper label or a hand-stamped name. You might see "H.T. Cushman Mfg. Co., N. Bennington, VT." sometimes with a patent date. These early pieces focus more on cedar chests and other basic furnishings. They reflect a period of growth and establishment for the company.

Finding these older marks can be exciting. They tell a story of the company's beginnings. These pieces are less common than later items. They often show a different kind of craftsmanship. Their rarity can also impact their value.

The earliest marks are typically found on the bottom or back of a piece. They might be less prominent than later, mass-produced labels. If you find one, you likely have a very old Cushman item. This piece dates before their most popular Colonial Creations line.

### Colonial Creations Era (1930s-1960s)

The "Cushman Colonial Creations" line is their most recognized period. Furniture from this era often bears a specific mark. You will see a rectangular label or stamp. It typically reads "Cushman Colonial Creations" with "Authentic Designs" or "Vermont" underneath. Many pieces also have a number stamped on them. This number can refer to the design or production batch.

This period saw the introduction of their signature finishes. They used deep, warm tones. The designs were inspired by early American furniture. These pieces became very popular in homes across the country. The demand for them was high.

Look for a small metal tag sometimes. It will say "Cushman Colonial Creations." These tags were often tacked onto a drawer edge or the back of a chair. Pieces from this time are durable. They continue to be collected today. Knowing this specific mark helps date many Cushman items.

### Later Cushman Marks (Post-1960s)

After 1965, the company changed hands. General Interiors acquired Cushman. The marks changed again. You might find labels with "General Interiors" or "Cushman by General Interiors." These pieces may also have different style numbers or production codes. The overall design focus shifted slightly during this time.

Later pieces might show less of the traditional Colonial style. They could incorporate elements of modern design trends. The quality remained good. However, the distinct "Cushman Colonial Creations" identity became less prominent. These pieces often lack the specific wooden tags or branded stamps of earlier items.

The very last pieces, produced before 1980, may have minimal or different identification. Always look for any stamp or sticker. Even a small detail can provide a clue to its age. These later marks often use different fonts or less ornate designs.

## Identifying Cushman Furniture Styles

Cushman furniture is famous for its distinctive styles. Knowing these styles helps you date a piece even without a clear mark. The company primarily focused on interpretations of American Colonial and Early American designs. Their pieces are often simple, sturdy, and functional. They have a timeless appeal.

The most iconic style is "Colonial Creations." This line features clean lines and a rustic yet refined appearance. Cushman often used solid hardwoods like maple and birch. They created pieces for living rooms, dining rooms, and bedrooms. These items were designed to last.

Other companies also made colonial-style furniture. It is important to know what makes Cushman stand out. For example, [How to Date Kittinger Furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-date-kittinger-furniture) and [How to Date Pulaski Furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-date-pulaski-furniture) discuss different manufacturers. Cushman pieces often have unique leg turnings. They also use particular drawer pull designs. These details help distinguish them from competitors.

### The Colonial Creations Aesthetic

The Colonial Creations line defines Cushman's signature look. These pieces embody an early American aesthetic. They often feature simple forms. Tapered legs, turned stretchers, and exposed wooden pegs are common. The finishes are usually dark, warm tones, highlighting the wood grain. This style was popular from the 1930s through the 1960s.

Look for specific details like the "lazy susan" dining tables or particular chair back designs. These are hallmarks of Cushman. The furniture feels substantial and well-built. It has a handcrafted appearance, even though it was mass-produced. The lines are not ornate or overly decorative. This simplicity adds to its enduring charm.

Cushman often produced full suites of furniture in this style. You might find matching dressers, beds, and nightstands. This consistency in design helps confirm if a piece belongs to the Colonial Creations era.

## Examining Wood Types and Finishes

The types of wood and finishes Cushman used changed over time. These changes offer additional clues for dating your furniture. Cushman primarily worked with solid hardwoods. Maple and birch were their most common choices. These woods are durable and take stains well. Their early pieces might feature different woods.

During the Colonial Creations era, maple and birch were standard. Cushman developed specific finishes for these woods. Their "Harvest" finish became very popular. It is a warm, reddish-brown tone. This finish gives the furniture a rich, aged look. Later pieces might show lighter finishes or different wood species.

Always examine the underside or inside of a drawer. This area often shows the original wood color before sun exposure or wear. Pay attention to how the finish has aged. This can provide hints about its true vintage. Different finishes suggest different production periods.

Cushman also used a process called "distressing" on some pieces. This was done to give new furniture an aged appearance. This might include small dents or wormholes. This practice was common during the Colonial Creations period. It aimed to make the furniture look authentically old. This is different from natural wear and tear.

## Analyzing Hardware and Construction Methods

Hardware and construction methods are key identifiers for dating Cushman furniture. The types of drawer pulls, hinges, and joinery used varied over the decades. Early pieces might feature simple wooden knobs or brass pulls. Later designs often incorporated more decorative hardware. Look closely at how drawers are built.

Many Cushman drawers use dovetailed joints. This is a sign of good quality craftsmanship. However, the exact type of dovetail can change. Hand-cut dovetails often appear on older pieces. Machine-cut dovetails became more common in later production. Pay attention to the uniformity of the cuts. This can indicate if it's an earlier or later machine setup.

Cushman also used wooden drawer slides. These were typical for their time. Metal slides are a sign of much newer furniture, not original Cushman. The back panels of cabinets and dressers are often thin wood panels set into grooves. This is a common construction method for their pieces.

Consider how the legs are attached to tables and chairs. Are they bolted, doweled, or mortised and tenoned? These construction details can point to specific manufacturing practices of different eras. For instance, [How to Date a Gate Leg Table](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-date-a-gate-leg-table) details how construction matters for other furniture types. Cushman's robust construction generally means their pieces hold up well. Sometimes, older pieces may need some care. Knowing [How to Clean Furniture Hardware](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-furniture-hardware) can help you inspect it properly.

## Consulting Catalogs and Resources

Old catalogs and company brochures are invaluable resources. They show specific designs and models from different years. You can often find digitized versions of these catalogs online. Historical societies and antique furniture forums also store such information. These resources allow you to compare your piece directly with known examples.

Many collectors share information about Cushman furniture. Online communities and dedicated websites can provide insights. These platforms often have photo archives and discussions. They can help you identify rare marks or unusual pieces. Using these resources can confirm your suspicions about a piece's age.

Look for archives from the H.T. Cushman Manufacturing Company. Libraries specializing in furniture history may have physical copies. These original documents are the most accurate way to date a piece. They list specific model numbers and the years they were produced. This method removes much of the guesswork.

You can also find articles or books about American antique furniture. These publications often cover prominent manufacturers like Cushman. They detail stylistic trends and production changes over time. Using multiple sources helps you build a strong case for your furniture's age. For general dating tips, articles like [How to Date Berkey and Gay Furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-date-berkey-and-gay-furniture) or [How to Date Barley Twist Furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-date-barley-twist-furniture) can provide a broader context on antique identification techniques. Sometimes, pieces might have damage that needs repair. Knowing [How to Strip Antique Furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-strip-antique-furniture) can be useful for restoration.

## Distinguishing Cushman from Ethan Allen

Cushman furniture is often confused with Ethan Allen furniture. Both companies produced colonial-style furniture. They both used solid hardwoods like maple. However, they were separate companies with distinct histories. Ethan Allen started later than Cushman and also produced furniture inspired by early American designs. Understanding the differences helps you avoid misidentification.

Ethan Allen furniture often has its own unique marks and styles. Their pieces might feature different hardware or slightly varied joinery. While both offered sturdy, traditional furniture, their exact aesthetics varied. Cushman pieces typically have a heavier, more rustic feel in their Colonial Creations line. Ethan Allen leaned into broader traditional styles.

Always look for the specific manufacturer's mark. A clear "Cushman Colonial Creations" stamp confirms it is a Cushman piece. If the mark says "Ethan Allen," then it belongs to that company. Do not assume a colonial-style piece is Cushman without proper identification. Learning the specific design nuances of each brand helps in accurate dating.

Ethan Allen also used various finishes over time. Some of these were similar to Cushman's warm wood tones. However, their furniture lines evolved differently. By focusing on the unique marks and construction of Cushman, you can confidently distinguish it. This helps ensure you correctly date and identify your valuable furniture.
