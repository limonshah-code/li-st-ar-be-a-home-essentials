## Clean Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter for Spotless Dishes

Have you noticed your dishes are not as clean as they used to be? Perhaps there is a strange odor coming from your Kenmore dishwasher. These are common signs of a dirty dishwasher filter. A clogged filter traps food particles. This prevents proper water circulation during wash cycles. I know how frustrating it is to unload dirty dishes. This simple cleaning task can make a big difference.

Learning how to clean the filter in a Kenmore dishwasher is a vital skill for any homeowner. This guide will walk you through the entire process. We will cover finding the filter, removing it, and cleaning it effectively. You will also learn about reinstalling it correctly and maintaining it over time. I will share tips for troubleshooting common issues related to a dirty filter. By the end, you will have the knowledge to keep your Kenmore dishwasher performing its best. Let us get your dishwasher back to sparkling clean.

### Takeaway

Regularly cleaning your Kenmore dishwasher filter is essential for optimal performance.
*   A clean filter ensures sparkling dishes.
*   It prevents unpleasant odors.
*   It avoids potential drainage issues.
*   The cleaning process is simple and takes only a few minutes.

To clean the filter in your Kenmore dishwasher, first locate it at the bottom of the tub. Twist it counter-clockwise to remove the mesh and fine screen components. Rinse both parts under warm running water to remove debris. Use a soft brush and dish soap for stubborn grime. Reinstall the dry filter components by twisting clockwise until secure.

## Understanding Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter System

Your Kenmore dishwasher relies on a filter system to trap food particles. This system prevents debris from recirculating onto your dishes. It also stops particles from clogging the drain pump. Most Kenmore dishwashers use a two-part filter. This includes a cylindrical coarse filter and a flat fine filter. Knowing where to find these components is the first step.

The filter is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You will see it under the lower spray arm. Some Kenmore models have a self-cleaning filter. These models typically do not require manual cleaning as often. Most newer Kenmore dishwashers, however, have manual filters. These need regular attention. I have found checking my dishwasher filter is a quick way to diagnose cleaning problems. If you are unsure about your model, consult your appliance manual.

Identifying your specific Kenmore filter type helps in proper cleaning. The coarse filter catches larger food bits. The fine filter captures smaller particles. Both work together to keep water clean. A dirty filter leads to poor washing performance. Your dishes may come out with food residue. It can also cause a bad smell inside the dishwasher. This is because trapped food starts to decompose. Understanding the filter's role makes routine cleaning a clear necessity. Keeping this part clean is key to a functional dishwasher. You can find more information about locating your filter here: [how to find your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-your-dishwasher-filter). For specific Kenmore Elite models, refer to [where is the filter in a Kenmore elite dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-filter-in-a-kenmore-elite-dishwasher) for detailed location instructions.

Maintaining your Kenmore dishwasher filter means understanding its design. Kenmore models can vary slightly. However, the basic principle remains the same. The coarse filter is often a cylinder shape. You can twist it to unlock it. The fine filter is usually a flat mesh screen underneath. It might lift out once the coarse filter is gone. This design ensures that all sizes of food waste are captured. This protects the pump and leaves your dishes cleaner. I always make sure to visually inspect both parts. This confirms they are free from damage before cleaning. Proper care of these filters extends the life of your appliance. It also ensures consistent cleaning performance.

## Gathering Your Tools: What You Need to Clean

Before you begin cleaning your Kenmore dishwasher filter, gather the necessary supplies. Having everything ready makes the process faster and more efficient. You likely already own most of these items. No special tools are usually required. This task is simple enough for anyone to do.

You will need a few basic items. First, grab a pair of rubber gloves. This protects your hands from grime and strong cleaners. Next, get a soft-bristle brush. An old toothbrush works perfectly for scrubbing. You will also need dish soap or a mild detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. These can damage the filter material. Finally, have a clean cloth or paper towels ready for wiping. A small bowl or sink stopper can also be useful for soaking the filter parts.

Make sure your work area is clear. You might want to lay down a towel. This keeps your floor dry during the process. Having everything organized prevents interruptions. This small preparation step saves time in the long run. I always get my tools ready first. This helps me complete the job without searching for supplies mid-task. Cleaning the filter should be a straightforward maintenance chore. Proper preparation ensures it stays that way.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Remove Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter

Removing your Kenmore dishwasher filter is a straightforward process. It only takes a few simple steps. You do not need any special tools for this part. Always ensure safety first before starting any appliance maintenance. This means disconnecting power.

First, always turn off the power to your dishwasher. You can do this at the circuit breaker for your kitchen. This prevents accidental starting of the machine. It ensures your safety while you work inside the unit. Never work on an appliance with the power still connected.

Next, open the dishwasher door completely. Pull out the lower dish rack. This gives you clear access to the bottom of the dishwasher tub. The filter system is typically located in the center. Look for a cylindrical part with a handle or an arrow indicating "lock" and "unlock" positions. Most Kenmore models have a two-part filter system. The main cylindrical filter sits on top of a flat, fine mesh filter.

To remove the filter, grasp the cylindrical filter and twist it counter-clockwise. You will hear it click or feel it disengage. Once loose, gently lift it straight up and out of the dishwasher. The fine mesh filter is usually located directly underneath. It might come out with the coarse filter, or you may need to lift it separately. If it does not lift out easily, check if it has small clips or tabs. Gently disengage these if present. Be careful not to force anything. For detailed instructions on removing various filter types, check out [how to get dishwasher filter out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-dishwasher-filter-out). For Kenmore Elite models, specific steps for removal are available at [how to remove kenmore elite dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-kenmore-elite-dishwasher-filter). Once both parts are out, you are ready to clean them.

## Cleaning the Filter Components: Simple Steps for Best Results

Once you have removed your Kenmore dishwasher filter components, it is time to clean them. This step is crucial for restoring your dishwasher's performance. You want to remove all trapped food particles and grease. This will prevent bad smells and improve cleaning cycles.

Start by holding the coarse and fine filters under warm running water. Rinse away any loose food debris. You will see bits of food, labels, and other gunk wash away. It is surprising how much debris a filter can collect over time. If a lot of food is present, you might want to rinse it in a utility sink or a designated bucket. This keeps your kitchen sink cleaner.

For stubborn residue, apply a small amount of dish soap to the filters. Use your soft-bristle brush to gently scrub all surfaces. Pay close attention to the mesh screens and crevices. Food particles can get stuck in the tiny holes. A toothbrush works well for reaching these tight spots. Scrub both the inside and outside of the cylindrical filter. Also, clean both sides of the flat, fine mesh filter. Do not use abrasive pads or harsh chemicals. These can scratch or damage the filter material. Damaged filters do not trap debris effectively.

After scrubbing, rinse the filters thoroughly under warm water again. Make sure all soap residue is gone. Inspect the filters to ensure they are completely clean. Hold them up to the light to check for any remaining clogged holes. If you see any, repeat the scrubbing process. Once clean, you can let them air dry completely or wipe them with a clean cloth.

General instructions for cleaning any dishwasher filter can be found here: [how to clean filter in dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-in-dishwasher). A thoroughly cleaned filter ensures your Kenmore dishwasher operates at its best.

## Reinstalling the Filter: Proper Placement for Optimal Performance

After cleaning your Kenmore dishwasher filter, proper reinstallation is critical. Incorrect placement can lead to poor wash performance. It can also cause leaks or damage to the dishwasher. This step is just as important as the cleaning itself. Take your time to ensure everything is put back correctly.

First, make sure both the coarse filter and the fine mesh filter are completely dry. This is a good practice, though not strictly necessary. Wet components are fine, but ensure no large water droplets remain. Place the flat, fine mesh filter back into its designated spot at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It should sit flat and flush with the bottom. Some models have tabs or notches that align. Ensure these are properly seated.

Next, align the cylindrical coarse filter with the opening in the fine filter. Most Kenmore models have arrows or indicators. These show the "lock" and "unlock" positions. Insert the coarse filter into the opening. Then, twist it clockwise until it clicks into place. You should feel it lock securely. It should not be loose or wobbly. A secure fit ensures that water flows properly through the filter system. It prevents food particles from bypassing the filter.

Give the filter a gentle wiggle test. This confirms it is firmly in place. Pull the lower dish rack back into position. Close the dishwasher door. Finally, restore power to the dishwasher at the circuit breaker. You are now ready to run a wash cycle. A correctly reinstalled filter is essential for your Kenmore dishwasher to clean dishes efficiently. It also protects the pump from large debris. For a detailed guide on reinstalling your filter, refer to [how to put dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in). This simple step completes your filter maintenance.

## Maintaining Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter: How Often to Clean

Regular maintenance of your Kenmore dishwasher filter is key to its longevity and performance. Knowing how often to clean it can prevent many common dishwasher problems. The frequency depends on several factors. These include how often you use your dishwasher and what kind of food goes into it. I have found a consistent schedule works best for my home.

For most households, cleaning the Kenmore dishwasher filter once a month is a good general guideline. If you use your dishwasher daily, or if you often wash dishes with a lot of food residue, you might need to clean it more frequently. For instance, if you pre-rinse your dishes thoroughly, you might get away with cleaning it every two months. However, once a month is a safe bet for consistent results. Many sources recommend this frequency. You can find more details on this topic at [how often should you clean your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-your-dishwasher-filter).

There are clear signs that indicate your Kenmore dishwasher filter needs immediate cleaning. The most obvious sign is if your dishes are not getting clean. You might see small food particles or a gritty film left on them after a cycle. Another common indicator is a bad odor coming from the dishwasher. This smell usually comes from decaying food trapped in the filter. You might also notice standing water in the bottom of the tub. This points to potential draining issues. A dirty filter can restrict water flow to the drain pump.

I recommend a quick visual check of the filter once a week. This takes less than a minute. Just pull out the lower rack and glance at the filter. If you see visible food debris, it is time for a full cleaning. Do not wait for performance issues to arise. Proactive cleaning prevents bigger problems. Regular filter maintenance keeps your Kenmore dishwasher efficient. It also extends its lifespan. This saves you money on repairs and replacement. A clean filter ensures every wash cycle results in sparkling dishes.

## Troubleshooting Common Filter-Related Dishwasher Issues

A dirty or improperly installed Kenmore dishwasher filter can cause several problems. If your dishes are not clean or your dishwasher smells, the filter is often the culprit. Understanding these common issues helps you quickly diagnose and fix them. I have encountered many of these problems myself.

One of the most frequent complaints is poor cleaning performance. You might notice food particles on dishes. Sometimes there is a cloudy film on glassware. This happens because the dirty filter prevents proper water circulation. It also allows debris to be sprayed back onto clean dishes. The dishwasher cannot rinse effectively. Ensure your filter is clean and properly seated. This often solves the problem immediately. This is usually the first thing I check when my dishes come out dirty.

Another common issue is a bad odor. A dirty filter collects food particles. These particles decompose over time. This creates a foul smell inside the dishwasher. Cleaning the filter regularly eliminates this source of odor. Sometimes, food can get trapped in other parts of the dishwasher too. However, the filter is the most common place. Some Kenmore models, like the Ultra Wash, might have specific filter designs. For cleaning tips on those, check out [how to clean kenmore ultra wash dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-kenmore-ultra-wash-dishwasher-filter). Similarly, if you have a Kenmore 665 model, specific instructions can be found at [how to clean kenmore dishwasher filter 665](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-kenmore-dishwasher-filter-665).

Finally, a dirty filter can lead to drainage problems. If your Kenmore dishwasher is not draining properly, the filter might be blocked. This prevents water from reaching the drain pump efficiently. You might see standing water at the bottom of the tub after a cycle. A completely clogged filter can cause the pump to work harder or even fail. Cleaning the filter is the first step in troubleshooting drainage issues. For more detailed help on this specific problem, refer to [why does my kenmore dishwasher not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kenmore-dishwasher-not-drain). Always check the filter before calling a technician for these common issues. A simple cleaning can save you time and money.
