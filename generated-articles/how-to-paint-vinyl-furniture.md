## Transform Your Home: How To Paint Vinyl Furniture

Have you looked at your vinyl furniture recently? Perhaps its color has faded. Maybe the style does not match your home anymore. You might feel ready for a change. Painting vinyl furniture is a smart way to give old pieces a fresh new look. It saves money compared to buying new items.

Many people think painting vinyl is impossible. They worry about paint chipping or peeling. With the right steps and products, you can achieve a durable, beautiful finish. This guide will show you exactly how to paint vinyl furniture. We will cover preparing the surface, selecting the right paint, and applying it correctly. You will learn how to make your painted vinyl furniture last. Get ready to refresh your space with confidence.

### Takeaway

Painting vinyl furniture is a budget-friendly way to update your home. Success depends on careful preparation and the right materials.

*   Clean and repair the vinyl surface thoroughly.
*   Choose a flexible, durable paint made for vinyl or fabric.
*   Apply multiple thin coats for a smooth, lasting finish.
*   Allow proper drying and curing time before use.

### The Simple Answer: Painting Vinyl Furniture

You can paint vinyl furniture. The key is proper surface preparation, including thorough cleaning and light sanding. Use a specialized primer and flexible paint, like acrylic latex or dedicated vinyl/fabric paint, for strong adhesion and a durable finish.

## Understanding Vinyl Furniture and Paint Adhesion Challenges

Vinyl furniture offers comfort and resilience. This material is popular for its durability and ease of care. Over time, however, vinyl can look worn or outdated. Its color may fade. Scuffs and marks can accumulate. Painting offers a great solution. You can refresh the look of your vinyl furniture easily.

Vinyl presents unique challenges for paint adhesion. The surface is often non-porous. This means paint does not soak into it like wood. Paint must bond directly to the surface. It needs to stick well to prevent peeling or cracking. Vinyl also has flexibility. It stretches and moves with use. The paint must be flexible too. A rigid paint will crack when the vinyl bends. Understanding these facts helps you choose the correct products and methods. This knowledge ensures a lasting, beautiful finish on your painted vinyl furniture.

### Why Painting Vinyl Is a Great Idea

Painting vinyl furniture allows for complete customization. You can match existing decor or create a new style. This process is much cheaper than buying new furniture. It also extends the life of your current pieces. Giving furniture a new look reduces waste. This makes painting a sustainable choice.

You can save significant money. A fresh coat of paint transforms a dated item. It gives it a modern or classic appeal. This is a practical solution for homeowners on a budget. It adds value to your furniture without major spending. This approach promotes resourcefulness and creativity.

### Common Vinyl Types and Their Paintability

Several types of vinyl exist. Each has slightly different properties. Most vinyl furniture is PVC-based. This material is generally paintable. Some vinyl might have a glossy or slick coating. This coating needs extra preparation. You might need a stronger primer for very slick surfaces.

Textured vinyl also exists. It can hold paint well but might require more coats. Always test paint in a hidden area first. This helps you check for good adhesion. It confirms the paint will work as expected on your specific furniture. Different vinyl types may react differently to paint. Testing prevents problems later.

### The Science of Paint Adhesion on Flexible Surfaces

Paint adhesion on flexible surfaces relies on chemical and mechanical bonds. A good primer creates a sticky layer. This layer gives the paint something to grab onto. Light sanding or scuffing the vinyl surface helps. It creates tiny scratches. These scratches provide mechanical grip for the primer and paint. The paint itself must be elastic. It needs to stretch without breaking.

Paints designed for vinyl or fabric contain special polymers. These polymers give the paint flexibility. They prevent it from becoming brittle. This flexibility is critical for furniture that bends or moves. Choosing the right paint ensures the finish stays intact. It resists cracking and peeling over time.

## Essential Materials and Tools for Painting Vinyl

Starting a painting project needs the right tools. Having everything ready saves time and effort. For painting vinyl furniture, specific items work best. These items ensure your project goes smoothly. They help you achieve a high-quality, durable finish. I always gather my supplies beforehand. This way, I avoid interruptions once I start working.

Your choice of tools directly affects the outcome. High-quality brushes and rollers provide smooth application. The right cleaners and primers ensure strong paint adhesion. Do not skip any steps in preparing your workspace or materials. A well-prepared project is a successful project.

### Cleaning Supplies for Vinyl Preparation

Clean vinyl furniture is crucial for paint adhesion. Dirt, grime, and oils will prevent paint from sticking. You need a good cleaner. I recommend a mild detergent and warm water. You can also use a specialized vinyl cleaner. These products remove stubborn dirt without harming the vinyl.

*   **Mild soap or cleaner:** Dish soap works well for general cleaning. For tougher stains, use a dedicated [vinyl furniture cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-vinyl-furniture).
*   **Soft cloths or sponges:** Use these to scrub the surface gently.
*   **Bucket:** For mixing your cleaning solution.
*   **Water:** For rinsing the furniture thoroughly.
*   **Towel:** To dry the furniture completely. Ensure no moisture remains before painting.

### Repair Materials for Damaged Vinyl

Inspect your vinyl furniture for tears or cracks. Small damages can be repaired before painting. Repairing ensures a smooth, even surface. This step also prevents further damage. You will need specific products for vinyl repair.

*   **Vinyl repair kit:** These kits usually contain liquid vinyl and patches.
*   **Applicator tool:** Often included in repair kits, for spreading the repair compound.
*   **Sandpaper (fine-grit):** To smooth out any repaired areas.
*   **Rubbing alcohol:** To clean the area before applying the repair kit.

### Sanding and Scuffing Tools

Light sanding or scuffing helps paint adhere. It creates a textured surface for the primer to grip. You do not need heavy-duty sanding. A fine-grit sandpaper is enough. This step is important for non-porous materials like vinyl.

*   **Fine-grit sandpaper (220-320 grit):** Use this to lightly abrade the surface.
*   **Sanding sponge:** Offers better control on contoured surfaces.
*   **Tack cloth:** To remove sanding dust completely.

### Primer and Paint Choices for Vinyl Furniture

Selecting the right primer and paint is critical. Not all paints work on vinyl. You need products designed for flexible surfaces. Look for specific labels.

*   **Adhesion primer:** Choose a primer made for slick or difficult surfaces. Some primers are specifically for plastic or vinyl. This provides a strong base for your paint.
*   **Flexible paint:**
    *   **Acrylic latex paint with a bonding additive:** This type of [latex paint](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-furniture-with-latex-paint) is flexible and durable. Mix in a flexible additive for better performance on vinyl.
    *   **Specialized vinyl or fabric paint:** These paints are formulated to adhere and flex with vinyl. They are often found in spray cans or larger containers. Brands like SEM ColorCoat or Rust-Oleum Fabric & Vinyl are good examples.
    *   **Marine-grade vinyl paint:** If your furniture is outdoors or in high-moisture areas, consider marine-grade options. They offer superior water resistance and UV protection.
*   **Paint brushes:** High-quality synthetic brushes for smooth application.
*   **Foam rollers:** Good for large, flat surfaces, providing an even coat.
*   **Spray gun (optional):** For a professional, even finish, especially on detailed pieces.

### Sealer or Topcoat Options

A topcoat protects your painted vinyl. It adds durability and wear resistance. Choose a flexible topcoat for the best results.

*   **Clear flexible topcoat:** A clear coat designed for vinyl or fabric. This seals the paint. It protects against scuffs and scratches.
*   **UV protectant spray:** If the furniture will be outdoors, a UV protectant helps prevent fading.

### Protective Gear and Workspace Setup

Protect yourself and your surroundings. Painting can be messy. Proper setup makes clean-up easier.

*   **Drop cloths or old sheets:** To cover floors and nearby objects.
*   **Painter's tape:** To mask off areas you do not want to paint. Use good quality tape for crisp lines.
*   **Gloves:** To protect your hands from paint and chemicals.
*   **Mask or respirator:** Essential for ventilation, especially when using spray paints or strong primers.
*   **Well-ventilated area:** Work outdoors or in a garage with open windows. Good airflow is important for drying and safety.

Gathering these materials upfront ensures a smooth and successful painting project.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Preparing Vinyl Furniture for Painting

Preparing your vinyl furniture is the most important step. Proper preparation ensures the paint sticks well. It helps the finish last a long time. Do not rush this part. I always take my time with prep. This makes the painting part much easier and more effective. A clean, smooth surface is key to success.

### Deep Cleaning Your Vinyl Furniture

Start by cleaning your vinyl furniture thoroughly. Dust, grime, and body oils build up over time. These substances prevent paint from adhering. Use a mild soap or a specialized [vinyl cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-vinyl-furniture).

1.  **Remove loose debris:** Vacuum or brush off any loose dirt, crumbs, or pet hair.
2.  **Wash with soap and water:** Mix a few drops of mild dish soap with warm water. Dip a soft cloth into the solution. Wipe down the entire surface of the vinyl furniture. Pay attention to seams and crevices. For tougher stains, use a dedicated vinyl cleaning solution.
3.  **Scrub gently:** Use a soft-bristled brush for stubborn spots. Avoid harsh scrubbers that can damage the vinyl.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Wipe the furniture with a clean, damp cloth. Remove all soap residue. Leftover soap can interfere with paint adhesion. Rinse multiple times if needed.
5.  **Dry completely:** Use a clean, dry towel to pat the surface dry. Allow the furniture to air dry for several hours. Ensure there is no moisture left. Moisture under paint can cause bubbling or peeling.

### Repairing Tears and Imperfections

Inspect your vinyl furniture for any damage. Small tears, cracks, or holes need repair before painting. Repairing these flaws creates a smooth, even surface. It also prevents further damage or paint issues.

1.  **Clean the damaged area:** Use rubbing alcohol to clean around the tear or hole. This removes any oils or residues.
2.  **Apply vinyl repair compound:** Follow the instructions on your vinyl repair kit. Typically, you apply a liquid vinyl compound to the damaged area. Use a small applicator tool to spread it evenly.
3.  **Patch larger holes (if necessary):** Some kits include a patch for larger holes. Apply the patch, then cover it with the repair compound.
4.  **Allow to cure:** Let the repair compound dry completely. This might take several hours. Check the product instructions for specific drying times.
5.  **Sand smooth:** Once dry, lightly sand the repaired area with fine-grit sandpaper (220-grit). Blend the repair into the surrounding vinyl. Wipe away any dust with a tack cloth.

### Light Sanding or Scuffing the Surface

This step is vital for paint adhesion. Vinyl is a smooth, non-porous material. Paint struggles to stick to smooth surfaces. Lightly sanding creates a "tooth" for the primer and paint to grip.

1.  **Choose fine-grit sandpaper:** Use 220 to 320-grit sandpaper or a sanding sponge. You want to scuff the surface, not remove material.
2.  **Gently abrade the entire surface:** Rub the sandpaper over all areas you plan to paint. Apply light, even pressure. You should see a dulling of the shiny vinyl surface. Do not sand through the vinyl. Just create a slight texture.
3.  **Focus on hard-to-reach areas:** Use a sanding sponge or folded sandpaper for corners and details.
4.  **Wipe away dust:** Use a tack cloth or a damp cloth to remove all sanding dust. Dust will prevent paint from sticking. Ensure the surface is completely clean and dust-free before priming.

### Masking and Protecting Adjacent Areas

Protect surfaces you do not want to paint. This includes trim, zippers, or adjacent furniture. Painter's tape is your best friend here.

1.  **Apply painter's tape:** Use high-quality painter's tape along edges. Press firmly to create a clean line.
2.  **Cover with drop cloths:** Lay drop cloths or old sheets over the floor and any nearby items. This protects against drips and overspray.
3.  **Remove detachable parts:** If possible, remove cushions, legs, or hardware. This makes painting easier and ensures a cleaner finish. If parts cannot be removed, tape them thoroughly.

Once these preparation steps are complete, your vinyl furniture is ready for primer and paint. Taking the time for proper prep will significantly improve the quality and longevity of your painted finish.

## Choosing the Best Paint for Vinyl Furniture

Choosing the right paint for vinyl furniture is as important as the preparation. Vinyl is flexible and non-porous. This means not just any paint will work. The paint needs to bond well and remain flexible. Picking the correct type prevents issues like cracking, peeling, or a sticky finish. I research paint types carefully for each project. This ensures a durable and beautiful result.

### Understanding Primer for Vinyl

Primer is a foundational coat. It creates a surface that paint can stick to. For vinyl, a specialized primer is essential. It acts as a bridge between the slick vinyl and your chosen paint. Without primer, paint may peel off quickly.

*   **Adhesion primer:** Look for primers specifically designed for slick surfaces, plastics, or vinyl. These primers contain special resins that grip difficult materials.
*   **Flexibility:** Some primers offer flexibility. This is a bonus for vinyl furniture that flexes.
*   **Tinted primers:** If you are painting a dark color over light vinyl, a gray or tinted primer can help. It provides a more uniform base color. This reduces the number of paint coats needed.
*   **Application:** Apply primer in a thin, even coat. Allow it to dry completely. Follow the manufacturer's drying time recommendations.

### Top Paint Options for Vinyl Furniture

Several paint types can work on vinyl. Each has its pros and cons. Consider durability, finish, and ease of application.

1.  **Specialized Vinyl/Fabric Paint:**
    *   **What it is:** These paints are specifically formulated for flexible materials like vinyl, fabric, and leather. They contain additives that ensure flexibility and adhesion.
    *   **Pros:** Designed for the job, excellent flexibility, good adhesion, often quick-drying. Available in aerosol cans or brush-on formulas.
    *   **Cons:** Color options might be limited compared to general paints. Can be more expensive.
    *   **Example brands:** SEM ColorCoat, Rust-Oleum Fabric & Vinyl Paint.
    *   **Best for:** Upholstered vinyl furniture, items that flex often, for a professional factory-like finish.

2.  **Acrylic Latex Paint with a Bonding Additive:**
    *   **What it is:** High-quality interior/exterior acrylic latex paint mixed with a flexible or bonding additive. This additive improves adhesion and elasticity.
    *   **Pros:** Wide range of colors available. Good durability when properly applied. Relatively easy to clean. Can be [painted over other furniture types](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-furniture-with-latex-paint) too.
    *   **Cons:** Requires mixing an additive. Not specifically designed for vinyl, so adhesion might be slightly less than dedicated vinyl paint without proper prep and additive use.
    *   **Additive examples:** Floetrol (improves flow and flexibility), various bonding primers/additives designed for difficult surfaces.
    *   **Best for:** Rigid vinyl furniture, cases where specific color matching is needed, those comfortable with mixing products.

3.  **Chalk Paint (with specific preparation):**
    *   **What it is:** A matte-finish paint known for its no-sanding properties on many surfaces. However, for vinyl, extra steps are necessary.
    *   **Pros:** No-prep claim for some surfaces (but not vinyl!), unique matte finish, good color range.
    *   **Cons:** Not inherently flexible. Requires an excellent adhesion primer and a flexible topcoat to prevent cracking on vinyl. May not be as durable for high-traffic vinyl.
    *   **Best for:** Decorative vinyl pieces that see minimal use and where a matte, distressed look is desired. Not ideal for high-flex vinyl upholstery.

4.  **Spray Paint for Plastics/Vinyl:**
    *   **What it is:** Aerosol spray paints formulated to adhere to plastic and vinyl. They offer a smooth, even finish.
    *   **Pros:** Easy to apply, provides a very smooth, factory-like finish. Quick-drying.
    *   **Cons:** Can be challenging to control for beginners. Requires good ventilation. Limited color selection compared to brush-on paints. Can be expensive for large projects.
    *   **Example brands:** Krylon Fusion All-In-One, Rust-Oleum Painter's Touch 2X Ultra Cover (for plastics).
    *   **Best for:** Smaller vinyl pieces, chairs (like how you might [paint a vinyl chair](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-a-vinyl-chair)), or intricate designs where a smooth finish is critical. Also suitable for [plastic lawn furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-plastic-lawn-furniture).

### Considerations When Choosing Paint

*   **Flexibility:** This is the most important factor for vinyl furniture that bends.
*   **Durability:** How much wear and tear will the furniture see? Choose a paint that can withstand its intended use.
*   **Finish:** Do you want a matte, satin, or glossy look?
*   **Color Range:** Does the paint come in the color you desire?
*   **Application Method:** Do you prefer brushing, rolling, or spraying?
*   **Drying and Curing Time:** How long do you need to wait before using the furniture?

Always read the paint manufacturer's instructions. They often provide specific advice for different surfaces. Testing a small, hidden area of your vinyl furniture with your chosen primer and paint is always a good idea. This confirms compatibility and final appearance before you commit to the whole project.

## Application Techniques: Painting Vinyl Furniture for a Flawless Finish

Applying paint to vinyl furniture requires careful technique. It is not just about slapping paint on. Thin, even coats are essential for a durable and professional-looking finish. Rushing this step can lead to drips, uneven color, or poor adhesion. I always focus on patience during this stage. It pays off with beautiful results.

### Priming Your Vinyl Furniture

Priming is your first step after preparing the surface. This creates a strong base for your paint. It helps the paint stick and provides a uniform color foundation.

1.  **Ensure ventilation:** Work in a well-ventilated area. Open windows or use fans.
2.  **Apply thin coats:** Use a brush, roller, or spray gun. Apply one thin, even coat of your chosen adhesion primer. Avoid thick coats, as they can bubble or take too long to dry.
3.  **Cover evenly:** Make sure the primer covers all areas you plan to paint. Pay attention to corners and edges.
4.  **Dry completely:** Allow the primer to dry for the recommended time. This is often 2-4 hours, but check your product's label. Do not rush to the next step.
5.  **Light sand (optional):** If the primer feels rough, you can lightly sand it with 320-grit sandpaper. This creates an even smoother surface for your paint. Wipe away dust with a tack cloth.
6.  **Second primer coat (if needed):** For very dark vinyl or if the first coat is uneven, apply a second thin coat of primer. Dry thoroughly again.

### Applying Your Chosen Vinyl Paint

Now for the color! Remember the key principle: several thin coats are better than one thick coat. Thin coats dry faster, adhere better, and are less likely to peel.

1.  **Mix paint thoroughly:** Stir your paint well before starting. If using a flexible additive, mix it in according to the product instructions.
2.  **First thin coat:**
    *   **Brush/Roller:** Load your brush or roller sparingly. Apply a very thin, even coat. Work in one direction, overlapping strokes slightly.
    *   **Spray Paint:** Hold the can 10-12 inches from the surface. Use a steady, sweeping motion. Apply very light, even coats. Avoid holding the spray in one spot. This prevents drips.
    *   **Coverage:** Do not aim for full coverage with the first coat. It will look translucent. This is normal.
3.  **Dry between coats:** Allow each coat to dry completely. This is crucial for adhesion. Drying times vary, but often range from 2-4 hours for brush/roller paints, and 15-30 minutes for spray paints. Check manufacturer instructions.
4.  **Subsequent coats:** Apply additional thin coats. Build up the color gradually. Most projects require 2-4 coats for full, opaque coverage. Each coat should dry fully before the next.
5.  **Smooth finish:** For a very smooth finish, you can lightly sand between coats with 320-grit sandpaper. This is optional but can eliminate minor imperfections. Always wipe off dust with a tack cloth.
6.  **Consider specific furniture:** When painting a [vinyl chair](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-a-vinyl-chair), pay attention to the seams and curved areas. For larger, flat pieces, a roller gives a more even finish. Cabinets made of vinyl might need a slightly different approach than flexible seating, but the general rules of prep and thin coats still apply (see [painting vinyl cabinets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-vinyl-cabinets)).

### Tips for a Smooth, Durable Finish

*   **Work in ideal conditions:** Paint in moderate temperatures (60-80°F / 15-27°C) and low humidity. Extreme temperatures or humidity can affect drying and adhesion.
*   **Maintain even pressure:** Whether brushing or spraying, keep your hand steady. This ensures consistent paint thickness.
*   **Avoid overworking the paint:** Do not brush or roll too much over an area. This can create streaks or remove wet paint. Apply and move on.
*   **Check for drips:** Inspect your work after each coat. Smooth out any drips or runs immediately while the paint is wet.
*   **Patience is key:** The most common mistake is rushing. Allow adequate drying time between coats and before applying a topcoat.

Following these application techniques will help you achieve a professional-looking and long-lasting painted finish on your vinyl furniture.

## Sealing and Curing Your Painted Vinyl Furniture

You have done the hard work of preparing and painting. Now, you must protect your new finish. Sealing and proper curing are crucial steps. They ensure your painted vinyl furniture stands up to daily use. Skipping these steps can lead to premature wear, chipping, or a sticky surface. I consider these final steps non-negotiable for a lasting project.

### Applying a Protective Topcoat

A topcoat, also called a sealer or clear coat, adds durability. It protects the paint from scratches, scuffs, and fading. For vinyl furniture, choose a topcoat that remains flexible.

1.  **Ensure paint is fully dry:** Wait until your final paint coat is completely dry. This means dry to the touch, not just superficially. Check the paint manufacturer's recommendation for recoat time, which can be several hours or even overnight.
2.  **Choose a flexible topcoat:** Select a clear topcoat designed for flexible surfaces, plastics, or vinyl. Polyurethane or acrylic clear coats designed for exterior use or high-traffic surfaces can work well if they state flexibility. Avoid rigid clear coats, as they will crack with vinyl's movement.
3.  **Apply thin, even coats:** Like paint, apply the topcoat in thin layers. Use a brush, foam roller, or spray gun. A roller gives a very smooth finish on flat surfaces. Spraying is excellent for even coverage on detailed areas.
4.  **Number of coats:** One or two coats are usually sufficient for protection. If the furniture will see heavy use, a third coat might be beneficial.
5.  **Dry between coats:** Allow each topcoat layer to dry completely before applying the next. This prevents tackiness and ensures proper adhesion.
6.  **Check finish:** After the final coat, inspect the surface for evenness and clarity. A good topcoat should be invisible or enhance the paint's sheen.

### Understanding Curing Time

Drying and curing are different. Drying means the paint feels dry to the touch. Curing means the paint has fully hardened and reached its maximum durability. This chemical process takes longer. Using furniture too soon can damage the new finish.

*   **Patience is a virtue:** Most paints and topcoats require a full curing period. This can range from a few days to several weeks. Check the product label for specific curing times.
*   **Light use first:** During the initial curing period (e.g., the first 2-3 days), try to use the furniture lightly. Avoid heavy pressure, sliding objects, or placing hot items on the surface.
*   **Full cure for heavy use:** Wait for the full curing time before the furniture sees regular, heavy use. This ensures the paint is as hard and durable as possible.
*   **Environmental factors:** Humidity and temperature affect curing. Higher humidity or lower temperatures can extend curing times.

### Maintaining Your Painted Vinyl Furniture

Proper maintenance helps your newly painted furniture last even longer.

1.  **Gentle cleaning:** Clean your painted vinyl furniture with a soft, damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or scrub brushes. These can scratch or dull the finish.
2.  **Avoid sharp objects:** Be careful with sharp objects that could scratch or puncture the paint.
3.  **Protect from direct sun:** If possible, keep painted vinyl furniture out of direct, prolonged sunlight. UV rays can cause paint to fade over time, even with a UV-resistant topcoat.
4.  **Use coasters/pads:** For tables or surfaces, use coasters under drinks and felt pads under objects. This prevents marks or heat damage.
5.  **Regular inspection:** Periodically check your furniture for any signs of wear. Catching minor issues early can prevent them from becoming bigger problems. If you see peeling or chipping, you might need to touch up the area. This is a common issue that can happen on surfaces like [vinyl cabinets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-peeling-vinyl-cabinets) as well. The repair principles are often similar.

By following these sealing, curing, and maintenance steps, your painted vinyl furniture will remain beautiful and functional for years to come.

## Troubleshooting Common Vinyl Furniture Painting Issues

Even with careful planning, sometimes issues arise during painting. It is good to know how to fix them. Understanding common problems helps you avoid them in the first place. I have faced many challenges over my painting projects. Learning from them helps me share solutions with you. Do not let small problems discourage you.

### Paint Peeling or Flaking

Paint peeling off vinyl is a sign of poor adhesion. This usually happens because of inadequate preparation.

*   **Problem:** The paint lifts away from the vinyl surface, often in flakes or sheets.
*   **Cause:**
    *   **Improper cleaning:** Dirt, grease, or residue was left on the vinyl.
    *   **No sanding/scuffing:** The vinyl surface was too smooth for paint to grip.
    *   **Wrong primer:** An unsuitable primer was used, or no primer at all.
    *   **In
