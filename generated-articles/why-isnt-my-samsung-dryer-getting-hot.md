## Why Your Samsung Dryer Isn't Heating Clothes

It is frustrating when your Samsung dryer runs but does not heat. Your clothes remain damp, and laundry piles up. You expect your dryer to provide hot air for proper drying. When this does not happen, it stops your laundry routine.

This issue can stem from several causes. These range from simple clogs to failed components. We will explore common reasons why a Samsung dryer stops getting hot. I will give clear steps to help you identify and fix the problem. My goal is to get your Samsung dryer working well again.

### Takeaway

If your Samsung dryer is not getting hot, consider these key solutions:
*   Check and clean the dryer vent system thoroughly.
*   Inspect the thermal fuse for continuity and replace it if blown.
*   Test the heating element or gas igniter for breaks or malfunctions.
*   Verify power supply and circuit breakers for electric models.
*   Examine thermostats for proper function and replace if faulty.

A Samsung dryer often fails to produce heat due to a blown thermal fuse, a faulty heating element, or a severely blocked dryer vent. Other reasons include issues with the igniter in gas models, a tripped circuit breaker, or defective thermostats that regulate temperature.

## Understanding Your Samsung Dryer's Heating System

Your Samsung dryer uses a simple process to dry clothes. It draws in air, heats it, and then sends this hot air through the drum. This hot air absorbs moisture from your wet clothes. The moist air then exits through the dryer's vent system. This cycle repeats until clothes are dry. When your dryer stops heating, it means one part of this process has failed.

Electric Samsung dryers use a large coil known as the heating element. Electricity flows through this coil, making it very hot. A fan blows air over this hot coil, and that air goes into the drum. This design is common and simple. If the heating element breaks, the dryer will not produce heat. It will continue to tumble clothes, but they will stay wet.

Gas Samsung dryers use a different method. They have a gas burner that ignites gas to create heat. An igniter gets hot, which lights the gas. A flame then heats the air entering the drum. These dryers also have flame sensors and solenoids that control gas flow. If the igniter fails or gas flow is blocked, the dryer will not get hot. Both electric and gas dryers rely on good airflow and functional safety components to heat correctly.

## The Common Culprit: Clogged Dryer Vents

A clogged dryer vent is a very common reason for a dryer not to heat. Lint from clothes builds up in the vent hose and ductwork over time. This lint acts like insulation. It traps hot air inside the dryer and prevents it from escaping. When hot air cannot leave, the dryer's internal temperature rises too high. Safety devices then shut off the heat to prevent overheating and fire.

This lint buildup restricts airflow. Good airflow is vital for proper drying. If air cannot move freely, the dryer cannot get rid of moisture. It also cannot bring in fresh, cool air to heat. The dryer may still tumble, but clothes will take a very long time to dry, or they will not dry at all. Reduced airflow also makes the dryer work harder, which wastes energy and shortens the dryer's life.

To check for a clogged vent, feel the vent exhaust outside your house. If little or no air comes out, or if it is not hot, your vent is likely clogged. You can disconnect the vent hose from the back of the dryer. Look inside for visible lint blockages. A special vent cleaning brush can reach deep into the ductwork. I recommend cleaning your dryer vent at least once a year. This prevents heating problems and reduces fire risk. For similar issues across different brands, knowing how to clear vents is a universal fix, much like [why an electric dryer isn't getting hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-isnt-my-electric-dryer-getting-hot).

## Troubleshooting Electrical Components: Thermal Fuse and Thermostat

When your Samsung dryer is not getting hot, electrical components are often the cause. The thermal fuse is a common culprit. This small, one-time safety device protects the dryer from overheating. If the temperature inside the dryer gets too high, the thermal fuse blows. This breaks the electrical circuit to the heating element, stopping the heat. A blown thermal fuse means there was an underlying issue causing the dryer to overheat. This issue is often a clogged vent.

To check the thermal fuse, you must disconnect the dryer from power. Then, access the fuse, usually located on the blower housing or heating element assembly. Use a multimeter set to continuity mode. Touch the probes to each terminal of the fuse. If the multimeter shows no continuity (an open circuit), the fuse is blown and needs replacement. A new thermal fuse is generally inexpensive. Replacing it is a straightforward repair for many.

Thermostats also control heat in your dryer. Samsung dryers have several thermostats. The operating thermostat turns the heating element on and off to maintain the desired temperature. A hi-limit thermostat acts as a secondary safety. If the operating thermostat fails and temperatures rise dangerously high, the hi-limit thermostat opens the circuit. These components can fail over time. You can test thermostats for continuity with a multimeter. If a thermostat shows no continuity at room temperature, it is faulty and needs replacement. Ensuring these parts work helps your dryer maintain correct drying temperatures.

## Heating Element or Gas Igniter Issues

The heating element is crucial for electric Samsung dryers. It is a long, coiled wire that glows red hot when working. Over time, this coil can break. A break in the coil means electricity cannot flow through it. If electricity cannot flow, the element cannot heat up. Your dryer will still tumble, but it will only blow cool air. This is a very common reason for a Samsung electric dryer to not produce heat.

To check the heating element, unplug the dryer from power. You will need to remove the back panel of the dryer to access it. Visually inspect the element coil for any visible breaks or dark spots. Even if it looks fine, it might still be faulty. Use a multimeter set to ohms (resistance) to test it. Place the probes on the two terminals of the heating element. A good heating element will show a resistance reading, usually between 8 and 12 ohms. If the multimeter shows an open circuit (OL or infinity), the element is broken and needs replacement. Replacing a heating element is a common repair and parts are widely available.

For Samsung gas dryers, the igniter is the key component for heat. The igniter is a small, glowing part that heats up to ignite the gas. If the igniter is faulty, it will not glow hot enough, or at all. This means the gas will not ignite, and no heat will be produced. You might hear the dryer trying to start, but no flame appears. Sometimes the igniter glows, but it is too weak to ignite the gas. In such cases, the igniter still needs replacement. You can test the igniter's resistance with a multimeter. Always turn off the gas supply and unplug the dryer before working on gas components.

## Control Board and Sensor Malfunctions

Less common, but still possible, are issues with the control board or temperature sensors. The main control board is the brain of your Samsung dryer. It sends commands to all dryer components, including the heating system. If the control board malfunctions, it may not send the correct voltage to the heating element or igniter. This can result in no heat or inconsistent heating. A damaged control board might show error codes on the display, but not always. Sometimes, simply resetting the dryer by unplugging it for a few minutes can fix minor board glitches.

Temperature sensors, also called thermistors, monitor the air temperature inside the dryer. They send this information back to the control board. The control board uses these readings to regulate the heating cycle. If a temperature sensor is faulty, it might give incorrect readings. For example, it could tell the control board that the dryer is already hot enough when it is not. This would cause the control board to turn off the heat prematurely or not turn it on at all.

Testing a thermistor usually involves checking its resistance with a multimeter. The resistance changes with temperature. You can often find charts online that show the expected resistance values at different temperatures for your specific Samsung dryer model. If the sensor's reading is far off, it may be bad. Replacing a sensor is typically easier than replacing a control board. However, control board issues often require a professional technician because they can be complex to diagnose and costly to replace.

## Power Supply Problems for Electric Dryers

An electric Samsung dryer needs a correct power supply to heat. Most electric dryers require a 240-volt dedicated circuit. This circuit uses two hot wires, a neutral wire, and a ground wire. If one of the hot wires loses power, the dryer will run, but it will not heat. The motor and lights might work on 120 volts, which is what one hot wire and the neutral wire provide. But the heating element needs the full 240 volts.

Check your home's circuit breaker box first. Find the breaker for your dryer. It is usually a double-pole breaker, meaning it takes up two slots and has a single handle. If it is tripped, it will be in the middle position or fully off. Flip it completely off, then flip it firmly back to the "on" position. If it immediately trips again, there is a short circuit or an overloaded line, and you should call an electrician.

Also, inspect the dryer's power cord and the wall outlet. Make sure the cord is fully plugged in. Check for any visible damage to the cord or prongs. Sometimes, the dryer outlet itself can fail. You can use a voltage tester to verify that 240 volts are present at the outlet. If the outlet has no power or incorrect voltage, the problem is with your home's electrical wiring, not the dryer itself. In such a case, do not try to fix it yourself unless you are a qualified electrician. Problems with power are a common theme across many appliances, including when [a Whirlpool dryer isn't getting hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-isnt-my-whirlpool-dryer-getting-hot).

## Gas Supply Issues for Gas Dryers

If you have a Samsung gas dryer that is not heating, the problem might be with its gas supply. A gas dryer needs a steady supply of natural gas or liquid propane (LP) to operate correctly. Without gas, the igniter will glow, but there will be no flame to produce heat. It is a common oversight to check gas supply only after other dryer components.

First, ensure the gas shut-off valve is fully open. This valve is usually behind the dryer, on the gas line connected to the appliance. Sometimes, it gets accidentally turned off during cleaning or moving the dryer. Make sure the handle is parallel with the gas pipe for it to be open. If it is perpendicular, it is closed.

Next, check if other gas appliances in your home are working. For instance, try lighting a burner on your gas stove. If other gas appliances are not working, the problem could be with your home's main gas supply. This might indicate an issue with your gas meter or a service interruption from your gas provider. In such cases, contact your gas company immediately.

If other gas appliances work, but your dryer still does not heat, the issue might be with the gas valve solenoids on the dryer itself. These solenoids open and close to allow gas to flow to the burner. If one or more solenoids fail, gas will not reach the igniter. You can test gas valve solenoids for continuity with a multimeter. However, working with gas lines and components requires caution. If you are not comfortable, it is best to call a professional appliance technician or a licensed gas fitter to diagnose and fix gas-related issues.
