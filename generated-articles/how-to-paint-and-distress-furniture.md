This guide provides a step-by-step approach to painting and distressing furniture. We will explore essential preparation, paint selection, application techniques, and various distressing methods. You will learn how to achieve a beautiful, aged finish. Get ready to transform your furniture into unique statement pieces.

### Takeaway:

*   Prepare furniture properly by cleaning, sanding, and priming for best paint adhesion.
*   Choose the right paint type, such as chalk paint or milk paint, for ease of distressing.
*   Apply paint evenly using brushes, rollers, or sprayers, allowing for proper drying between coats.

To paint and distress furniture, begin by cleaning and preparing the surface, then apply your chosen paint in thin, even coats. Once dry, use sanding, wet distressing, or chipping tools to create an aged look. Finally, seal the piece to protect the finish and enhance its durability.

I always inspect my furniture for damage before starting. Look for loose joints, cracks, or missing hardware. Repair these issues first. This ensures a stable and beautiful finished product. Your preparation makes a big difference.

### Essential Paint Types for Distressing

Selecting the correct paint makes distressing much easier. Certain paints naturally lend themselves to an aged look. I often choose between chalk paint, milk paint, and sometimes latex paint. Each offers unique properties for distressing.
