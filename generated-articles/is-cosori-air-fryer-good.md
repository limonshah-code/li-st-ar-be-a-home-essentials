The construction materials play a big role in durability. Cosori uses a combination of metals and plastics. These are chosen for their heat resistance and safety.

## Common Cosori Air Fryer Issues and Troubleshooting Tips

Even the best appliances can have occasional issues. Cosori air fryers are generally reliable. However, users sometimes encounter minor problems. Knowing common issues and how to fix them can save you time and frustration. I have experienced a few of these myself and found simple solutions.

### Why is My Cosori Air Fryer Not Heating Up?

This is a frustrating issue. Your air fryer turns on, but the food stays cold. Several reasons can cause this.

*   **Power Supply:**
    *   Check if the air fryer is fully plugged into a working outlet. A loose plug can prevent heating.
    *   Ensure the outlet itself has power. Try plugging in another appliance.
    *   Avoid using extension cords that are not rated for high wattage. Air fryers draw a lot of power.
*   **Basket Not Fully Inserted:**
    *   Most air fryers have a safety switch. The unit will not heat if the basket is not fully pushed in. Make sure it clicks into place.
*   **Overheat Protection:**
    *   Air fryers have a thermal cut-off. This prevents overheating. If the unit gets too hot, it will shut down. Unplug the air fryer. Let it cool for 30 minutes. Then plug it back in and try again.
*   **Faulty Heating Element:**
    *   This is less common. If none of the above fixes work, the heating element might be faulty. In this case, contact Cosori customer support.

### Why Does My Cosori Air Fryer Smell?

A new air fryer might produce a "new appliance" smell. This usually goes away after a few uses. However, persistent or unusual smells need attention.

*   **New Appliance Smell:**
    *   When first used, the heating elements and materials off-gas harmlessly. This is normal.
    *   Run the air fryer empty at a high temperature for 10-15 minutes. Do this a few times before cooking food. Open a window for ventilation.
*   **Food Residue/Grease Buildup:**
    *   This is the most common cause of a bad smell. Old food particles or grease can burn.
    *   Thoroughly clean the basket, crisper plate, and inside of the air fryer. Pay attention to the heating coil.
    *   Make sure all parts are completely dry before use.
*   **Plastic Burning Smell:**
    *   If you smell burning plastic, unplug the unit immediately.
    *   Check for any plastic packaging that might have been left inside.
    *   Ensure no plastic accessories are touching the heating element.
    *   If the smell persists, contact customer support. A specific guide on [why does my Cosori air fryer smell](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-cosori-air-fryer-smell) can provide more detailed solutions.

### Other Minor Issues

Most Cosori air fryer issues are easily resolved with basic troubleshooting. Regular cleaning and proper usage prevent many problems from occurring.
