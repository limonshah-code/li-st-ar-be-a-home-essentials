Reupholstering an ottoman with buttons involves removing old fabric, preparing the frame, cutting and attaching new fabric, then creating decorative tufts by pulling buttons through the upholstery with strong thread. This process gives a custom, refreshed appearance.

## Planning Your Ottoman Reupholstery Project

Starting any home improvement project requires good planning. Reupholstering an ottoman with buttons is no different. You need to think about design, materials, and the tools you will use. A clear plan makes the job easier and more fun. This initial stage sets the foundation for a successful outcome.

First, consider the style you want. Do you prefer a modern look, or something more traditional? The fabric choice is key to achieving your desired aesthetic. Think about the color and pattern. Then, consider the texture and durability of the fabric. I always imagine the finished piece in my living room before I buy anything.

### Choosing the Right Fabric

Selecting the correct fabric is vital for your project. The fabric must be durable and suitable for upholstery. Heavy-duty fabrics like velvet, linen blends, or even faux leather work well. These materials can withstand the tension of button tufting. They also stand up to daily use.

Avoid fabrics that are too thin or stretch too easily. They may tear when you pull the buttons. They also might not hold the tufts well over time. Always get a little extra fabric. This allows for mistakes or pattern matching. If you are reupholstering a storage ottoman, think about how the fabric will affect its functionality.

### Design Considerations and Button Selection

The design of your button tufting impacts the ottoman's final look. Decide on the button pattern: a diamond grid, a square grid, or something more random. Measure your ottoman to determine how many buttons you will need. This helps you space them evenly later.

Choose buttons that match your fabric and design. Upholstery buttons often have a shank back. You can also buy button-making kits to cover buttons with your chosen fabric. This creates a cohesive and professional finish. The size of the button also matters; larger buttons make a bolder statement.

### Gathering Your Workspace and Tools

A tidy workspace helps keep your project organized. Clear a large area where you can spread out your fabric and tools. Good lighting is also very helpful. Make sure your space is safe and free from hazards.

Gather all your tools before you begin. This saves time and frustration. You will need a staple gun, fabric scissors, and a long upholstery needle. Other items like a drill, a measuring tape, and strong thread are also essential. Having everything ready makes the process flow smoothly. If you are making a round ottoman, the planning might involve slightly different fabric cuts.

## Essential Tools and Materials for Button Tufting

Having the right tools makes any DIY project simpler and more effective. For button tufting, specific items are crucial. Using appropriate materials ensures a long-lasting and attractive finish. I always make a checklist before I start. This prevents mid-project runs to the store.

Investing in quality tools pays off. They work better and last longer. You do not want a staple gun jamming or a needle breaking in the middle of a delicate step. This section outlines the essential tools and materials.

### Must-Have Upholstery Tools

A heavy-duty staple gun is at the top of the list. Electric staple guns are often easier on your hands than manual ones. Make sure you have plenty of staples in the correct size. These will secure your new fabric firmly to the ottoman frame.

Next, you need sharp fabric scissors. Dull scissors can fray fabric and make uneven cuts. A long, sturdy upholstery needle is essential for button tufting. Look for one that is at least 6-12 inches long. A drill with a small bit is also useful for creating button holes if your ottoman's base is solid wood.

### Fabric and Foam Essentials

The new upholstery fabric is the star of the show. As mentioned, choose a durable, non-stretchy material. You will also need upholstery batting or Dacron. This material adds a soft layer over the foam. It helps the fabric glide smoothly.

You might need new foam for the top of your ottoman. High-density foam provides the best support and lasts a long time. Measure your ottoman carefully to get the correct foam size. If your ottoman is a regular one, but you are interested in making it a storage ottoman, you can learn more about how to turn a regular ottoman into a storage ottoman.

### Button Tufting Specifics

For the button tufting, you need a good supply of buttons. You can buy pre-made upholstery buttons or make your own. If making your own, you will need a button covering kit and scraps of your chosen fabric. Strong upholstery thread is also vital. Do not use regular sewing thread; it will break.

A special tool called a "button pulling needle" or "tufting needle" can make the job easier. It has a curved end or a special eye for threading. You will also need wax or silicone spray for the needle. This helps it pass through the foam and fabric smoothly. For attaching the buttons, a strong anchor, like a regular button or a small piece of fabric, is needed on the underside.

### Other Useful Items

A measuring tape and a fabric marker are necessary for marking your button positions accurately. Pliers can help pull staples. A seam ripper is useful for removing old fabric without damaging the frame. Safety glasses are a good idea when working with staple guns.

Finally, keep a vacuum cleaner nearby. It helps clean up dust and fabric scraps. A clean workspace is a happy workspace. With these tools and materials, you are ready to tackle your reupholstery project.

## Disassembling Your Ottoman (Carefully)

The first real step in reupholstering is taking the old ottoman apart. This part might seem simple, but it needs care. You want to preserve the frame and any reusable parts. I always take my time with this stage. It helps me understand how the ottoman was put together.

This process gives you a chance to inspect the ottoman's inner structure. You can check for any damage or weaknesses. Think of it as preparing a canvas before painting. A good foundation leads to a beautiful finish.

### Removing the Old Fabric

Start by turning the ottoman upside down. Look for staples or tacks holding the fabric to the base. Use a flathead screwdriver or a staple remover to pry them out. Be careful not to scratch the wood. Work slowly around the edges.

Peel back the old fabric layer by layer. Some ottomans have multiple layers of fabric, foam, and batting. Keep these layers organized as you remove them. They will serve as templates for your new materials. If your ottoman has legs, you may want to remove them for easier access.

### Inspecting the Frame

Once the fabric is off, you can see the bare frame. This is a good time to check its condition. Look for loose joints, cracks, or wobbly areas. A sturdy frame is essential for a long-lasting reupholstery job.

If you find loose joints, use wood glue and clamps to secure them. For cracks, wood filler can work. Let any repairs dry completely before moving on. A strong frame supports the new fabric and buttons better. Think about how you would inspect an antique sofa before reupholstering it. The same careful attention applies here. [You can learn about how to reupholster an antique sofa if you're interested](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reupholster-an-antique-sofa).

### Documenting the Process

I find it helpful to take photos or videos as I disassemble the ottoman. This visual record helps when you put the new fabric on. It shows you how corners were folded or how the fabric wrapped around curves. It is like having a secret instruction manual.

Label the old fabric pieces. For example, mark "top," "side A," "side B," etc. This ensures you cut your new fabric to the correct dimensions for each section. These old pieces will be your patterns. This step is especially important if your ottoman has unusual shapes.

### Reusing or Replacing Padding

Examine the old foam and batting. If they are still firm, clean, and in good shape, you might reuse them. Often, however, they are compressed, stained, or simply old. In most cases, replacing the foam and batting gives a much better result.

Even if you reuse the old foam, adding a fresh layer of batting on top makes a big difference. It smooths out any imperfections. It also gives a softer feel. Taking these careful steps in disassembly prepares your ottoman for its transformation.

## Preparing the Ottoman Frame and Foam

After carefully taking your ottoman apart, it is time for the next crucial phase: preparing the frame and foam. This stage directly impacts the comfort and durability of your newly upholstered piece. A well-prepared foundation ensures your hard work results in a professional-looking and long-lasting ottoman. I always make sure these steps are done right. It prevents problems later on.

Neglecting frame repairs or using old, flattened foam will compromise the final product. Your ottoman deserves a fresh start from the inside out. This section will guide you through getting the core structure ready.

### Repairing and Reinforcing the Frame

Take another good look at the ottoman frame. Even if you made initial repairs, a second check is wise. Tighten any loose screws. Use wood glue on any wobbly joints and clamp them until dry. If there are sharp edges or splinters, sand them down. This protects your new fabric from tearing.

Reinforce any weak areas with corner braces or additional wood blocks. A strong frame is essential, especially when you apply tension with the new fabric and tufting. A sturdy frame will support the weight and movement the ottoman will experience. This ensures the ottoman remains stable for years.

### Adding New Foam and Batting

New foam makes a huge difference in comfort and appearance. Measure the top of your ottoman and cut the new high-density foam to size. It should fit snugly. You can use spray adhesive to attach the foam to the frame, ensuring it does not shift.

Next, cover the foam with a layer of upholstery batting or Dacron. This batting creates a smooth dome shape. It also prevents the fabric from rubbing directly against the foam. It adds a plush feel and helps the fabric drape nicely. Cut the batting so it extends a few inches beyond the foam on all sides. Secure it temporarily with a few staples on the underside. This helps you choose an ottoman for the right size and comfort. [Consider how to choose an ottoman that fits your needs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-choose-an-ottoman).

### Marking Button Locations

This is a critical step for successful button tufting. Decide on your button pattern (e.g., a diamond grid). Use a measuring tape and fabric marker to mark the exact locations for each button on your foam and batting. For a diamond pattern, start by marking the center point. Then measure out from there.

Ensure the marks are evenly spaced. Use a straightedge to connect the marks, creating a grid. This visual guide will help you keep the tufts consistent. Precision here leads to a professional finish. I cannot stress enough how important this marking step is.

### Drilling Tufting Holes (If Necessary)

If your ottoman has a solid wood base, you will need to drill holes at each marked button location. Use a drill bit slightly larger than your upholstery needle. Drill all the way through the foam, batting, and the base of the ottoman. These holes provide a clear path for your tufting needle and thread.

If your ottoman has a webbing or spring base, you might not need to drill holes. The needle can pass through these materials directly. However, drilling ensures a perfectly straight path for each button, making the tufting process easier. Proper preparation at this stage makes the rest of the project much smoother.

## Cutting and Attaching New Fabric

With the frame and foam ready, it's time for the exciting part: bringing in the new fabric. This step transforms the ottoman visually. Precise cutting and careful attachment are key to a smooth, wrinkle-free finish. I always enjoy seeing the new fabric come to life. It signals that the project is truly moving forward.

This phase requires attention to detail. Every cut and every staple matters. Take your time to get it right. You want the fabric to look crisp and professional.

### Creating Fabric Patterns

Use the old fabric pieces you removed as templates for your new fabric. Lay them flat on your new fabric. Make sure to align any patterns or textures correctly. Pin the old fabric pieces to the new material. Then, carefully cut around them, adding a few extra inches for a seam allowance. This allowance gives you room to staple.

If your ottoman has a unique shape, consider making a paper pattern first. This helps you visualize the cuts before you commit to the fabric. Double-check all measurements before cutting. Remember the saying: "measure twice, cut once." This is very true in upholstery.

### Attaching the Top Fabric Piece

Center the main fabric piece over the top of your ottoman. Make sure any patterns are straight and aligned. Begin by stapling the fabric on one side, working from the center outwards. Pull the fabric taut but not too tight. Then, move to the opposite side and repeat. You want even tension across the top.

Next, staple the remaining two sides, again working from the center out. This "cross" method helps distribute tension evenly. Leave the corners free for now. They require special folding. Ensure no wrinkles appear on the top surface. Smooth any bubbles as you go.

### Handling Corners and Curves

Corners can be tricky. For square corners, you will likely fold the fabric like a present. Pull the fabric tightly around the corner. Create neat pleats or folds. Staple these folds securely to the underside of the frame. The goal is a clean, tailored corner.

For rounded corners or curves, make small relief cuts into the fabric. These cuts allow the fabric to fan out and lie flat around the curve. Then, pull and staple the fabric, making sure it follows the contour smoothly. Work slowly, adding staples as needed to hold the shape.

### Securing Side Panels and Bottom Fabric

If your ottoman has separate side panels, attach them in the same way. Start from the center of each side. Pull the fabric taut and staple it. Overlap the fabric neatly at the corners. For the bottom of the ottoman, you will typically use a thin black fabric called "cambric." This fabric covers the raw edges and staples.

Staple the cambric fabric to the bottom of the ottoman. This gives it a clean, finished look. Trim any excess fabric neatly. All raw edges should be hidden. This attention to detail makes your reupholstered ottoman look professionally done. You might also want to think about how this process compares to reupholstering other furniture, like a recliner.

## The Art of Button Tufting

Now comes the most distinctive part of reupholstering an ottoman with buttons: the tufting itself. This step creates those beautiful depressions that give a tufted look. It can seem daunting, but with patience and precision, you can achieve stunning results. I always find this part very satisfying. It's where the ottoman truly comes to life.

Button tufting adds a touch of elegance and sophistication. It makes your ottoman stand out. Getting the technique right ensures deep, even tufts. This section will guide you through making those perfect dimples.

### Preparing Your Buttons and Thread

First, make sure all your buttons are ready. If you are covering your own buttons, do that now. Thread your long upholstery needle with strong upholstery thread. Cut a generous length, at least three times the thickness of your ottoman. Double the thread for extra strength.

Tie a sturdy knot at one end of the doubled thread. This knot will secure the first button. You can also use a small regular button or a piece of leather as an anchor on the underside. This spreads the tension and prevents the thread from pulling through.

### Creating the Tuft

Start with a button at a marked location. Push the long upholstery needle through the center of the button. Then, guide the needle down through the marked hole on the top of the ottoman. Push it all the way through the foam, batting, and the drilled hole in the base. It should emerge on the underside.

Pull the thread firmly. This will draw the button down into the ottoman, creating the desired tuft. The depth of the tuft is up to your preference. Hold the tension on the thread. On the underside, attach another anchor (a second button or a small piece of fabric) to the thread.

### Securing the Buttons

With the thread held taut, wrap the thread around the anchor on the underside several times. Then, tie a very strong knot. You can use a square knot or a surgeon's knot for extra security. Cut the excess thread. Repeat this process for all your marked button locations.

As you work, periodically step back and check your progress. Ensure the tufts are evenly spaced and have consistent depth. If a tuft seems too loose, you can often re-tie the knot on the underside. Consistency is key for a professional look.

### Achieving Even Tufting

Even tufting requires careful attention to detail. Use a ruler to double-check the spacing between your buttons as you work. If you notice a tuft is not deep enough, you might need to pull the thread tighter before securing it. If it is too deep, you might need to loosen it slightly.

Sometimes, you might need to adjust the foam or batting around a button. This helps the fabric fall into a nice pleat. The goal is a uniform appearance across the entire top surface of the ottoman. Think about how a rocking chair might use tufting; the principles are similar.

### The Final Look of the Tufting

Once all buttons are in place, the tufting should look consistent. The fabric should create soft folds around each button. This creates the classic diamond or square pattern. This is a moment of pride for any DIY upholsterer. Your ottoman now has character and style. This meticulous process adds unique charm to your furniture.

## Finishing Touches and Base Attachment

You have successfully reupholstered and tufted your ottoman! Now, it is time for the final details that elevate your project from good to professional. These finishing touches ensure durability and a polished appearance. I find these last steps just as important as the first ones. They complete the transformation.

This stage involves trimming excess fabric, adding any decorative cording, and reattaching the base or legs. Each step contributes to the overall quality and aesthetic of your newly updated ottoman.

### Trimming Excess Fabric and Staple Lines

With all the fabric securely stapled and buttons tufted, you likely have excess fabric on the underside. Use sharp scissors to carefully trim this excess. Cut close to the staple lines but do not cut into them. A clean, neat edge prevents fraying.

The goal is to remove bulk and create a tidy appearance on the bottom. Even though this part is often not visible, a well-finished underside reflects quality craftsmanship. It also makes it easier to attach any bottom fabric or legs.

### Adding Decorative Cording or Trim

Many upholstered pieces feature decorative cording or gimp trim. This trim covers staple lines and adds a refined edge. If you choose to add cording, measure the perimeter of your ottoman. Cut the cording to size.

Apply the cording with hot glue or small upholstery tacks. Start at an inconspicuous spot, like the back or side. Work your way around, pressing the cording firmly into place. Ensure it lies flat and covers all raw edges. This small detail can make a big difference in the finished look.

### Reattaching Legs or Base

If you removed the legs or base at the beginning, it is now time to reattach them. Carefully align each leg with its original position. Use the screws or hardware you removed earlier. Tighten them securely. Ensure the ottoman sits level on the floor.

If your ottoman has a full base or plinth, reattach it using its original fasteners. Double-check that everything is stable and strong. The ottoman should not wobble. A firm base is crucial for safety and longevity.

### Attaching the Dust Cover (Cambric)

The final step for the underside is often to attach a dust cover, also known as cambric fabric. This thin, black fabric covers all the staples, raw edges, and the underside of the tufting. It gives a very clean, professional finish.

Cut the cambric to fit the bottom of your ottoman, leaving a small overlap. Fold under the edges for a clean hem. Then, staple it to the bottom of the ottoman frame. Use staples spaced about 2-3 inches apart. This cover protects the inside of your ottoman and hides any untidy bits.

### Final Inspection and Care

Give your newly reupholstered ottoman a thorough final inspection. Check all seams, tufts, and corners. Make sure everything is tight and looks good. Wipe away any dust or stray threads. Your beautiful, custom-made ottoman is now complete.

For ongoing care, regularly vacuum your ottoman. Spot clean any spills immediately according to your fabric's care instructions. With proper care, your newly reupholstered ottoman with buttons will be a cherished piece in your home for many years. It is a piece that you created yourself.

## Common Reupholstery Questions

Reupholstering furniture, especially with details like button tufting, can raise many questions. It's a hands-on project that involves various techniques. People often wonder about fabric choices, time commitment, and how to handle potential issues. I know I did when I first started. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions.

Knowing the answers beforehand can save you time and stress. It helps you prepare better for the project. These insights aim to make your reupholstery journey smoother and more enjoyable.

### Can I reupholster any ottoman with buttons?

Yes, most ottomans can be reupholstered with buttons. The best candidates are those with a solid top that can support the tufting. Ottomans with a wood or sturdy particleboard top are ideal. Ottomans with spring bases may require more internal support. The key is having a firm surface to pull the buttons into.

### What kind of fabric works best for tufting?

Durable, non-stretch fabrics are best
