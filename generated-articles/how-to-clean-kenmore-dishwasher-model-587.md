## Clean Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587: A Step-by-Step Guide

My dishwasher works hard. It cleans countless plates, glasses, and utensils every week. But even your trusty Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 needs a little TLC to perform at its best. Over time, food particles, grease, and hard water minerals build up inside. This buildup causes bad smells and leaves spots on your dishes. It also makes your dishwasher less efficient. If you notice cloudy glasses or a musty smell, it is time for a thorough cleaning.

This guide helps you refresh your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587. We will cover the specific areas that collect dirt and grime. You will learn about the right tools and natural cleaning agents. I will walk you through deep cleaning the filter, spray arms, and the entire interior. You will also discover simple maintenance tips. Keeping your dishwasher clean saves energy and extends its life. Let's make your Kenmore Model 587 work like new again.

### Takeaway

*   Regularly clean your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 to prevent odors and ensure sparkling dishes.
*   Focus cleaning efforts on the filter, spray arms, and door gasket.
*   Use natural cleaners like white vinegar and baking soda for effective deep cleaning cycles.
*   Perform monthly deep cleans and regular spot cleaning for optimal performance.
*   Always disconnect power before cleaning internal components for safety.

To effectively clean your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587, first unplug the appliance for safety. Next, remove and thoroughly clean the filter and spray arms. Then, wipe down the interior and door seal. Finally, run a hot cycle with white vinegar to eliminate odors and mineral deposits, ensuring sparkling dishes.

### Understanding Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587's Anatomy for Cleaning

Before you begin cleaning your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587, it helps to know its key parts. Each component plays a specific role in cleaning dishes. Each also collects different types of grime. Understanding these parts makes your cleaning effort more effective. You can target problem areas with precision.

The most important component is the filter. This part catches food scraps and debris. It stops these particles from recirculating onto your dishes. Many people forget to clean the filter. A clogged filter causes odors and leaves food bits on clean dishes. My Kenmore Model 587 has a removable filter, making cleaning easy.

Next, you have the spray arms. Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 typically has two, an upper and a lower. Water sprays through small holes in these arms. This water washes dishes clean. Food particles or mineral deposits can clog these holes. When holes clog, water cannot spray correctly. This results in poorly cleaned dishes.

The door gasket is another key area. This rubber seal runs around the dishwasher door. It prevents water from leaking out. Food, grease, and mold often build up here. A dirty gasket smells bad. It also compromises the seal. The detergent dispenser and rinse aid dispenser also need attention. Residue from detergents can build up here. This affects how much soap dispenses into the wash cycle. Knowing these parts helps you tackle dirt effectively.

### Essential Tools and Cleaning Agents for Your Model 587

Getting the right tools ready makes the cleaning process smooth. You do not need many specialized items to clean your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587. Most items are common household products. Having them all prepared saves time. It ensures you can complete each step without interruption. Safety is also important. Always remember to unplug your dishwasher before working on internal parts. This prevents accidental starts.

First, you need protective gloves. Dishwashers can harbor bacteria. Gloves protect your hands from grime and cleaning agents. Next, gather a few old cloths or sponges. Microfiber cloths work well for wiping down surfaces. They absorb grime effectively. A small brush, like an old toothbrush or a bottle brush, is essential. It helps scrub tight spaces and clear small holes. I always keep an old toothbrush specifically for appliance cleaning tasks.

For cleaning agents, white vinegar is your best friend. It is a natural acid. Vinegar dissolves mineral deposits and grease. It also acts as a deodorizer. Baking soda is another powerful natural cleaner. It neutralizes odors and gently scrubs away grime. Together, vinegar and baking soda create a powerful cleaning duo. You might also need a little dish soap. This helps clean the filter and other greasy parts. Some people prefer commercial dishwasher cleaners. These products are designed to break down tough buildup. However, for a Kenmore Model 587, vinegar and baking soda often do the trick very well. I find these natural options safe and effective for regular use.

### Deep Cleaning the Filter of Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587

Cleaning the filter is arguably the most crucial step for a fresh and efficient dishwasher. A clogged filter directly impacts how clean your dishes get. It also creates unpleasant odors. Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587, like many modern dishwashers, likely has a self-cleaning or manual-clean filter system. Mine has a manual-clean type. It is easy to remove and clean. I always start here when my dishes come out with residue or when I notice a funky smell. This is the first line of defense against food particles.

Here is how to deep clean the filter in your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587:

1.  **Unplug the Dishwasher:** Safety first. Always disconnect power to the appliance before reaching inside. I go to my breaker box and flip the switch labeled "Dishwasher."
2.  **Locate the Filter:** The filter is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is often near the base of the lower spray arm. It looks like a cylindrical mesh screen or a flat filter plate.
3.  **Remove the Filter:** My Kenmore Model 587's filter twists counter-clockwise to unlock. Then I lift it straight up. Some models may have latches or require a slight pull. Consult your owner's manual if you are unsure.
4.  **Rinse Under Running Water:** Take the filter to your sink. Rinse it under hot running water. You will see accumulated food bits and grease washing away.
5.  **Scrub with Soap and Brush:** For stubborn grime, use a small brush (like an old toothbrush) and a little dish soap. Gently scrub the mesh screen and any plastic components. Pay attention to all crevices. I scrub until all visible debris is gone.
6.  **Check for Odors:** If the filter still smells, soak it in a solution of warm water and white vinegar for 10-15 minutes. This helps neutralize any lingering odors.
7.  **Reinstall the Filter:** Once clean, place the filter back into its housing. Twist it clockwise or secure any latches until it clicks into place. Make sure it is fully seated to prevent debris from bypassing it.

Regular cleaning of your Kenmore dishwasher filter improves washing performance. It also prevents costly repairs down the road. I aim to clean my filter once a month. This keeps my Model 587 running smoothly.

### Cleaning the Spray Arms and Interior of Your Model 587

After tackling the filter, your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587's spray arms are the next priority. These arms deliver the water that cleans your dishes. If their tiny holes get clogged, water pressure drops. Dishes on certain racks may not get clean. I have seen this issue many times. Dishes on the top rack might be spotless, while those on the bottom are still gritty. This usually points to clogged spray arm nozzles. Cleaning them is a straightforward process.

Here is how to clean the spray arms:

1.  **Remove Spray Arms:** My Kenmore Model 587's lower spray arm lifts straight off its central post. The upper spray arm usually unscrews or unclips from the rack or water supply tube. Carefully remove both arms.
2.  **Clear Clogged Nozzles:** Hold each spray arm under running water. Use a toothpick, a small wire, or a straightened paper clip to poke through each individual nozzle hole. This dislodges any trapped food particles or mineral deposits. I sometimes hold it up to a light to make sure I can see through every hole.
3.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** After clearing the holes, rinse the spray arms completely. Ensure no debris remains inside.
4.  **Reinstall Spray Arms:** Place the upper and lower spray arms back into position. Make sure they spin freely without obstruction. A loose spray arm will not distribute water correctly.

Now, let us move to the interior of your Kenmore Model 587. The inner walls, door, and gasket also collect grime.

*   **Door Gasket:** This rubber seal is a magnet for food debris and mold. Mix a solution of warm water and a small amount of dish soap. Dampen a cloth or sponge with this solution. Carefully wipe down the entire length of the door gasket. Pay extra attention to the folds and crevices. An old toothbrush can help here. I often find a surprising amount of gunk hiding in this area.
*   **Interior Walls and Racks:** Use a damp cloth to wipe down the inside walls of the dishwasher. Remove any visible food splatters or residue. You can also wipe down the dish racks. While cleaning, check the wheels on your racks. Make sure they roll smoothly. If they are gunked up, a quick wipe down helps.
*   **Detergent and Rinse Aid Dispensers:** These can accumulate detergent residue or mineral deposits. Use a damp cloth to wipe them clean. If the dispenser flap sticks, a little warm water and gentle scrubbing usually frees it. Ensure the rinse aid dispenser is full for optimal drying results.

Cleaning these areas helps eliminate odors. It also ensures proper operation. The interior of your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 will look much cleaner. The next step takes care of hidden grime and mineral buildup.

### Tackling Odors and Limescale with a Deep Cleaning Cycle

Even after manually cleaning the filter, spray arms, and interior, microscopic particles and mineral deposits remain. These invisible culprits cause lingering odors and dull spots on dishes. A deep cleaning cycle using natural ingredients effectively addresses these issues. Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 benefits greatly from this process. I run this cycle at least once a month, sometimes more if my dishwasher works extra hard.

Here is how to conduct a deep cleaning cycle:

1.  **First Cycle: White Vinegar Power:**
    *   Ensure the dishwasher is empty. Do not put any dishes inside.
    *   Place a dishwasher-safe bowl or cup filled with two cups of white vinegar on the top rack.
    *   Do not add any detergent.
    *   Close the dishwasher door. Select the hottest wash cycle available. If your Kenmore Model 587 has a "Sanitize" or "Heavy Duty" option, use that.
    *   Start the cycle. The hot water and vinegar combine to dissolve grease, food residue, and mineral buildup. Vinegar is excellent for cutting through hard water spots and limescale. It also acts as a natural deodorizer. The vinegar circulates throughout the entire system. It reaches areas you cannot access manually.

2.  **Second Cycle: Baking Soda for Freshness:**
    *   Once the vinegar cycle finishes, sprinkle one cup of baking soda across the bottom of the empty dishwasher tub.
    *   Again, do not add any detergent.
    *   Select a short, hot wash cycle. A "Rinse Only" cycle or a quick wash works well.
    *   Start the cycle. Baking soda neutralizes any remaining odors. It also brightens the interior of your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587. It acts as a mild abrasive to scrub away any loose particles.

The combination of vinegar and baking soda effectively cleans and deodorizes. It leaves your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 smelling fresh. It also helps improve its cleaning performance significantly. This deep cleaning cycle is a powerful way to maintain your appliance. It also helps prevent future buildup. Remember that your dishwasher uses water for these cycles.

### Maintaining Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 for Longevity

Cleaning your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 once is great, but ongoing maintenance is key. Regular habits prevent grime from building up in the first place. This saves you time and effort in the long run. It also ensures your dishwasher always runs at peak efficiency. I have found that a few simple steps make a huge difference. These practices extend the life of your appliance. They also keep your dishes sparkling clean with less frequent deep cleans.

First, **pre-scrape your dishes**. You do not need to pre-rinse every dish. Simply scrape off large food particles before loading them. This prevents big pieces from clogging the filter. It also reduces the amount of food debris circulating in the wash water. Smaller food particles are easier for the dishwasher to handle. My Kenmore Model 587 handles small scraps well, but large ones cause issues.

Second, **use the correct detergent and rinse aid**. Always use dishwasher-specific detergent. Standard dish soap creates too many suds and can damage your machine. Rinse aid is often overlooked. It helps water sheet off dishes and prevents water spots. It also helps with drying. This is especially important if you have hard water. Check your Kenmore Model 587's rinse aid dispenser regularly. Refill it when needed.

Third, **avoid overloading**. While it is tempting to pack in as many dishes as possible, do not overcrowd your dishwasher. Overloading blocks spray arms. It also prevents water and detergent from reaching all surfaces. Leave enough space for water to circulate freely. Proper loading ensures every dish gets cleaned.

Fourth, **clean the exterior regularly**. Wipe down the control panel and door exterior. Use a damp cloth and mild cleaner. This prevents grease and fingerprints from building up. It keeps your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 looking good in your kitchen.

Finally, **address issues promptly**. If you hear strange noises, notice new leaks, or see performance drops, investigate. Sometimes a quick check can reveal a minor issue before it becomes a major problem. Keeping up with these small maintenance tasks ensures your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 serves you well for many years.

### Safety Precautions and When to Call a Professional

Cleaning your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 is a safe process when you follow basic precautions. However, knowing when to call in an expert is also crucial. Sometimes, a problem goes beyond simple cleaning. Understanding these boundaries ensures your safety and the longevity of your appliance. I always prioritize safety.

**Safety Precautions During Cleaning:**

1.  **Always Disconnect Power:** This is the most important step. Before you put your hands inside the dishwasher or work on any components, unplug the appliance from the wall outlet. If the cord is not accessible, trip the circuit breaker that supplies power to the dishwasher. This prevents accidental starts and electric shock. I make sure to verify the power is off before touching anything inside.
2.  **Wear Gloves:** As mentioned before, gloves protect your hands from grime, bacteria, and cleaning agents. Some cleaning solutions, even natural ones like vinegar, can irritate skin.
3.  **Use Proper Ventilation:** When using strong cleaners or even just vinegar, ensure your kitchen is well-ventilated. Open a window or turn on an exhaust fan. This dissipates any fumes.
4.  **Avoid Abrasive Materials:** Do not use steel wool, abrasive scrubbers, or harsh chemical cleaners inside your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587. These can scratch or damage the interior finish and plastic components. Stick to soft cloths and brushes.
5.  **Do Not Mix Chemicals:** Never mix different cleaning agents, especially bleach with ammonia or vinegar. This can create dangerous fumes. Stick to one type of cleaner per application. For instance, do not use bleach after a vinegar cycle without thoroughly rinsing the machine.

**When to Call a Professional:**

While regular cleaning solves many common dishwasher issues, some problems require expert attention.

*   **Persistent Leaks:** If your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 continues to leak after you have checked the door gasket and confirmed proper loading, it could indicate a faulty pump, hose, or seal. These issues are best handled by a trained technician.
*   **Unusual Noises:** Grinding, squealing, or loud banging sounds often point to a mechanical issue. This could be a problem with the motor, pump, or wash arm assembly. Cleaning will not fix these.
*   **Electrical Problems:** If your dishwasher does not turn on, trips the breaker, or has flickering lights, there is an electrical fault. This is very dangerous to attempt fixing yourself.
*   **Poor Washing Performance After Cleaning:** If your dishes still come out dirty or spotted after a thorough cleaning, the issue might be with the water inlet valve, heating element, or dispenser. A professional can diagnose these component failures.
*   **Error Codes:** Many modern Kenmore dishwashers display error codes. These codes usually point to specific component malfunctions. While you can look up the code in your manual, the solution often requires professional repair.

Knowing when to clean and when to call a professional ensures your Kenmore Dishwasher Model 587 stays in top shape safely. Do not hesitate to seek help for complex problems.
