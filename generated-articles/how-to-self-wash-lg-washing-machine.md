## Achieve a Spotless LG Washer: Self-Washing Guide

There is nothing quite like the feeling of pulling fresh, clean laundry from your washing machine. However, the machine itself needs cleaning too. Your LG washing machine works hard to keep your clothes spotless. Over time, residue from detergent, fabric softener, and dirt from clothes can build up inside the drum and other components. This buildup can cause unpleasant odors and affect your machine's performance. Learning how to self wash LG washing machine units ensures your laundry always comes out smelling fresh. It also helps your appliance last longer. This guide will walk you through the simple steps to keep your LG washer in top condition, using both its built-in features and some helpful manual cleaning techniques.

### Takeaway

*   Regular self-washing prevents odors and maintains machine efficiency.
*   Utilize your LG washer's "Tub Clean" cycle consistently.
*   Always use a washing machine cleaner or bleach during the cleaning cycle.
*   Do not forget to manually clean the gasket, dispenser, and exterior.
*   A clean washer means cleaner, fresher laundry for you.

To self-wash an LG washing machine, use its dedicated "Tub Clean" cycle. Add a washing machine cleaner or bleach to the dispenser. Start the cycle without clothes. This cycle removes detergent residue and odors, keeping your washer fresh.

### Understanding Your LG Washing Machine's Self-Wash Feature

LG washing machines come with a fantastic feature called "Tub Clean." This cycle is specifically for cleaning the inside of the wash drum. It targets mold, mildew, and detergent residue that build up over time. Using this feature regularly is important. It helps maintain a healthy washing environment for your clothes.

The Tub Clean cycle uses high water levels and fast spinning. This action thoroughly rinses the drum. It flushes out any hidden gunk. This function is vital for front-load and top-load LG washers. Front-load machines are prone to mold growth around the door gasket. Regular cleaning stops this. Top-load machines can also collect residue in hidden areas. The Tub Clean cycle reaches these spots. It helps remove things you cannot see. This ensures your machine stays hygienic.

Many people think their washing machine cleans itself every time it washes clothes. This is not true. The Tub Clean cycle is different from a regular wash cycle. It uses different water temperatures and spin speeds. It focuses on cleaning the machine itself, not just rinsing out clothes. Using this feature improves your machine's performance. It also helps extend its life. Make sure to consult your LG washing machine's user manual. It will provide model-specific instructions for the Tub Clean cycle.

Ignoring the Tub Clean cycle can lead to problems. You might notice your clothes do not smell as fresh. They might even develop a musty odor. This is a sign that your machine needs attention. Regular use of the Tub Clean cycle prevents these issues. It keeps your laundry consistently clean and fresh.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using LG's Tub Clean Cycle

Using the Tub Clean cycle on your LG washing machine is straightforward. Following these steps ensures a thorough cleaning. First, make sure the washing machine drum is empty. Remove any clothes or items from the washer. This cycle cleans the machine only.

Next, decide on your cleaning agent. You can use a commercial washing machine cleaner. Many brands sell specific tablets or liquids for this purpose. Alternatively, you can use bleach. Add one cup of liquid chlorine bleach to the detergent dispenser. Some LG models have a separate bleach dispenser. If using a commercial cleaner, follow its instructions for where to place it. Do not use detergent or fabric softener during this cycle. These products can add to the residue problem.

Now, select the Tub Clean cycle. On most LG models, you will find a dedicated button or option for "Tub Clean." It might also be labeled "Clean Washer" or "Sanitize." Press the power button first. Then, select the Tub Clean cycle. Once selected, press the "Start/Pause" button. The machine will fill with water and begin the cleaning process. This cycle can take a while. It often runs for over an hour. Do not interrupt the cycle once it starts. Let it complete its full process.

After the cycle finishes, wipe down the inside of the door and the rubber gasket with a clean cloth. Sometimes, residue can collect there. This final wipe ensures all areas are clean. Repeat this process every month or two. This keeps your LG washer fresh and ready for laundry.

### Beyond Tub Clean: Manual Cleaning for a Deeper Self-Wash

While the Tub Clean cycle is essential, it does not clean every part of your LG washing machine. Certain areas require manual attention. These spots include the detergent dispenser, the door gasket, and the exterior of the machine. Neglecting these areas can still lead to odors and mold growth.

The detergent dispenser often accumulates old detergent and fabric softener. This residue can become sticky and harbor bacteria. To clean it, remove the dispenser drawer if possible. Most LG models allow you to pull it out easily. Wash the drawer under warm running water. Use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away buildup. Make sure to clean all compartments. Rinse thoroughly and dry before putting it back. If the dispenser is not removable, wipe inside with a damp cloth. You can also use a vinegar solution.

The rubber gasket around the door of a front-load LG washer is a prime spot for mold and mildew. After each wash, wipe this area dry. For deeper cleaning, pull back the folds of the gasket. Use a spray bottle with a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar. Spray the entire gasket. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, wipe it clean with a cloth. Pay attention to any black spots, which are mold. For stubborn mold, you might need to scrub gently with a brush. Always dry the gasket completely afterward. Leaving the door ajar after a wash helps air circulation. This prevents moisture buildup and mold growth.

Remember the exterior too. Wipe down the control panel and the top of the machine. Use a soft, damp cloth and mild soap if needed. Avoid harsh chemicals on the control panel. These manual steps complement the Tub Clean cycle. They ensure your entire LG washing machine is truly clean.

### Tackling Stubborn Odors and Mold in Your LG Washer

Persistent odors and mold are common problems in washing machines. These issues often arise from moisture, detergent residue, and bio-film buildup. LG washers, like any other brand, can develop these issues if not properly maintained. Addressing them promptly is important for fresh laundry.

One major cause of odors is leaving wet clothes in the drum. This creates a damp, warm environment. It is perfect for mold and mildew to grow. Always remove clothes immediately after the cycle finishes. Another cause is using too much detergent or fabric softener. These products do not always rinse away completely. They leave residue that molds and smells. Use only the recommended amount of high-efficiency (HE) detergent. HE detergents are low-sudsing and formulated for modern washers.

To tackle existing odors, first run the Tub Clean cycle with a washing machine cleaner. If the smell persists, try a solution of white vinegar and baking soda. Add two cups of white vinegar to the detergent dispenser. Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda directly into the empty drum. Run the hottest possible cycle. Do not use the Tub Clean cycle with this mixture. A regular hot wash cycle is fine. The vinegar breaks down mineral deposits and mold. Baking soda absorbs odors. After this cycle, wipe down the drum and gasket again.

For visible mold on the gasket, a strong vinegar solution works well. Mix equal parts vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the moldy areas. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. Then, scrub with a brush or cloth. You can also use a small amount of bleach solution for tough mold spots. Ensure good ventilation when using bleach. Always dry the gasket thoroughly after cleaning. Consistent cleaning and airing out your machine are the best defenses against odors and mold.

### Essential Maintenance Tips for a Long-Lasting LG Washer

Keeping your LG washing machine in good shape involves more than just cleaning. A few simple maintenance habits can greatly extend its lifespan. These habits help prevent common issues and ensure efficient operation. Implementing these tips will keep your washer running smoothly for years.

First, always use the correct type of detergent. Modern LG washers are designed for high-efficiency (HE) detergent. HE detergents produce fewer suds. Too many suds can leave residue inside the machine. This residue can lead to odors and buildup. Using non-HE detergent can also cause your machine to use more water. It tries to rinse away the excess suds. This wastes water and energy. Always look for the "HE" symbol on your detergent packaging.

Second, avoid overloading your washing machine. Overloading stresses the motor and other components. It also prevents clothes from getting properly cleaned. An overloaded machine cannot spin freely. This means detergent and dirt might not rinse out completely. Check your LG washer's manual for its maximum load capacity. Leave enough space for clothes to tumble freely. A good rule is to fill the drum about three-quarters full.

Third, remember to clean the lint filter or pump filter regularly. Some LG models have accessible filters. These filters trap lint, coins, and other small items. A clogged filter can reduce draining efficiency. It can also cause vibrations or error codes. Consult your manual to locate and clean this filter. Cleaning it every few months prevents drainage problems. For issues with draining, you might find this article helpful: [How To Get LG Washing Machine To Drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-lg-washing-machine-to-drain).

Finally, after each wash, leave the washing machine door slightly ajar. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps evaporate any remaining moisture. This simple step is highly effective in preventing mold and mildew growth. It keeps the inside of your washer dry and fresh. Consistent application of these tips will contribute to a long and trouble-free life for your LG washing machine.

### Troubleshooting Common LG Washer Cleaning Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues with your LG washing machine. Sometimes, odors persist, or the machine seems to have problems. Knowing how to troubleshoot these common cleaning-related issues can save you time and frustration. Most problems have simple solutions.

If the "Tub Clean" cycle does not seem to remove all odors, consider the type of cleaner you are using. Some mild cleaners might not be strong enough for persistent issues. Try a dedicated washing machine cleaner designed for deep cleaning. Alternatively, use chlorine bleach if your machine allows it. Ensure you are using the correct amount. Running the cycle twice in a row can also help. After the first run, let the machine rest for an hour. Then, start the second cycle.

Visible black mold on the door gasket can be stubborn. If simply wiping it does not work, you might need a stronger approach. Create a paste with baking soda and a small amount of water. Apply this paste directly to the moldy areas. Let it sit for several hours or even overnight. Then, scrub with a brush and wipe clean. For severe mold, some users have success with a bleach-soaked towel. Lay a bleach-soaked towel directly on the mold. Leave it for 30 minutes. Then, remove the towel and wipe clean. Always ensure good ventilation when using bleach. Rinse the area thoroughly afterward.

If your LG washing machine is displaying error codes related to drainage or balance, it might be due to trapped items. Small items like coins or socks can get stuck in the drain pump. This prevents proper drainage. This can also cause a machine not to clean properly. Refer to your user manual for specific error code meanings. Often, the solution involves accessing and cleaning the drain pump filter. This filter is usually at the bottom front of the machine. For more about LG washing machine beeping or error codes, you can read: [Why Is My LG Washing Machine Beeping](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-washing-machine-beeping). Always unplug the machine before checking internal components.

Remember that consistent, preventative cleaning is the best strategy. Dealing with issues as they arise is crucial. A well-maintained LG washer performs better and lasts longer.

### FAQ Section

**Q1: How often should I self-wash my LG washing machine?**
You should self-wash your LG washing machine using the "Tub Clean" cycle about once a month. If you wash frequently, or if you use a lot of fabric softener, you might want to do it every three weeks. Consistent cleaning prevents odors and residue buildup.

**Q2: Can I use vinegar instead of a commercial cleaner for Tub Clean?**
Yes, you can use white vinegar. Add two cups of white vinegar to the liquid detergent dispenser for the Tub Clean cycle. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant and deodorizer. It helps break down hard water deposits and soap scum.

**Q3: What causes my LG washing machine to smell?**
Washing machines can smell due to moisture trapped in the drum. This creates a breeding ground for mold and mildew. Using too much detergent or fabric softener also leaves residue. This residue can break down and cause unpleasant odors over time.

**Q4: Is the Tub Clean cycle safe for all LG washer models?**
The Tub Clean cycle is safe for most modern LG washing machine models. It is a standard feature on many current washers. Always check your specific LG model's user manual. This confirms the availability and proper use of its self-clean or Tub Clean function.

**Q5: Does Tub Clean remove lint and pet hair?**
The Tub Clean cycle helps flush out loose lint and pet hair from the drum. However, it is not a direct lint removal process. For large amounts of lint or hair, manually wipe down the drum before starting the cycle. Some hair can also collect in the drain pump filter.
