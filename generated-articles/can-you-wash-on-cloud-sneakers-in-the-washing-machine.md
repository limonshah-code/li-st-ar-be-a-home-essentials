### Understanding On Cloud Sneakers: Materials and Construction

On Cloud sneakers are famous for their unique design. They use specific materials for performance and comfort. Knowing these materials helps us understand how to clean them. We need to protect these components during washing.

Most On Cloud shoes feature a CloudTec® sole. This sole uses individual "cloud" elements. These elements compress and rebound to cushion your stride. The material for these clouds is often Helion™ superfoam. This foam is lightweight but durable. It provides a soft landing and a powerful push-off.

The upper part of On Cloud sneakers uses various fabrics. Many models feature engineered mesh. This mesh offers breathability and a lightweight feel. Some models include synthetic overlays. These overlays provide support and structure. Other shoes might have ripstop fabric or even some waterproof membranes.

The interior of the shoe includes a sock liner and an insole. These parts add comfort and moisture-wicking properties. Laces are usually durable synthetic cords. All these components are important for the shoe's function. They also dictate the best cleaning methods.

Machine washing can be harsh on these specific materials. High heat can shrink or deform mesh uppers. Strong detergents can damage foam or adhesives. The tumbling action can stress seams and delicate overlays. This is why careful washing methods are so important for On Cloud shoes. We want to preserve their integrity and performance.

Protecting your On Cloud sneakers starts with understanding their build. These shoes are not like heavy canvas sneakers. Their lightweight nature and specialized foam require a gentle approach. Knowing this helps you make smart cleaning choices.

### The Verdict: Can On Cloud Sneakers Go In the Washing Machine?

Many On Cloud sneaker owners ask this question. The answer is yes, but with careful steps. You can machine wash most On Cloud sneakers. However, you must follow specific guidelines. Skipping these steps can damage your shoes.

On running shoes are built for performance. Their materials are strong but also sensitive to heat and harsh chemicals. The unique CloudTec soles can be affected by improper washing. This is why a gentle approach is always best. We aim to clean the shoes without harming their structure or function.

Some On Cloud models are more delicate than others. Shoes with leather details or intricate stitching may not do well in a machine. Always check the care label inside your shoes first. This label often gives manufacturer recommendations. If it says "hand wash only," then follow that advice.

For most standard mesh or fabric On Cloud models, machine washing is an option. It helps remove deep-seated dirt and odors. A washing machine can be more effective than hand washing for a thorough clean. The key is to use the right settings and protection. This ensures your sneakers come out clean and undamaged.

You risk several issues with improper machine washing. High heat can warp the sole's foam. It can also shrink or damage the upper mesh. A harsh wash cycle might pull apart seams or loosen adhesives. Strong detergents can strip away protective coatings or fade colors. My experience shows that a cold, gentle cycle is your best friend.

So, while you *can* wash On Cloud sneakers in a washing machine, it requires a cautious approach. Think of it as a delicate garment wash. Prioritize protection and gentle care. This approach will extend the life of your favorite shoes. Learning how to clean sneakers in a washing machine properly is a valuable skill.

### Preparing Your On Cloud Shoes for a Machine Wash

Before you put your On Cloud sneakers in the washing machine, you must prepare them. Proper preparation helps protect your shoes. It also makes the cleaning process more effective. This step is crucial for good results.

First, remove the laces from both shoes. Laces can get tangled during the wash cycle. They might also pull on the shoe's eyelets. You can wash the laces separately. Place them in a small mesh bag or even hand wash them. This ensures they get clean without causing issues.

Next, take out the insoles. Insoles are often made of different materials than the shoe body. They might absorb too much water. Machine washing can also wear them out faster. Many insoles clean best with a simple hand wash. You can scrub them gently with a brush and mild soap. Rinse them well and let them air dry completely.

Now, tackle any loose dirt or mud. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush. Scrape off excess mud from the soles and upper. You can also tap the shoes together. This helps dislodge small stones or debris. Removing major dirt prevents it from spreading inside the washing machine. It also makes the machine wash more effective. For deeper dirt removal, you can find more tips on [how to clean sneakers in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-sneakers-in-the-washing-machine).

Finally, put your On Cloud sneakers into a mesh laundry bag. This is a very important step. The mesh bag protects your shoes from tumbling too much. It prevents them from banging against the drum or other items. This reduces the risk of scuffs, tears, or damage to the shoe's structure. If you don't have a mesh bag, an old pillowcase tied shut can work. It offers similar protection. Always place one shoe per bag if possible, or two shoes gently in a larger bag. This keeps them from rubbing against each other.

By following these preparation steps, you set your On Cloud sneakers up for a successful machine wash. This careful approach helps keep your shoes in good condition.

### Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings for On Clouds

Selecting the correct washing machine settings is vital for cleaning On Cloud sneakers. Wrong settings can cause irreversible damage. We want to clean the shoes gently and effectively. This section guides you through the best choices for your machine.

Always use cold water for washing your On Cloud sneakers. Hot water is a major enemy of athletic shoes. It can melt or warp the adhesives that hold the shoe together. Hot water can also cause the mesh or fabric uppers to shrink. The CloudTec foam soles are also sensitive to high temperatures. Cold water cleans effectively without these risks. It helps preserve the shoe's shape and integrity.

Choose a gentle cycle or a delicate setting on your washing machine. These cycles use less agitation. They spin at a lower speed. This reduces the stress on your sneakers. A normal or heavy-duty cycle is too harsh. It can cause the shoes to bang around. This can lead to damage like ripped seams or detached soles. The gentle cycle mimics a softer hand wash. It cleans without excessive force.

For detergent, use a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid powdered detergents. They might not dissolve completely. This can leave residue on your shoes. Do not use bleach or any harsh chemicals. Bleach can cause discoloration. It can also weaken the fabric fibers. Harsh chemicals can strip protective coatings. They may also damage the foam and rubber parts. Look for detergents labeled "gentle" or "delicate." These are usually pH-neutral.

Some people add a few old towels to the wash. Place these towels with your shoes in the mesh bag. This provides extra cushioning. The towels absorb some of the impact during the wash cycle. This further protects your On Cloud sneakers. Ensure the towels are also clean. This prevents transferring dirt to your shoes. You can learn more about specific machine settings for different types of footwear at [how to wash sneakers in machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-sneakers-in-machine).

These settings create a safe environment for your sneakers. They ensure a thorough clean without risking damage. My experience has shown that these gentle settings work best.

### Best Practices for Drying On Cloud Sneakers After Washing

Drying your On Cloud sneakers properly is just as important as washing them. Incorrect drying methods can cause significant damage. Heat is the biggest enemy during the drying process. We want to dry the shoes completely but gently.

Air drying is the only recommended method for On Cloud sneakers. Never put your On Cloud shoes in a clothes dryer. The high heat from a dryer will deform the CloudTec soles. It can melt adhesives. It will also shrink the upper materials. The shoe's structure and fit will be ruined. Direct sunlight can also be too intense. It might fade colors or dry materials too quickly. This can lead to cracks.

To air dry your sneakers, find a cool, dry place. A shaded outdoor area or an indoor spot with good air circulation works best. You can hang the shoes by their tongues. Use clothes pegs or hooks. This allows air to circulate all around the shoe. Alternatively, place them on a drying rack. Make sure the rack allows air flow from below.

Stuffing your On Cloud sneakers with paper towels or old newspapers helps. The paper absorbs moisture from inside the shoe. It also helps the shoe keep its shape as it dries. Change the paper every few hours. Do this until it comes out mostly dry. This speeds up the internal drying process. Do not use colored newspaper. The ink can transfer to the shoe's fabric. Plain paper towels are the safest choice.

Drying time will vary. It depends on the humidity and temperature of your drying area. It also depends on how wet the shoes were. Generally, it can take 24 to 48 hours for On Cloud sneakers to dry completely. Do not rush the process. Make sure the shoes are bone dry before you wear them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to odors or mildew. Patience is key for proper drying.

Following these drying best practices ensures your On Cloud sneakers maintain their shape, fit, and performance. You have invested in these shoes. Giving them the right care after washing is a smart move.

### When Hand Washing is the Better Option for On Clouds

While machine washing is an option, sometimes hand washing is simply the better choice for your On Cloud sneakers. Certain situations call for a more delicate approach. Hand washing gives you more control. This reduces the risk of damage.

If your On Cloud sneakers have specific delicate features, hand washing is ideal. Shoes with leather accents, suede panels, or very intricate details should be hand-washed. Machine washing can scuff leather. It can also damage the texture of suede. If your shoes have sensitive embroidered logos or reflective elements, hand washing is safer. These details might not withstand the machine's agitation.

Hand washing is also best for targeted stain removal. If you have a small, stubborn stain, you don't need to wash the whole shoe. You can focus your cleaning efforts on that specific spot. This saves time and is gentler on the overall shoe material. For instance, a small mud splatter or a grass stain can be addressed directly. You can find general tips for targeted cleaning by referring to [how to clean your sneakers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-sneakers).

Here are the steps for hand washing your On Cloud sneakers:

1.  **Remove laces and insoles:** Just like machine washing, take these out first. Wash them separately by hand.
2.  **Pre-clean loose dirt:** Brush off any mud or loose debris. Use a dry brush or old toothbrush.
3.  **Prepare a cleaning solution:** Mix a small amount of mild liquid soap with warm water. Dish soap or gentle laundry detergent works well.
4.  **Wet the shoes:** Dampen a cloth or sponge with the cleaning solution.
5.  **Scrub gently:** Rub the shoes in circular motions. Focus on dirty areas. Use an old toothbrush for tough spots. Be gentle on mesh uppers.
6.  **Clean soles:** Use the brush and soap solution on the outsoles. Remove grime from the CloudTec elements.
7.  **Wipe clean:** Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away soap residue. Ensure all soap is gone.
8.  **Air dry:** Stuff the shoes with paper towels. Let them air dry in a cool, well-ventilated area.

For white fabric On Cloud sneakers, hand washing helps prevent overall dullness. It allows you to use specific white shoe cleaners if needed. This method gives you total control. It ensures your shoes get clean without harm. I often choose hand washing for my favorite pair. It ensures the best results.

### Maintaining Your On Cloud Sneakers Between Washes

Cleaning your On Cloud sneakers is not just about big wash days. Regular maintenance helps keep them fresh. It also extends the time between major cleanings. Small actions can make a big difference.

After each wear, take a moment to inspect your shoes. If you walked through mud or dirt, wipe them down immediately. A damp cloth can remove fresh dirt easily. This prevents stains from setting in. Dust and loose debris can be brushed off with a soft shoe brush. This quick habit keeps your shoes looking cleaner for longer. My personal routine includes a quick wipe-down after every outdoor run.

Store your On Cloud sneakers properly. Keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. These can degrade the shoe materials over time. If you have the original shoebox, use it. This protects them from dust. If not, a shoe rack in a closet works well. Ensure they have enough air circulation. Do not store them in damp environments. This can lead to mold or mildew growth.

Odor control is another important part of maintenance. Sweat and bacteria cause shoe odors. You can use shoe deodorizers or odor-absorbing inserts. Baking soda is also a natural odor absorber. Sprinkle a little inside the shoes overnight. Then shake it out in the morning. Cedar shoe trees also help absorb moisture and fight odors. They also help maintain the shoe's shape.

For specific stains, act quickly. The faster you treat a stain, the easier it is to remove. For oil-based stains, use a small amount of dish soap. For water-based stains, a gentle fabric cleaner can work. Always test any cleaning product on an inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not damage or discolor the material. I always keep a stain remover pen handy for quick fixes. You can find many general cleaning tips at [clean sneakers how to](https://homeessentialsguide.com/clean-sneakers-how-to).

Protecting your On Cloud sneakers from the elements is also key. Consider using a water and stain repellent spray. Apply this to the fabric uppers. It creates a barrier against moisture and dirt. Reapply it periodically, following the product instructions. This extra layer of protection keeps your shoes looking new. It also makes future cleaning easier. Regular care will keep your On Cloud sneakers in top condition.

### FAQ Section

#### Q1: Can I put On Cloud insoles in the washing machine?
No, it is best to avoid machine washing your On Cloud insoles. Insoles are often made from delicate foam or gel materials. The agitation of a washing machine can cause them to break down or lose their shape. This affects the comfort and support they offer. Instead, hand wash your insoles. Use a soft brush, mild soap, and cold water. Rinse them thoroughly and let them air dry completely before putting them back in your shoes.

#### Q2: How often should I wash my On Cloud sneakers?
The frequency depends on how often you wear them and what activities you do. For daily wear or light exercise, a full wash every 2-3 months is usually sufficient. If you use them for muddy trails or intense workouts, you might need to clean them more often. Regular spot cleaning between washes is very important. This helps keep them fresh and extends the time between deep cleans.

#### Q3: Will machine washing damage the CloudTec soles?
Machine washing, if done improperly, can damage the CloudTec soles. High heat from a hot water cycle or a dryer is the main culprit. It can warp or melt the foam elements. Using harsh detergents can also degrade the material over time. However, using cold water, a gentle cycle, and air drying significantly reduces this risk. The mesh bag also protects the soles from direct impact inside the machine.

#### Q4: What detergent is safe for On Cloud shoes?
Always use a mild, liquid laundry detergent. Look for detergents labeled "gentle" or "delicate." These detergents are typically pH-neutral and less aggressive. Avoid powdered detergents, as they may leave residue. Never use bleach or fabric softeners. Bleach can cause discoloration and weaken materials. Fabric softeners can leave a film and affect moisture-wicking properties. A small amount of gentle liquid detergent is all you need.

#### Q5: Can I dry my On Cloud sneakers in a dryer?
No, absolutely do not put your On Cloud sneakers in a dryer. The high heat from a clothes dryer is extremely damaging. It will cause the CloudTec foam soles to deform or melt. It can also shrink the fabric upper, warp adhesives, and ruin the shoe's overall structure and fit. Always air dry your On Cloud sneakers. Stuff them with paper towels to absorb moisture and maintain shape.

#### Q6: How do I remove stubborn stains from On Cloud shoes?
For stubborn stains, target them with a pre-treatment before washing. Apply a small amount of mild liquid detergent directly to the stain. Gently rub it with an old toothbrush. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. For white fabric, a paste of baking soda and a tiny bit of water can also work. Test any product on a hidden area first. Then proceed with either hand washing or the gentle machine wash method.

### Conclusion

Caring for your On Cloud sneakers ensures their longevity and performance. You can wash On Cloud sneakers in the washing machine. Remember to follow the right steps. Always use a cold water, gentle cycle with a mild detergent. Protect your shoes in a mesh laundry bag. This careful approach prevents damage to their unique materials.

After washing, always air dry your sneakers completely. Avoid using a dryer or exposing them to direct heat. This helps preserve the shape and integrity of the CloudTec soles and fabric uppers. For delicate models or specific stains, hand washing remains an excellent and safe alternative. Regular maintenance, including spot cleaning and proper storage, keeps your On Cloud shoes fresh between washes. By following these guidelines, your On Cloud sneakers will stay comfortable, supportive, and stylish for many miles to come. Give your shoes the care they deserve. They support you every step of the way.
