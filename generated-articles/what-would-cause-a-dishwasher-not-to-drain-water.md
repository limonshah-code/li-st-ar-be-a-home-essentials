## Troubleshooting Why Your Dishwasher Won't Drain Water

Discovering standing water in your dishwasher after a wash cycle is incredibly frustrating. This common problem indicates that your dishwasher is not draining water correctly. It prevents your dishes from being clean and presents hygiene concerns in your kitchen. I understand the annoyance this issue brings to daily household tasks.

This article explores the primary reasons a dishwasher won't drain water. We will discuss blockages in the filter, drain hose, and air gap. We will also examine issues with the drain pump and garbage disposal connection. You will learn simple troubleshooting steps for each problem. My goal is to help you diagnose and resolve these frustrating drainage issues.

### Takeaway

If your dishwasher is not draining water, check these common areas:

*   **Clean the Filter and Drain Screen:** Remove food debris and grease regularly.
*   **Inspect the Drain Hose:** Ensure it is free of kinks and clogs.
*   **Check the Air Gap/High Loop:** Confirm proper installation and clear obstructions.
*   **Examine the Drain Pump:** Listen for sounds; it might need clearing or replacement.
*   **Verify Garbage Disposal:** Ensure the knock-out plug is removed and the disposal is clear.
*   **Consider Main House Plumbing:** Rule out larger blockages if dishwasher specific checks fail.

When a dishwasher does not drain water, it typically points to a blockage in the filter, drain hose, air gap, or garbage disposal connection. A faulty drain pump or issues with your home's main plumbing can also prevent proper drainage. Identifying the specific cause allows for targeted repair.

### The Dishwasher Filter and Drain Screen: A Common Culprit

One of the most frequent reasons a dishwasher is not draining water comes down to a clogged filter or drain screen. These components catch food particles and debris during the wash cycle. Over time, these particles accumulate, blocking water flow. This blockage prevents water from exiting the wash tub effectively.

I often see significant build-up in filters that have not been cleaned regularly. When the filter becomes overloaded, water cannot pass through it to the drain pump. This results in standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher. Regular maintenance of these parts is crucial for proper operation.

Cleaning your dishwasher filter is a straightforward task. First, locate the filter, which usually sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It often involves twisting and lifting a cylindrical component. Once removed, rinse the filter under running water. Use a soft brush to scrub away any stuck-on food or grease. I recommend cleaning this filter at least once a month, more often if you wash dishes with heavy food residue. This simple step can prevent many drainage problems.

The drain screen, often flat and located near the filter, also needs attention. Food scraps and foreign objects can become trapped here. Inspect it for blockages and clear any debris you find. A clean filter and drain screen allow water to flow freely to the drain pump, preventing your dishwasher from holding standing water. You can learn more about how to keep this area clean by reading about [how to clean your dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain). It offers detailed steps to ensure thorough cleaning.

Ignoring a clogged filter leads to dirty dishes and bad odors. More importantly, it directly causes the dreaded "dishwasher not draining water" issue. Taking a few minutes to clean these parts saves you from bigger headaches. Ensure all filter components are securely reinstalled after cleaning. Proper reinstallation guarantees they continue catching debris effectively and allow water to exit. Regularly cleaning out your dishwasher drain is a vital maintenance step for any home.

### Obstructions in the Dishwasher Drain Hose

A significant cause of a dishwasher not draining water is an obstruction in the drain hose. This hose carries the dirty water from your dishwasher to the garbage disposal or a dedicated standpipe. Kinks, twists, or clogs within this hose will prevent water from flowing out. This causes water to remain in the dishwasher tub.

I have found that the drain hose can easily get crimped if the dishwasher is pushed back into place carelessly. A simple kink restricts water flow entirely. Food particles and grease can also accumulate inside the hose over time. This creates a blockage that water struggles to bypass. These clogs often happen where the hose connects to other plumbing.

To check the drain hose, you first need to pull your dishwasher out from under the counter. This provides access to the back of the unit. Visually inspect the entire length of the hose for any bends or kinks. Straighten any crimped sections you find. If the hose looks clear externally, the blockage might be internal.

You can disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink/disposal connection. Have a bucket ready to catch any residual water. Once disconnected, you can try to flush water through it. A plumber's snake or a straightened coat hanger can help dislodge internal clogs. Push the tool gently through the hose to clear any debris. Be careful not to puncture the hose material.

It is important to ensure the drain hose has a proper high loop or air gap installation. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. A high loop means the hose rises above the drain connection point before descending. This creates an air break. If your drain hose does not have this setup, it can lead to drainage problems. Sometimes, water might even sit in the hose. You might wonder, [should there be water in a dishwasher drain hose?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/should-there-be-water-in-dishwasher-drain-hose) Generally, a small amount of residual water is acceptable due to the high loop, but a full hose indicates an issue.

After checking and clearing the hose, reconnect it securely. Run a test cycle to ensure the dishwasher drains properly. If water still stands, the issue might lie elsewhere. Proper drain hose maintenance is critical for preventing a dishwasher not draining water.

### The Dishwasher's Drain Pump: Mechanical Failures and Clogs

When your dishwasher is not draining water, the drain pump is a prime suspect. The drain pump is a small motor that actively pushes water out of the dishwasher. If this pump fails or becomes obstructed, water cannot exit the machine. This leaves standing water in the tub.

I often hear users describe a humming sound coming from the dishwasher, but no water movement. This indicates the motor is running, but something prevents the impeller from spinning. A foreign object, like a broken piece of glass, a fruit sticker, or a small bone, can lodge in the pump's impeller. This prevents the pump from pushing water out. A completely silent pump suggests an electrical failure or a broken motor.

Accessing the drain pump requires disassembling parts of your dishwasher. Always disconnect power to the appliance before starting. You typically find the pump at the bottom of the dishwasher, often beneath the spray arms and filter assembly. Some models allow access from inside the tub, while others require pulling the dishwasher out and accessing it from underneath. Consult your owner's manual for specific instructions.

Once you gain access, inspect the impeller for any visible obstructions. Carefully remove any debris you find. Small objects can cause significant issues. If the pump appears clear but still does not work, it might have a mechanical or electrical fault. You can use a multimeter to test the pump's motor for continuity. If there is no continuity, the motor is likely bad.

Replacing a drain pump can be a DIY task for those comfortable with appliance repair. However, it requires specific parts and some technical skill. If you are unsure, calling a professional appliance technician is the safest option. A faulty drain pump is a clear reason for a dishwasher not draining water. It needs proper attention to restore your appliance's function. When your dishwasher does not drain, the drain pump is a critical component to investigate.

This resource covers various common issues.

### Air Gap or High Loop Problems Preventing Dishwasher Drainage

A crucial, yet often overlooked, component in preventing a dishwasher not draining water is the air gap or the proper high loop of the drain hose. Both systems prevent dirty sink water from flowing back into your clean dishwasher. Without one of these, you can get standing water in the tub even if the pump works.

An air gap is a small cylindrical fixture found on top of your kitchen sink or countertop. It has two hoses connected to it: one from the dishwasher drain pump and one to the garbage disposal or main drain. Its purpose is to create an air break, preventing a siphon effect that could draw wastewater back into the dishwasher. If this air gap becomes clogged with food particles or grease, it will restrict water flow. This prevents the dishwasher from draining properly.

To check an air gap, first remove the cap from the top of the fixture. Inspect the inside for any visible debris. Use a small brush or a toothpick to clear any blockages. You might also disconnect the hoses from the air gap. Then, clean them out if you suspect a clog. Reconnect everything tightly after cleaning. A clear air gap allows water to exit freely.

If you do not have an air gap, your dishwasher drain hose should have a "high loop." This means the drain hose rises to the underside of the countertop before descending to connect to the drain. This elevated loop serves the same purpose as an air gap: it prevents backflow and siphoning. If the high loop is missing or has dropped, it can cause water to drain back into the dishwasher. This leaves standing water.

I always advise homeowners to ensure their drain hose forms this high loop correctly. You can secure it to the underside of the counter with a clamp or strap. This simple setup keeps your dishwasher water clean and flowing in one direction. Understanding [where water drains in a dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-does-water-drain-in-dishwasher) helps you visualize these critical connections. Knowing the path water takes helps pinpoint problems.

Proper installation of either an air gap or a high loop is essential. It stops dirty water from returning to your appliance. If your dishwasher not draining water, these elements deserve a thorough check. They play a silent but vital role in your dishwasher's sanitation and efficiency.

This provides context for the entire system.

### Garbage Disposal Connection Issues Impacting Dishwasher Draining

Many dishwashers connect directly to a garbage disposal for drainage. If you have a disposal, issues with it can directly cause your dishwasher not draining water. There are two common problems related to this connection: a forgotten knock-out plug and a clogged disposal. Both prevent dirty water from leaving the dishwasher.

When installing a new garbage disposal, it often comes with a "knock-out plug" inside the dishwasher inlet port. This plug prevents water from entering the disposal until a dishwasher is connected. Installers must remove this plug before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. If this plug is not removed, water from the dishwasher has nowhere to go. It will simply sit in the bottom of the tub.

I have seen countless cases where this small plug caused significant drainage problems for new installations. To check for it, disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the garbage disposal. Look inside the disposal's inlet port where the hose attaches. If you see a metal or plastic plug, you need to remove it. You can usually knock it out with a screwdriver and a hammer. Then, retrieve the plug from inside the disposal chamber. This simple fix can resolve immediate drainage issues.

Even with the knock-out plug removed, a clogged garbage disposal itself can hinder dishwasher drainage. Food scraps, grease, and other debris can build up in the disposal. This obstructs the path for water from the dishwasher. If your disposal is running slowly or not at all, it likely affects your dishwasher.

Run your garbage disposal frequently to keep it clear. Always use cold water when running the disposal. This helps solidify grease so the disposal can grind it more effectively. If the disposal is jammed, try using the reset button on its underside. A specialized Allen wrench (often provided with the disposal) can help unjam the blades manually. Ensuring your garbage disposal functions properly is crucial for preventing your dishwasher not draining water. It ensures a clear path for wastewater to exit.

### Main House Plumbing Blockages and the Dishwasher

Sometimes, the reason your dishwasher is not draining water extends beyond the appliance itself. A clog in your main house plumbing can also prevent proper drainage. This situation is usually more complex and affects other fixtures in your kitchen. It is important to rule out appliance-specific problems first.

If you have checked the dishwasher filter, drain hose, air gap, drain pump, and garbage disposal, but water still stands, look at your sink. If your kitchen sink also drains slowly, or if water backs up into it when the dishwasher tries to drain, then you likely have a clog further down the main plumbing line. The dishwasher shares a drain line with the kitchen sink in many homes.

Clogs in the main drain line are often caused by grease, soap scum, and food debris accumulating over time. These blockages occur in the P-trap under the sink or further along the drain pipes. When this happens, water from the dishwasher has nowhere to go. It backs up into the lowest point, which is typically the dishwasher tub or the kitchen sink.

To address a main plumbing clog, you can first try a simple solution. Pour a mixture of baking soda and vinegar down the sink drain. Let it sit for an hour, then flush with hot water. This can sometimes dissolve minor clogs. For more stubborn blockages, you might need to use a drain snake. You can feed this tool down the sink drain to clear obstructions.

If these steps do not work, or if you are uncomfortable dealing with main plumbing, it is best to call a professional plumber. They have specialized equipment to locate and clear deep clogs. Recognizing a main plumbing blockage is key. It helps you decide if the problem is a DIY fix or requires professional help. Addressing these larger clogs ensures all your kitchen fixtures drain properly.

### Electrical or Component Failures in the Dishwasher Drain System

While most "dishwasher not draining water" issues stem from clogs, sometimes the problem is electrical or involves a faulty internal component. These issues are less common but require a different diagnostic approach. They can be more challenging to fix without professional help.

The dishwasher's control board or timer sends signals to the drain pump. If either of these components malfunctions, the pump might not receive the command to activate. This results in standing water. A faulty control board might manifest as other erratic behavior in the dishwasher, not just drainage problems. The appliance might fail to start cycles or show incorrect error codes.

Another internal component is the check valve. This small valve prevents water that has already drained from flowing back into the dishwasher tub. If the check valve gets stuck open or fails, dirty water can re-enter the tub. This might look like a drainage problem. The check valve is typically located near the drain pump or in the drain hose connection. You can usually access and inspect it for debris or damage. A damaged check valve needs replacement.

To diagnose electrical issues, you generally need a multimeter to test for continuity and voltage at various points. For instance, you can test if the drain pump is receiving power when it should. If the pump is getting power but not running, the pump itself is likely faulty. If the pump is not getting power, the issue points to the control board, timer, or wiring. This requires careful and precise testing.

I advise caution when dealing with electrical components. Always disconnect the power supply to the dishwasher before any inspection or repair. If you are not comfortable working with electricity or disassembling internal components, please call a qualified appliance technician. They can safely diagnose and repair these complex issues. Addressing these internal failures ensures your dishwasher functions correctly. It stops the frustrating problem of a dishwasher not draining water.
