## The American Foundation of King Koil Manufacturing

King Koil began its journey in the United States. It started in 1898 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Samuel Bronstein founded the company. He wanted to create better mattresses for people.

This adaptability ensures that each King Koil product resonates with its target audience. It is a smart way to compete effectively in diverse global markets.

## Types of King Koil Mattresses and Their Construction

Manufacturing these different types requires specialized processes. Factories need specific machinery for coil production. They also need equipment for pouring and cutting foam.
