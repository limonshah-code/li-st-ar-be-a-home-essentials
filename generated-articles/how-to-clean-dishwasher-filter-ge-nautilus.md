## Restore Your GE Nautilus: How To Clean Its Dishwasher Filter

Do you notice your dishes are not as clean as they used to be? Perhaps your GE Nautilus dishwasher smells bad. A dirty dishwasher filter often causes these issues. Cleaning the filter helps your dishwasher work best.

I often see homeowners overlook this simple task. Yet, it improves cleaning results significantly. Maintaining your GE Nautilus dishwasher is simple when you know the steps. This guide helps you understand filter cleaning. We will cover location, removal, cleaning steps, and reassembly. You will also learn about frequency and signs of a clogged filter.

### Takeaway

*   Locate the GE Nautilus dishwasher filter at the bottom of the tub.
*   Twist and lift the filter to remove it for cleaning.
*   Rinse the filter under warm water, scrubbing gently to remove debris.
*   Reinstall the filter by aligning it and twisting it into place.
*   Clean the filter at least once a month for optimal performance.

To clean a GE Nautilus dishwasher filter, locate the cylindrical filter at the base of the lower spray arm. Twist it counter-clockwise to unlock and lift it out. Rinse the filter components under warm running water to remove food particles and grease. Use a soft brush for stubborn debris. Then, reinsert the filter, twisting clockwise to secure it.

## Understanding Your GE Nautilus Dishwasher Filter

Your GE Nautilus dishwasher has a filter system. This system stops food debris from re-depositing on your clean dishes. It catches small food particles that wash off during the cycle. Without a clean filter, these particles can stick to your dishes. They also create bad smells inside the dishwasher.

Knowing your filter helps you keep your dishwasher working well. The GE Nautilus models typically use a two-part filter. This includes a coarse filter and a fine filter. The coarse filter is usually a larger cylinder. The fine filter fits inside it or connects closely. These parts work together to trap different sizes of debris.

The filter location is key for cleaning. You will find it at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It sits under the lower spray arm. Often, it looks like a round cylinder. You can easily access this part for removal. This design makes cleaning simple for anyone.

A clean filter means better washing performance. It means no leftover food bits on plates. It also prevents clogs in the drain pump. Regular cleaning extends the life of your appliance. Think of it as preventative care for your dishwasher. This simple step saves you from costly repairs later on.

## Tools You Need for GE Nautilus Filter Cleaning

Cleaning your GE Nautilus dishwasher filter does not need special tools. Most items you already have at home work well. Having the right supplies makes the job quick and easy. Being prepared avoids delays once you start.

First, you need warm water. Your kitchen sink provides this easily. A good flow of water helps rinse away food particles. Second, a soft brush helps remove stubborn debris. An old toothbrush works perfectly for this. You can also use a small nylon scrub brush. Avoid anything abrasive that could scratch the filter mesh.

You might also want dish soap or mild detergent. A small amount helps cut through grease and grime. This is especially useful if your filter is very dirty. Some people use white vinegar for deeper cleaning. Vinegar helps dissolve mineral deposits and deodorize. However, use it sparingly and rinse well.

Finally, a towel or paper towels are useful. You can use them to wipe down the filter area. They also help dry your hands. Having a small container can be helpful for soaking parts. This is optional, but it can help loosen stuck-on food. Gather these items before you begin. This helps ensure a smooth cleaning process.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Your GE Nautilus Filter

Removing the filter from your GE Nautilus dishwasher is a straightforward task. You do not need to be a repair expert to do it. Follow these steps carefully to prevent damage. Proper removal is the first step to a clean filter and sparkling dishes.

First, open the dishwasher door completely. Look at the bottom of the tub. You will see the lower spray arm. Underneath this arm is where the filter sits. It typically looks like a cylindrical component. You might see two parts to it.

Next, identify the locking mechanism. On most GE Nautilus models, the filter assembly has a handle or an arrow. This arrow points to "lock" or "unlock" positions. You need to grasp the top of the cylindrical filter. Gently twist it counter-clockwise. You should feel it disengage or unlock. It may click into place.

Once unlocked, lift the filter assembly straight up. Some models have a two-part filter. The coarse filter is usually the larger outer cylinder. The fine filter may be inside or attached to it. Separate these parts if your model allows. This helps clean each component thoroughly. If your GE dishwasher is an older model, the filter removal process may vary slightly. For older GE models, you might find specific instructions helpful by checking [how to clean filter in old GE dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-in-old-ge-dishwasher). Handle the parts with care. Avoid bending or breaking the mesh.

## Thoroughly Cleaning Your GE Nautilus Dishwasher Filter

Once you remove the filter parts, the real cleaning begins. This step removes trapped food and grease. A clean filter ensures your dishwasher works at its best. Taking your time now prevents future cleaning problems.

Start by rinsing the filter parts under warm, running water. Hold each part under the faucet. Let the water flow through the mesh. You will see many food particles wash away. This initial rinse gets rid of loose debris. Many people find a good rinse is enough for regular maintenance. For general dishwasher filter cleaning, you can always refer to [how to clean filter in dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-in-dishwasher).

Next, use a soft brush to scrub away stuck-on food. An old toothbrush works well for this. Gently scrub the mesh and plastic components. Focus on any visible food bits or slime. If there is stubborn grease, apply a small amount of dish soap. Work it into a lather with the brush. The soap helps break down oils and food residue.

If your filter has a foul smell or mineral deposits, consider soaking it. Fill a small basin with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. You can also add a splash of white vinegar. Let the filter parts soak for 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen tough grime. After soaking, rinse the filter thoroughly again. Make sure no soap residue remains. Any leftover soap could cause suds inside the dishwasher later.

Finally, inspect the filter carefully. Hold it up to a light. Check for any remaining particles or blockages. If you see any, repeat the scrubbing and rinsing. A truly clean filter will allow water to pass through easily. This step is vital for your GE Nautilus dishwasher's performance.

## Reinstalling the GE Nautilus Filter Correctly

Putting the filter back into your GE Nautilus dishwasher is just as important as cleaning it. Proper reinstallation ensures the filter works as intended. An incorrectly placed filter can lead to poor wash results or even damage. Take a moment to align everything correctly.

First, if you separated the filter parts, reassemble them. The fine filter typically fits inside the coarse filter. Make sure they connect securely. Your GE Nautilus model might have specific alignment points. Look for notches or arrows that show how they fit together. This ensures the filter assembly is ready for placement in the dishwasher.

Next, lower the assembled filter back into its slot at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It should fit snugly. The filter base often has a specific shape to guide it into place. Do not force it down. If it does not go in easily, check its orientation. It might need to be rotated slightly.

Once the filter is seated, twist it clockwise. This locks it back into position. You should feel a click or notice an arrow align. This indicates it is locked. The filter must be secure. If it is loose, it might vibrate during operation. A loose filter also allows debris to bypass the filtration system. Ensuring the filter is properly secured is similar to other dishwasher models. For a general guide on reinstallation, you can refer to [how to put dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in).

After reinstallation, give it a gentle tug. It should not lift out easily. This confirms it is locked. You are now ready to use your GE Nautilus dishwasher again. A properly reinstalled filter means clean dishes. It also means your dishwasher will continue to function effectively.

## How Often Should You Clean Your GE Nautilus Filter?

Cleaning frequency is important for your GE Nautilus dishwasher filter. Regular maintenance prevents problems before they start. Ignoring the filter leads to bigger issues. Knowing the right schedule helps you keep your appliance in top shape.

I suggest cleaning your GE Nautilus dishwasher filter at least once a month. This is a good general guideline for most households. If you use your dishwasher daily, or if you pre-rinse dishes less, you might clean it more often. For example, if you run multiple loads each day, consider cleaning it every two weeks. The frequency depends on your usage habits.

Certain signs indicate your filter needs immediate cleaning. You might see food particles on your "clean" dishes. This is a common sign of a clogged filter. A bad smell inside the dishwasher also points to filter issues. Trapped food decomposes and creates odors. If your dishes are still dirty after a wash, inspect the filter.

Another sign is water not draining properly. A severely clogged filter can block the drain path. This puts strain on the dishwasher's pump. If you notice any of these symptoms, do not wait. Clean the filter right away. Regular, proactive cleaning prevents these problems. It keeps your GE Nautilus running efficiently.

## Signs Your GE Nautilus Filter Needs Cleaning

Recognizing the signs of a dirty filter helps you act fast. Ignoring these warnings can hurt your GE Nautilus dishwasher's performance. It can also lead to more serious problems over time. Paying attention to these clues helps maintain your appliance.

The most common sign is dirty dishes after a wash cycle. You might see tiny food specks, grease, or a gritty residue on plates and glasses. The filter traps these particles. When it is full, it cannot catch them anymore. They re-circulate with the wash water. This leaves your dishes looking less than clean. It defeats the purpose of running the dishwasher.

Another clear indicator is a foul smell coming from the dishwasher. Trapped food particles decompose inside the filter. This creates an unpleasant odor. The smell can transfer to your dishes. It makes your kitchen smell bad too. A clean filter means a fresh-smelling dishwasher.

Poor drainage is a more serious sign. If water collects at the bottom of your dishwasher after a cycle, the filter might be severely clogged. The filter works with the drain pump. A block in the filter prevents water from flowing out. This can cause the dishwasher to work harder. It can even lead to error codes or pump failure.

Strange noises during operation can also point to a dirty filter. If the pump struggles due to a clog, it might hum or make grinding sounds. This indicates strain on the motor. Address these sounds quickly to avoid damage. Pay attention to your GE Nautilus. It often tells you when something is wrong.

## Troubleshooting Common GE Nautilus Filter Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues. Some problems can seem confusing at first. Knowing basic troubleshooting steps helps you resolve them quickly. Most filter-related problems have simple solutions.

One common issue is persistent bad odor even after cleaning the filter. This might mean the odor source is not just the filter. Food particles can get trapped in other areas. Check the drain hose for blockages. Also, clean the dishwasher tub walls and spray arms. A good cleaning cycle with vinegar or a dishwasher cleaner can help. If you're looking for ways to clean your GE dishwasher using vinegar, learn more at [how to clean GE dishwasher with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-ge-dishwasher with-vinegar).

Another problem is the filter not locking into place properly. You might have trouble twisting it clockwise. This often happens if the filter is not seated correctly. Remove it and reinsert it, ensuring it aligns perfectly. Check for any small food bits blocking the seating area. Sometimes, a tiny crumb can prevent proper engagement.

If you still see food particles on dishes despite a clean filter, inspect the spray arms. The holes on the spray arms can get clogged. These small holes spray water onto your dishes. If they are blocked, water pressure decreases. This means less effective cleaning. Remove the spray arms and clear any blockages with a toothpick.

Finally, if your dishwasher is making unusual noises or not draining, and the filter is clean, the problem might be elsewhere. The drain pump could have an issue. Or, a foreign object might be stuck in the sump area. For these issues, you might need a service technician. However, most problems can be solved by focusing on the filter and other accessible areas.

## Maximizing Your GE Nautilus Dishwasher's Lifespan

Keeping your GE Nautilus dishwasher clean goes beyond the filter. A few extra habits help your appliance last longer. These small actions make a big difference over time. They help you get the best performance from your dishwasher.

First, scrape large food pieces off plates before loading. Your dishwasher is for cleaning, not a garbage disposal. Large bits of food can clog the filter faster. They can also jam the drain pump. A quick scrape into the trash saves your filter from heavy work.

Second, use the right amount and type of detergent. Too much detergent can create excessive suds. This can leave a film on dishes. Too little detergent might not clean well. Use detergents designed for dishwashers. Avoid using hand soap. This can cause severe sudsing and machine damage.

Third, run a hot water cycle regularly. This helps sanitize the interior. It also melts away grease and grime. Some dishwashers have a sanitize cycle. If yours does, use it once a month. You can also run an empty cycle with a cup of white vinegar. This naturally cleans and deodorizes the interior.

Fourth, inspect the spray arms regularly. Small food particles can block the holes. This reduces water pressure. Remove the spray arms and clear any blockages. Use a toothpick or small wire. Clear spray arm holes mean better water distribution.

Lastly, clean the door gasket. The rubber seal around the door can collect grime. Wipe it down with a damp cloth. This prevents mold and mildew buildup. A clean gasket also ensures a good seal. Following these tips keeps your GE Nautilus running like new for years.

## Advanced Tips for GE Nautilus Dishwasher Maintenance

Beyond regular filter cleaning, there are other steps you can take. These advanced tips help keep your GE Nautilus dishwasher running at peak efficiency. They address areas often overlooked. Implementing them ensures comprehensive care for your appliance.

Consider checking the drain hose for kinks or blockages. The drain hose connects the dishwasher to your home's plumbing. If it becomes kinked, water cannot drain properly. This leads to standing water and bad smells. Pull the dishwasher out slightly if needed. Inspect the hose for bends. Also, ensure the air gap (if present) is clear.

Periodically clean the detergent dispenser. Residue from detergent can build up. This stops the dispenser from opening correctly. It also prevents the detergent from dissolving fully. Wipe the dispenser area with a damp cloth. Make sure the flap opens freely.

Check your water hardness. Hard water contains minerals that can build up. These minerals form limescale inside the dishwasher. Limescale affects heating elements and pump efficiency. If you have hard water, use a dishwasher cleaner designed to remove limescale. Run it empty once every few months. Some dishwashers have a water softener setting. Adjust this if your water is very hard.

Inspect the racks and their coatings. Over time, plastic coatings can chip or rust. This exposes metal, which can stain dishes. Replace damaged racks if necessary. Ensure the wheels on the racks move freely. Lubricate them with food-grade silicone spray if they stick.

Lastly, pay attention to any error codes. Your GE Nautilus dishwasher will display codes if something is wrong. Consult your owner's manual for code meanings. Address error codes promptly. This prevents small issues from becoming major repairs. These advanced steps help extend your GE Nautilus dishwasher's life.
