## Understanding Grammys Red Carpet Start Times

The Grammys red carpet start time is a crucial detail for fans across the country. Networks air this pre-show event live, meaning timings differ based on your location. Most often, the main event begins at 5:00 PM PT / 8:00 PM ET. The red carpet generally precedes this by a few hours. This allows ample time for celebrity arrivals and media coverage.

I always find it exciting to tune in early. This early start ensures you catch all the best fashion and initial interviews. The event's host city influences the live broadcast schedule. Typically, Los Angeles hosts the Grammys, making Pacific Time the primary reference. If you live on the East Coast, you need to adjust for the time difference.

### West Coast vs. East Coast Timings
