While some people might wonder [how much it costs to install a built-in microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-to-install-built-in-microwave) professionally, prioritizing safety for a DIY job is non-negotiable.

## Removing Your Old Microwave: A Smooth Transition

Replacing an old microwave with a new LG model often means removing the existing unit first. This step needs care to avoid damage to your kitchen or yourself. We will walk you through the process of safely taking down your old appliance. This prepares your space for the new installation.

First, ensure the power to the microwave outlet is completely off. We covered this in the safety section; double-check it with a voltage tester. Next, open the cabinet above the microwave. You will find screws or bolts that secure the microwave to the bottom of this cabinet. These are usually on the upper corners of the microwave. Use a screwdriver or socket wrench to loosen and remove these fasteners. Keep track of them; you might reuse them or need them for reference later.

Most over-the-range microwaves also have a mounting plate or bracket on the wall behind them. This plate supports the back of the microwave. Sometimes, the microwave hooks onto this plate. You may need to lift the front of the microwave slightly. Then, gently push it up and off the mounting plate. Have a second person help support the microwave from below as you remove the securing screws. This prevents the heavy unit from falling suddenly. We followed a similar process when learning [how to install a Whirlpool microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-whirlpool-microwave), as the general removal steps are often similar across brands.

Once detached, carefully lower the old microwave. Carry it out of the kitchen space. Be mindful of its weight. You might need to disconnect any existing ventilation ductwork if it was externally vented. Simply unhook the duct from the top of the microwave. Clean the area where the old microwave sat. Remove the old wall mounting plate. You will replace this with the new LG mounting bracket. Patch any holes if they are not needed for the new installation. Disposing of the old appliance responsibly is also important. Many local waste management services offer appliance pickup.

## Mounting the LG Microwave Bracket and Template

Mounting the bracket correctly is perhaps the most critical step for stable installation. The bracket holds the majority of the microwave's weight. Accuracy here ensures your LG microwave is level and secure. This section guides you through using the template and securing the mounting plate.

Every new LG microwave comes with a paper template. This template shows you where to drill holes for the wall mounting plate and the upper cabinet bolts. Begin by taping the template to the wall. Align it carefully with your kitchen cabinets. The bottom edge of the template should align with the desired bottom height of your microwave. Many installations place the microwave 13 to 18 inches above the cooking surface. Use a level to ensure the template is perfectly straight. My own installation showed that even a slight misalignment here can cause problems later.

Once the template is aligned, mark the drill points for the wall mounting plate. These marks will tell you where to screw the bracket into the wall. Also, mark the drill points for the holes that go through the bottom of the upper cabinet. These holes are for the bolts that secure the top of the microwave.

### Wall Studs and Proper Anchorage

The wall mounting bracket must be securely fastened to at least one wall stud. Wall studs are the vertical wooden or metal framing members inside your wall. They provide the necessary strength to support the microwave's weight. Use a stud finder to locate these studs. Mark their center points on the wall. Adjust your template slightly if needed to ensure at least one mounting screw goes directly into a stud.

If you cannot hit a stud for all mounting points, use heavy-duty toggle bolts or other appropriate wall anchors for drywall sections. These anchors expand behind the drywall and provide strong support. However, relying on at least one stud connection is always best for safety and stability. For certain installations, especially if you want to know [how to install an LG microwave under cabinet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-lg-microwave-under-cabinet) in a way that is not over the range, the mounting method might differ slightly, focusing more on cabinet support rather than wall studs.

After marking the drill points, use your drill to make pilot holes. The size of the drill bit depends on the type of screws or bolts you are using. Refer to your LG microwave's manual for the exact drill bit size. Drill slowly and carefully. Once the holes are ready, position the mounting bracket. Screw it firmly into the pilot holes. Make sure the bracket is level before fully tightening all screws. The bracket must be flush against the wall. This provides a stable base for the microwave.

### Ceiling Cabinet Support

In addition to the wall bracket, over-the-range microwaves also secure to the cabinet above. This prevents the front of the microwave from tilting forward. For this, you use the drill points you marked on the bottom of the upper cabinet. These holes will typically accommodate long bolts that pass through the cabinet bottom and thread into the top of the microwave itself. Ensure these holes are drilled cleanly. These bolts work with the wall bracket to hold the microwave firmly in place.

## Ventilation Setup for Your LG Microwave

Proper ventilation is crucial for your LG microwave. It removes steam, smoke, and cooking odors from your kitchen. LG microwaves typically offer several ventilation options. You must choose the right one for your home and configure the microwave's blower motor accordingly. This step ensures clean air and efficient operation.

Most LG over-the-range microwaves come factory set for recirculating ventilation. This means the air is filtered and then returned into the kitchen. If you plan to use an external vent, you will need to adjust the blower motor. This usually involves removing a few screws, rotating the motor assembly, and reattasing it. Your LG microwave manual will have specific instructions for this process. It might be a simple rotation or require moving a fan blade. Incorrect blower setup can lead to poor airflow.

Here are the common ventilation methods:

*   **Recirculating (Non-Vented):** Air is drawn through grease filters, passed through a charcoal filter (to remove odors), and then blown back into the kitchen through vents at the top front of the microwave. This is the easiest to install as it requires no ductwork. It is suitable for apartments or homes without existing external ducting.
*   **Vertical Exhaust (Top Vent):** Air is vented straight up through a duct connected to the top of the microwave. This duct typically goes into a cabinet above and then exits through the roof or a wall. This is a very effective way to remove fumes.
*   **Horizontal Exhaust (Rear Vent):** Air is vented directly out the back of the microwave, through an opening in the wall behind it. This requires a dedicated opening in your wall leading outside.

### Adjusting the Blower Motor

Before lifting the microwave, you must configure the blower motor if you are not using recirculating ventilation. Remove the fan motor cover, typically found on the top or back of the microwave. Carefully detach the blower motor assembly. Most LG models allow you to rotate the blower 90 or 180 degrees to change the exhaust direction. For example, to switch from recirculating to vertical exhaust, you would turn the blower to face upwards.

After rotating, reattach the blower motor securely. Make sure all screws are tightened. If you are using external venting, you will also need to remove the knockout plate on the top or back of the microwave. This plate is where the ductwork will connect. You might also need to install a damper. A damper is a flap that prevents outside air from coming back in when the fan is off. This is a key step to [install an LG microwave vent cover](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-lg-microwave-vent-cover) properly.

### Connecting Ductwork

If you are using vertical or horizontal exhaust, you will need to connect ductwork. Ensure the duct size matches the microwave's exhaust port (usually 3 1/4" x 10" rectangular or 6" round). Use appropriate connectors and aluminum foil tape to seal all seams. This prevents air leaks. Proper sealing ensures maximum airflow and efficiency. Poorly sealed ducts reduce the effectiveness of your ventilation. Make sure the ductwork is clear of obstructions and has a direct path to the outside. My own project required careful measurement of the existing duct to ensure a tight seal.

## Lifting and Securing the LG Microwave Unit

This step requires strength and precision. The microwave is heavy, so do not try to lift it alone. Having a helper is crucial for safety and ease of installation. This section guides you through lifting the LG microwave onto its mounting bracket and securing it permanently.

Before you lift, ensure the power cord is accessible. It needs to pass through the hole in the bottom of the upper cabinet and reach the power outlet. Have your helper stand ready to assist. One person should lift the microwave from the bottom. The other person can guide the top. As you lift the LG microwave, angle it slightly. This allows the bottom lip on the back of the microwave to hook onto the lower edge of the wall mounting bracket.

Once the microwave is hooked onto the bracket, push the bottom of the microwave against the wall. This secures it firmly to the bracket. The helper can hold the microwave in place while you move to the next part. Ensure the microwave feels stable on the bracket before proceeding. This is the moment the microwave takes its final position. You are on your way to enjoying your new appliance. If you're wondering if you [can install an over-the-range microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-install-an-over-the-range-microwave) yourself, this step is often the most challenging without help.

### Feeding the Power Cord

While the microwave is supported by the bracket, guide the power cord. It needs to pass through the designated hole in the bottom of the cabinet above. Make sure the cord is not pinched or tangled. It should hang freely and reach the electrical outlet. Do not plug it in yet.

### Securing the Unit with Upper Cabinet Bolts

Now, you will secure the top of the microwave to the cabinet above. This prevents the microwave from tipping forward. From inside the upper cabinet, locate the holes you drilled earlier. These holes align with threaded inserts on the top of the LG microwave. Insert the long mounting bolts through the cabinet bottom and into the microwave's top.

Use a screwdriver or socket wrench to tighten these bolts. Tighten them evenly. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the cabinet or the microwave. Just make them snug. Check that the microwave is level using your spirit level. Adjust the tightness of the bolts slightly if needed to achieve a perfect level. A level microwave cooks food more evenly and looks better in your kitchen. This part ensures the microwave is truly stable and safe for daily use.

## Final Checks and Testing Your LG Microwave

You are almost done! The LG microwave is now physically installed. The next critical step is to perform final checks and test its functions. This ensures everything works as it should. It also confirms the installation is safe and complete. Do not skip this important stage.

First, double-check all connections. Ensure the mounting bracket is secure. Confirm the top cabinet bolts are tight. Look behind the microwave to make sure the power cord is not pinched. Also, verify that any ventilation ductwork is properly connected and sealed. These final visual inspections catch simple mistakes.

Now, it is time to connect the power. Go back to your electrical panel. Flip the circuit breaker for the microwave outlet back to the "ON" position. Your LG microwave should now receive power. The display panel on the microwave should light up. If it does not, recheck your power connection and the circuit breaker. Sometimes, a quick power cycle at the breaker can resolve minor issues.

### Testing Basic Functions

Once powered on, perform a series of tests. This confirms your LG microwave works correctly after installation.

1.  **Light and Fan:** Press the buttons for the interior light and the exhaust fan. Both should operate. Check the fan speed settings. For external venting, ensure you feel air moving outside the house.
2.  **Heating Test:** Place a cup of water inside the microwave. Close the door firmly. Set the microwave for one minute at full power. Start the microwave. Listen for any unusual noises. The turntable should rotate smoothly. After one minute, the water should be hot. If it is not, recheck the power supply and consult the troubleshooting section of your manual. Understanding [how your LG microwave works](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-work-lg-microwave) will help you identify any anomalies.
3.  **Stability Check:** Gently push on the microwave from different angles. It should feel solid and not wobble. If there is any movement, recheck the tightness of the mounting screws and bolts.

### Cleaning Up the Installation Area

After successful testing, clean up your workspace. Put away all your tools. Dispose of any packaging materials. Wipe down the new LG microwave and the surrounding cabinet surfaces. Remove any pencil marks or fingerprints. This leaves your kitchen sparkling with its new appliance. My own satisfaction comes from seeing a clean, functional space.

## Troubleshooting Common LG Microwave Installation Issues

Even with careful planning, sometimes small issues arise during installation. Do not worry. Many common problems have simple solutions. This section helps you diagnose and fix typical issues you might encounter when you install your LG microwave.

### Microwave Not Turning On

If your new LG microwave does not power on, start with the power source. First, check the circuit breaker at your home's electrical panel. Ensure it is in the "ON" position. Sometimes, it might have tripped during installation. If it is off, reset it. Next, verify the microwave's power cord is fully plugged into the wall outlet. Ensure the outlet itself is working by plugging in another small appliance. If the problem persists, the issue could be with the microwave itself. You might consider trying to [reset your LG microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-your-lg-microwave) as a troubleshooting step, though this is less common for new installations.

### Unit Not Level or Stable

A wobbly or unlevel microwave is a common issue. This usually points to improper mounting. Recheck the wall mounting bracket. Ensure it is perfectly level before tightening its screws. Use your spirit level to confirm. Also, verify that the bolts securing the top of the microwave to the cabinet are tightened evenly. If one side is tighter than the other, it can cause tilting. Adjust them slowly until the microwave is level and feels solid. You may need to loosen all fasteners slightly and re-level the unit before retightening.

### Ventilation Problems

If your exhaust fan seems weak or ineffective, check the ventilation setup. First, ensure the blower motor is correctly oriented for your chosen venting method (recirculating, vertical, or horizontal). If it is set for recirculating but you have external ducts, the air will not go outside. Next, inspect the ductwork. Look for any kinks, obstructions, or loose connections. All duct seams should be sealed with foil tape to prevent air leaks. A blocked or leaky duct significantly reduces airflow. Check the damper as well; sometimes it can get stuck closed.

### Addressing Buzzing or Unusual Noises

A slight hum is normal when a microwave is running. However, loud buzzing or grinding noises indicate a problem. First, check the turntable and its support ring inside the microwave. Ensure they are correctly seated and nothing is obstructing their rotation. Sometimes, internal components might shift slightly during installation. If the noise comes from the fan, check for loose parts or debris in the blower housing. Always ensure the mounting screws are tight, as loose connections can cause vibrations. If the noises are persistent and loud, and all visual checks are clear, contact LG customer support.

These troubleshooting tips resolve most common installation issues. Always prioritize safety. If you are uncertain about any step, seek professional help.
