Yes, the Roomba 985 works well on carpets. It features a Power Boost mode that automatically increases suction on carpeted surfaces. Its dual multi-surface rubber brushes are designed to agitate carpet fibers and lift dirt and debris. This combination allows the Roomba 985 to clean various carpet types, from low-pile to medium-pile, with good results.

## Understanding Roomba 985's Core Carpet Cleaning Features

The Roomba 985 comes equipped with specific features to tackle carpets. These design choices aim to maximize dirt removal from fibrous surfaces. I find these elements are key to its performance in homes with rugs and carpets. Understanding them helps you see why the 985 model stands out for this task.

### Power Boost Technology Explained

One of the standout features of the Roomba 985 is its Power Boost technology. This intelligent system automatically detects when the robot is on carpet. Upon detection, it increases the vacuum's suction power significantly. This surge in power helps pull more dirt, dust, and pet hair from deep within carpet fibers. It is a crucial function for effective carpet cleaning.

### Dual Multi-Surface Rubber Brushes

Instead of traditional bristle brushes, the Roomba 985 uses dual multi-surface rubber brushes. These brushes are designed to flex and adjust to various surfaces. On carpets, they work together to agitate and lift debris without tangling with hair or fibers. This unique design minimizes hair wrap and improves cleaning efficiency. I really appreciate how easy these brushes are to clean after a run.

### High-Efficiency Filter

The Roomba 985 includes a high-efficiency filter. This filter captures 99% of allergens, pollen, and dust mites. For carpeted homes, this means cleaner air in addition to clean floors. It helps trap fine particles that the vacuum lifts from the carpet. Regular cleaning of this filter maintains the vacuum's strong suction power.

## Performance Across Different Carpet Types

The Roomba 985 handles various carpet types differently. Its cleaning capability changes based on the carpet's pile height and density. I have seen it perform very well on some carpets, and less so on others. Knowing these differences helps set proper expectations for your home.

### Low-Pile Carpets and Area Rugs

On low-pile carpets and area rugs, the Roomba 985 performs exceptionally well. Its Power Boost mode quickly engages, providing strong suction. The rubber brushes effectively agitate the short fibers, lifting embedded dirt and pet hair. Most users will find excellent results on these surfaces, achieving a visibly clean look. My own experience confirms its efficiency here.

### Medium-Pile Carpets

For medium-pile carpets, the Roomba 985 still offers good performance. The increased suction power helps reach deeper into the carpet. However, it might require multiple passes to get thoroughly clean. The robot adjusts its cleaning path to ensure comprehensive coverage. It is still a strong contender for homes with medium-pile carpeting.

### High-Pile and Shag Carpets

When it comes to high-pile or shag carpets, the Roomba 985 faces more challenges. The long fibers can sometimes impede the robot's movement or get caught in the brushes. While it will attempt to clean, its effectiveness may be reduced. Very thick rugs can even cause the robot to get stuck. I would recommend caution or alternative cleaning methods for these specific carpet types. For stubborn carpet issues, sometimes a more direct approach is needed; understanding [does a carpet rake work](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-a-carpet-rake-work) might offer additional cleaning insights.

## Smart Navigation and Adaptation on Carpets

The Roomba 985 does more than just suck up dirt; it navigates your home with intelligence. Its smart systems allow it to adapt its cleaning on different surfaces. This means it can methodically clean your carpeted areas without missing spots. I find this aspect of robot vacuums incredibly helpful for consistent cleaning.

### iAdapt 2.0 Navigation with Visual Localization

The Roomba 985 uses iAdapt 2.0 Navigation with Visual Localization. This technology allows the robot to map its surroundings and keep track of where it has cleaned. It creates a visual map of your home, ensuring it covers every part of your carpeted floors. This systematic approach means no more random cleaning patterns or missed patches. I have watched it move efficiently, knowing where it needs to go next.

### Dirt Detect Technology

Roomba 985 features Dirt Detect Technology. This system uses acoustic and optical sensors to identify concentrated areas of dirt. When the robot finds a particularly dirty spot on your carpet, it performs a more focused, back-and-forth cleaning pattern. This ensures that areas needing extra attention receive it, improving overall cleanliness. It is like having a tiny, intelligent cleaner focusing on tough spots.

### Edge Cleaning and Furniture Navigation

The Roomba 985 is also designed to clean along edges and navigate around furniture. It uses its sensors to detect walls and obstacles, cleaning right up to the baseboards. On carpets, this means it gets into corners and along furniture legs, pulling dirt from these often-missed areas. It moves smoothly from hard floors to carpets, adapting its cleaning mode as it goes. This seamless transition is a real benefit for homes with mixed flooring.

## Battery Life and Cleaning Coverage for Carpeted Homes

Battery life is a significant factor, especially for larger homes with extensive carpeting. The Roomba 985's battery performance directly affects how much area it can cover. Understanding its runtime and recharge capabilities helps manage your cleaning expectations. I always consider battery life when recommending any robot vacuum.

### Runtime and Recharge and Resume

The Roomba 985 provides up to 120 minutes of runtime on a full charge. This is a decent duration for many homes, allowing it to cover substantial carpeted areas. If the battery runs low before the cleaning job is done, it automatically returns to its charging base. After recharging, it resumes cleaning exactly where it left off, ensuring a complete clean. This "Recharge and Resume" feature is vital for large homes.

### Impact of Power Boost on Battery Life

It is important to note that the Power Boost mode, while effective, consumes more battery power. When the Roomba 985 is constantly on carpet and boosting suction, its actual runtime might be closer to 90 minutes. This is a trade-off for deeper cleaning. I find planning cleaning schedules for specific areas helps manage this. For homes with mostly carpets, setting shorter, more frequent cleaning sessions can be beneficial.

### Efficient Coverage of Large Carpeted Areas

Despite the potential for reduced runtime in Power Boost mode, the Roomba 985 still covers large carpeted areas efficiently. Its iAdapt 2.0 navigation ensures systematic cleaning paths, minimizing wasted energy. It does not wander aimlessly, but rather moves in organized rows. This intelligent movement maximizes the cleaned area per battery charge, even on carpets. I appreciate how it methodically works its way through rooms.

## Maximizing Roomba 985's Effectiveness on Carpets

To get the best out of your Roomba 985 on carpets, a few simple practices can make a big difference. These tips help the robot work more efficiently and extend its lifespan. I always share these suggestions with friends who own robot vacuums. A little preparation goes a long way.

### Pre-Cleaning Tips for Carpeted Floors

Before running your Roomba 985, take a few moments to prepare the carpeted area. Remove any small objects, toys, or loose cables from the floor. Also, trim any long rug fringes that could get tangled in the brushes. This simple step prevents the robot from getting stuck and allows it to clean more smoothly. A clear path means a more thorough clean.

### Regular Maintenance for Optimal Suction

Maintaining your Roomba 985 is crucial, especially when cleaning carpets. Regularly check and clean the multi-surface rubber brushes to remove any hair or debris. Empty the dustbin after every cleaning cycle, as carpets tend to produce more dirt. Clean or replace the high-efficiency filter regularly to maintain strong suction power. These steps ensure your robot vacuum continues to perform at its best.

### Utilizing Virtual Walls and No-Go Zones

For certain areas, like very high-pile rugs or delicate items, consider using virtual walls or creating no-go zones. These accessories prevent the Roomba 985 from entering specific areas. This can protect delicate items or keep the robot from getting stuck on challenging carpet types. It gives you control over where your robot cleans and avoids potential issues. I often use these for my kids' play areas.

## Comparing Roomba 985 to Newer Models for Carpet Cleaning

While the Roomba 985 is a few years old, it still holds its own in the world of robot vacuums. Newer models often boast incremental improvements, but the 985 offers significant value. It is important to understand where it stands compared to newer, more expensive options. I find its proven performance still makes it a strong choice.

Newer Roomba models, like those in the j or s series, often feature even more advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance. They might also have stronger suction ratings or self-emptying dustbins. These advancements provide convenience and possibly slightly better deep cleaning on very thick carpets. However, these features often come at a much higher price point.
