## Troubleshoot: Whirlpool Dryer Runs But No Heat

It is frustrating when your Whirlpool dryer runs but no heat comes out. You put in a wet load, start the cycle, and hear the familiar hum. However, after an hour, the clothes are still damp, or even cold. This common appliance problem leaves you with piles of wet laundry and a sense of confusion.

Understanding the root cause helps you fix the issue. A Whirlpool dryer without heat can stem from several problems, from simple blockages to faulty components. I will guide you through the most common reasons and provide actionable steps to diagnose and repair your dryer. We will explore everything from basic maintenance tasks to component testing. By the end, you will understand why your dryer stopped heating and how to get it working again.

### Takeaway

If your Whirlpool dryer runs but lacks heat, check these key areas:

*   **Thermal Fuse:** Test for continuity; replace if blown.
*   **Heating Element:** Inspect for breaks; replace if damaged.
*   **Vent System:** Clean lint trap and exhaust vent thoroughly.
*   **Thermostats:** Test for proper function; replace faulty ones.
*   **Gas Igniter/Solenoids (Gas Dryers):** Check for proper ignition.
*   **Power Supply:** Verify correct voltage and circuit breaker status.

When your Whirlpool dryer runs but no heat comes out, common culprits include a blown thermal fuse, a failed heating element, a clogged dryer vent, or a faulty thermal cut-off or thermostat. Power supply issues or a malfunctioning igniter (for gas models) can also prevent heating.

## Whirlpool Dryer Runs But No Heat? Start Here

When your Whirlpool dryer runs, but fails to produce heat, it signifies a specific set of problems within its heating system. You hear the drum turning, and the motor operates, but the crucial warmth needed for drying clothes is absent. This issue differs from a dryer that does not start at all. Your appliance receives power and attempts to complete its cycle, just without the necessary heat.

Understanding the difference between electric and gas dryers is important. Electric dryers use a heating element to generate warmth, while gas dryers use an igniter and gas valve solenoids to light a burner. Both types rely on thermostats and a clear vent system to maintain proper temperatures and airflow. A problem in any of these areas can stop the heat. We will explore the common components that lead to this frustrating lack of heat. Identifying your dryer type helps narrow down potential causes immediately.

I recommend starting with the simplest checks first. Ensure the dryer is fully plugged into a working outlet. Check your home's circuit breaker for any tripped switches. Sometimes, a partial power supply can run the motor but not energize the heating circuit. We will then move into more detailed troubleshooting steps for specific parts that control heat generation.

## Blown Thermal Fuse: A Common Reason for No Heat

A blown thermal fuse is one of the most common reasons a Whirlpool dryer runs but produces no heat. The thermal fuse is a safety device. It is a small, inexpensive component located near the heating element or blower housing. Its purpose is to protect your dryer from overheating. If the dryer's temperature exceeds a safe limit, the thermal fuse will blow. This action breaks the electrical circuit to the heating element, cutting off the heat. However, the dryer motor may still continue to run.

A thermal fuse usually blows due to restricted airflow, which causes the dryer to overheat. Common causes of restricted airflow include a clogged lint screen, a blocked dryer vent, or a faulty blower wheel. If your thermal fuse has blown, you must replace it. Before replacing, identify and fix the underlying cause of the overheating. Otherwise, the new fuse will likely blow again shortly after installation. This issue is so common that [your Whirlpool dryer may keep blowing the thermal fuse](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dryer-keep-blowing-the-thermal-fuse) if you do not address the root problem.

Testing a thermal fuse requires a multimeter. Disconnect the dryer from power. Locate the fuse, which often looks like a small plastic cylinder with two wire terminals. Disconnect the wires and touch the multimeter probes to each terminal. If the multimeter reads infinite resistance or "OL" (open line), the fuse is blown and needs replacement. A good fuse will show a reading close to zero ohms (continuity). Always ensure you buy the correct replacement part for your specific Whirlpool model.

## Failed Heating Element or Igniter Issues

The core of your dryer's heat production lies in either the heating element (for electric dryers) or the igniter and gas valve solenoids (for gas dryers). When these components fail, your dryer will run but generate no warmth. Identifying which component is faulty depends on your dryer's power source.

### Electric Dryer: Heating Element Failure

Electric dryers rely on a large, coiled heating element. This element heats up when electricity flows through it, much like the coils on an electric stove. Over time, these coils can break or burn out. When the heating element breaks, it creates an open circuit. This prevents electricity from flowing through and generating heat. You can often spot a failed heating element by visual inspection. Look for a visible break or black spots on the coil.

To confirm a heating element failure, you need a multimeter. Disconnect power to the dryer. Access the heating element, typically located in the rear of the dryer. Disconnect its wires. Set your multimeter to measure resistance (ohms). Place the probes on the element's terminals. A good heating element will show a resistance reading, usually between 8 and 25 ohms, depending on the model. An infinite reading or "OL" indicates a broken element that requires replacement.

### Gas Dryer: Igniter or Gas Valve Solenoid Problems

Gas dryers use natural gas or propane to produce heat. A glow bar igniter heats up until it is hot enough to ignite the gas. The gas then flows through gas valve solenoids and into the burner assembly. If the igniter fails to glow, or if the solenoids do not open to allow gas flow, the burner will not light. Consequently, the dryer produces no heat.

Troubleshooting a gas dryer often involves checking the igniter for cracks or damage. A healthy igniter will glow bright orange when it attempts to light. If it glows faintly or not at all, it may be faulty. You can test the igniter's resistance with a multimeter; it should have continuity. Gas valve solenoids can also fail, preventing gas from reaching the burner. These are trickier to test directly without specialized tools, but you can listen for an audible click when the dryer attempts to ignite. If the igniter glows but no flame appears, the solenoids are a likely culprit. For these components, professional assistance may be necessary if you are uncomfortable working with gas lines.

## Clogged Vent or Airflow Obstructions

A clogged dryer vent is a major cause of a Whirlpool dryer running without heat. It is also a significant fire hazard. Proper airflow is essential for a dryer to heat efficiently and safely. Hot, moist air needs a clear path to exit the dryer and vent outside your home. When the vent system becomes blocked with lint, the hot air gets trapped inside the dryer drum. This causes the internal temperature to rise excessively.

When the dryer overheats due to a clogged vent, safety mechanisms kick in. The thermal fuse, which we discussed earlier, will blow to prevent damage and potential fires. Even if the thermal fuse has not blown yet, restricted airflow significantly reduces the dryer's ability to produce and maintain heat. The dryer senses the trapped heat and may cycle off the heating element prematurely. This results in clothes taking much longer to dry, often feeling damp and cool even after a full cycle. In some cases, your dryer may even display a "check vent" error message. If your [Whirlpool dryer keeps saying check vent](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dryer-keep-saying-check-vent), it is a clear sign of an airflow problem.

Regular maintenance is key to preventing vent blockages. Always clean the lint trap before every load. Periodically, you should thoroughly clean the exhaust vent system itself. This includes the ductwork behind the dryer, the vent hood outside your home, and sometimes even inside the dryer's blower housing. Lint builds up in these areas over time, reducing airflow. You can use a dryer vent cleaning kit or hire a professional for this task. Maintaining clear vents improves your dryer's efficiency and helps ensure it always produces adequate heat.

## Faulty Thermostats or Thermal Cut-Offs

Whirlpool dryers use multiple thermostats and a thermal cut-off to regulate temperature and ensure safe operation. These components play a crucial role in the heating process. If any of these parts malfunction, your dryer may run but fail to produce heat, or it might overheat and then lose heat.

The operating thermostat is responsible for maintaining the correct drying temperature inside the drum. It cycles the heating element on and off as needed. If this thermostat fails, it might not signal the heating element to turn on at all, or it could prevent it from staying on long enough. This results in insufficient heat for drying. The high-limit thermostat acts as a secondary safety device. It monitors the temperature in the heating element housing. If the temperature gets too high, this thermostat opens the circuit to the heating element, cutting off power to prevent overheating.

The thermal cut-off is an even higher-level safety device, often paired with the heating element or blower. It is designed to trip permanently if the dryer reaches an extreme temperature. Once a thermal cut-off trips, it must be replaced. Unlike some thermostats, it does not reset. If this part fails open, the dryer will run, but the heating element will not receive power. A faulty thermostat or thermal cut-off can often be diagnosed using a multimeter to check for continuity. Disconnect the dryer from power before testing. Remove the wires from the thermostat terminals and test across them. A good thermostat will show continuity at room temperature, while a faulty one will show an open circuit if it has failed.

Replacing these components is usually straightforward. However, it requires careful identification of the correct part for your specific Whirlpool dryer model. Always ensure the dryer is unplugged before attempting any repairs involving electrical components. Proper function of these thermostats ensures both effective drying and user safety.

## Power Supply Problems: When Heat Won't Turn On

Even if your Whirlpool dryer motor runs, a power supply issue can still prevent the heating element from working. Dryers require a specific electrical connection for their heating functions. Electric dryers, in particular, often need a 240-volt circuit to power their heating elements, while the motor and controls might only require 120 volts. If only one leg of the 240-volt supply is active, the dryer will tumble, but the heating element will not receive enough power to generate heat.

The first place to check is your home's circuit breaker panel. Locate the breaker for your dryer. Electric dryers typically use a double-pole breaker, which looks like two connected switches. If one side of this breaker has tripped, or if the entire breaker is off, it can interrupt the power supply to the heating element. Try resetting the breaker by flipping it completely off, then back on. If the breaker trips immediately again, you may have a short circuit in the dryer or an overloaded circuit. Do not ignore a frequently tripping breaker.

Beyond the breaker, inspect the dryer's power cord and the wall outlet. Ensure the cord is firmly plugged in and shows no signs of damage or scorching. A loose connection at the outlet or the dryer's terminal block can also lead to partial power supply issues. Sometimes, the problem lies with the wall outlet itself, requiring an electrician to test or replace it. If you suspect an electrical issue beyond a simple breaker reset, it is always best to consult a qualified electrician. Attempting to diagnose complex electrical problems without proper knowledge and tools can be dangerous.

## Less Common Causes and Professional Help

While thermal fuses, heating elements, vents, and thermostats cover the majority of "dryer runs but no heat" issues, some less common culprits might be at play. Understanding these can help in more complex troubleshooting or when deciding to call a professional.

One less common issue could be a faulty **timer or control board**. The dryer's timer or electronic control board sends voltage to the heating element and other components. If these parts malfunction, they might fail to send the "heat" signal, even if the dryer's motor is running. Diagnosing these requires advanced electrical knowledge and often a technician's specific diagnostic tools. Replacing a control board can also be an expensive repair, sometimes justifying the cost of a new appliance.

A **failed drive motor** can also indirectly cause a lack of heat. While the motor usually makes the drum spin, some dryer motors also have an internal switch that supplies power to the heating circuit. If this switch fails, the dryer might spin, but the heat never kicks in. Testing this often involves checking the motor's internal continuity, a task best left to a professional.

Lastly, the **moisture sensor** could be at fault, though less likely to completely eliminate heat. Some modern Whirlpool dryers use moisture sensors to detect when clothes are dry and shut off the heat. If these sensors are dirty or faulty, they might prematurely signal that clothes are dry, turning off the heat early. This often leads to clothes still being damp, making it seem like there is no heat, or that [your Whirlpool dryer takes two cycles to dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dryer-take-two-cycles-to-dry). Cleaning the moisture sensor bars (usually two metal strips inside the drum) can sometimes resolve this.

If you have systematically checked all the common components and your Whirlpool dryer still runs without heat, it is often time to consider professional assistance. Dealing with advanced electrical issues or complex control board diagnostics is safer and more efficient for a certified appliance technician. They possess the tools and expertise to pinpoint elusive problems and perform repairs safely.

## FAQ Section

### Why would my Whirlpool dryer run but not get hot?
Your Whirlpool dryer may run without heat due to several reasons.
