I will provide simple steps to troubleshoot and fix these problems yourself. You can get your LG oven working again, saving money on professional repairs.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Power:** Confirm the oven has power and the circuit breaker is on.
*   **Inspect Elements:** Visually check bake and broil elements for damage.
*   **Test Igniter:** For gas ovens, ensure the igniter glows and ignites gas.
*   **Verify Sensor/Thermostat:** Make sure the oven temperature sensor reads correctly.
*   **Examine Control Board:** Look for visible damage on the main control board.
*   **Ensure Door Seal:** A bad door seal can cause heat loss.

Your LG oven likely is not heating up due to a faulty heating element, a broken igniter (for gas models), a tripped circuit breaker, or a malfunctioning oven temperature sensor. Less common but possible issues include a defective control board or a safety thermostat trip.

## Understanding Your LG Oven's Heating System

Your LG oven uses a specific system to create and maintain heat. Knowing how it works helps you find the problem. Electric ovens and gas ovens have different components. Understanding these parts is key to troubleshooting why your LG oven is not heating up.

Electric ovens rely on heating elements. There is typically a bake element at the bottom and a broil element at the top. Electricity flows through these elements. This flow causes them to glow red and produce heat. A temperature sensor monitors the oven's internal heat. It sends information to the control board. The control board then cycles the elements on and off to maintain the set temperature. If any of these parts fail, your oven will not heat properly. For example, a broken element cannot generate heat. A faulty sensor might tell the control board the oven is hot when it is not. This prevents the elements from turning on. The control board itself can also fail, stopping all heating functions.

Gas ovens work differently. They use gas burners to create heat. When you turn on a gas oven, an igniter gets hot. This igniter lights the gas coming from the burner. A flame sensor then detects the flame. This sensor tells the gas valve to stay open. If the igniter does not get hot enough, the gas will not light. If the flame sensor does not detect a flame, the gas valve will close. This prevents gas leaks. Both the igniter and the flame sensor are crucial for a gas oven to heat. A faulty igniter is a common reason for a gas oven not heating up.

Both oven types have a main control board. This board is the "brain" of the oven. It receives commands from you and manages all heating functions. It controls when elements or igniters turn on and off. It also processes information from the temperature sensor. If the control board malfunctions, it cannot send the correct signals. This prevents the oven from heating. Safety features like thermal fuses also exist. These fuses cut power if the oven gets too hot. A tripped fuse means the oven will not get power to heat. Each part plays a vital role in the heating process.

## Checking Electrical Supply and Circuit Breakers

A basic check of your oven's electrical supply is the first step. This simple step can save you a lot of time. Sometimes, your LG oven is not heating up because it is not getting power. This might seem obvious, but it is easy to overlook. Always start here before looking at internal parts.

First, check the oven's power cord. Make sure it is fully plugged into the wall outlet. A loose plug can stop power flow. Next, look at your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or oven. It might be tripped. A tripped breaker usually sits halfway between "on" and "off." Flip it completely to the "off" position, then firmly flip it back to "on." This resets the breaker. If the breaker trips again immediately, you might have an electrical short. This needs a professional electrician. Do not try to fix a short yourself.

Test the outlet itself if the breaker is fine. You can plug another appliance into the same outlet. A small lamp or a hairdryer works well. If the other appliance does not turn on, the outlet has no power. This could mean a wiring problem behind the wall. In this case, you should call an electrician. If the other appliance works, your oven is getting power. The problem lies within the oven itself.

Sometimes, an LG oven might not turn on at all if it has a power issue. If your LG oven is completely dead, meaning no lights or display, this power check is essential. For more detailed troubleshooting on power-related issues, you might find this article helpful: [Why Is My LG Oven Not Turning On](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-oven-not-turning-on). This step helps rule out external power problems. It points you towards internal oven components if power is confirmed.

## Diagnosing Faulty Heating Elements

If your LG oven is electric and not heating up, a faulty heating element is a very common cause. Electric ovens use elements to generate heat. There are usually two main elements: the bake element and the broil element. The bake element is at the bottom, and the broil element is at the top. Both can fail.

First, visually inspect both elements. Open your oven door and look inside. A damaged element might show visible signs of failure. Look for breaks, blisters, or holes on the element's surface. If an element looks damaged, it likely needs replacement. A broken element cannot conduct electricity. This means it cannot produce heat. Sometimes, an element might look fine but still be faulty. You will need to test it with a multimeter.

To test an element, you must first unplug the oven from the wall. Safety is very important. Always disconnect power before touching internal components. Once unplugged, locate the terminal screws or nuts holding the element in place. Remove these, then gently pull the element out a little. You will see two wires connected to the back. Use a multimeter set to measure resistance (Ohms). Place one probe on each terminal of the element. A good heating element will show a resistance reading, usually between 10 and 50 ohms. If the multimeter shows an "open circuit" or infinite resistance (OL), the element is bad. It has an internal break.

If your electric oven is not heating up properly, it might be due to a partially failing element or other issues affecting its overall heating. This could result in slow heating or uneven temperatures.

## Troubleshooting a Malfunctioning Oven Igniter (Gas Ovens)

For LG gas ovens that are not heating up, a faulty igniter is often the primary suspect. Unlike electric elements, gas ovens rely on a small component to ignite the gas. The igniter's job is crucial. It must get hot enough to ignite the gas flowing into the burner. If it fails, your oven will not produce heat.

When you turn on your gas oven, listen and watch. You should hear a faint "hissing" sound as gas starts to flow. Then, look for the igniter. It is usually a thin, glowing rod located near the main burner. A healthy igniter will glow bright orange. If it glows, the gas should ignite shortly after. If it glows faintly, or not at all, it is likely weak or faulty. A weak igniter might not get hot enough to light the gas. This means the oven will not heat. The gas valve will stay closed as a safety measure.

To confirm an igniter issue, you need to test its resistance. First, ensure the oven is unplugged or the gas supply is off. Safety is paramount when working with gas appliances. Access the igniter. It might be under the oven floor or behind a panel. Disconnect the igniter wires. Use a multimeter set to measure resistance (ohms). Place one probe on each igniter terminal. A good igniter typically reads between 60 and 200 ohms. Check your oven's service manual for the exact specifications. If the reading is outside the specified range, or shows "open circuit" (OL), the igniter is bad. It needs replacement.

Replacing an igniter is a common repair for gas ovens. It usually involves removing a few screws and disconnecting wires. Make sure you get the exact replacement part for your LG model. A new igniter should glow brightly and reliably light the gas. If your oven still does not heat after replacing the igniter, the issue might be with the gas valve or the oven's control system. However, the igniter is the most common reason for a gas oven not heating.

## Addressing Oven Temperature Sensor and Thermostat Issues

If your LG oven is not heating up, or heating unevenly, the oven temperature sensor or thermostat could be the problem. These parts are vital for accurate temperature control. They tell the oven's control board how hot the oven is. The control board uses this information to maintain the set temperature. If the sensor or thermostat sends incorrect readings, the oven will not heat correctly or at all.

The oven temperature sensor is usually a small rod or probe inside the oven cavity. It is often located at the top rear corner. It measures the internal temperature. This sensor sends electrical resistance readings to the control board. The resistance changes with temperature. If the sensor is faulty, it might send a constant, low resistance reading. This would trick the control board into thinking the oven is already hot. As a result, the control board would not turn on the heating elements or igniter. The oven would remain cold.

You can test the oven temperature sensor with a multimeter. First, unplug the oven for safety. Locate the sensor. You might need to remove a rear access panel to get to its wire connections. Disconnect the sensor's wires. Set your multimeter to measure resistance (ohms). Touch the probes to the sensor's terminals. A good sensor will have a specific resistance reading at room temperature, often around 1000 to 1100 ohms (1k to 1.1k ohms). This value varies by model. Check your LG oven's service manual for the precise resistance specifications. If your reading is significantly different, or if it shows an open circuit (OL), the sensor is bad.

A thermal fuse is another component related to temperature. This is a safety device. It trips and cuts power to the oven if it detects dangerously high temperatures. If the thermal fuse blows, your LG oven will not heat up at all. It will likely not even turn on. Testing a thermal fuse involves checking for continuity with a multimeter. If there is no continuity, the fuse is blown and needs replacement. Remember, a blown thermal fuse usually indicates an underlying problem that caused the overheating. You should investigate why it blew. If your oven is not heating to the correct temperature, or heating unevenly, a faulty sensor could be the cause.

## Examining the Control Board and Relays

The control board is the "brain" of your LG oven. It manages all functions, including heating. If your LG oven is not heating up and other components seem fine, the issue could be with the main control board or its relays. This board contains electronic circuits that send power to the heating elements or igniter.

First, perform a visual inspection of the control board. Unplug the oven before doing this. Access the control board, usually located behind the oven's control panel. Look for any signs of damage. Burn marks, swollen capacitors, or discolored areas indicate a faulty board. If you see any of these, the board is likely bad. Electronic components can burn out due to power surges or old age. A damaged board cannot send the correct signals for heating.

The control board contains relays. Relays are small switches that turn power on and off to components like heating elements. If a relay for the bake or broil element is stuck open or burned out, that specific element will not receive power. You might hear a clicking sound when the oven tries to heat. This is usually the relays engaging. If you hear no clicks, or if the clicks do not lead to heating, a relay might be faulty. Testing individual relays on a control board is complex. It often requires specialized knowledge and tools. For this reason, if the board looks damaged or you suspect a relay issue, replacement of the entire control board is often the most practical solution.

Before replacing the control board, ensure you have ruled out all other possibilities. This part can be expensive. Replacing it should be a last resort after checking simpler components. A malfunctioning control board can manifest in various ways, not just heating issues. It might affect other functions like the display or oven lights. If your electric oven is heating up slowly, a faulty control board might contribute. The board could be sending intermittent power or incorrect signals. Learn more about slow heating issues in electric ovens here: [Why Is My Electric Oven Heating Up Slowly](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-electric-oven-heating-up-slowly). If all other checks fail, the control board is a strong candidate for why your LG oven is not heating up.

## Investigating Oven Door Latch and Seal Issues

While less common than element or igniter problems, issues with the oven door latch or seal can cause your LG oven not to heat up. Modern ovens have safety features built in. These features prevent the oven from heating if the door is not securely closed. This is particularly true during the self-cleaning cycle, which heats the oven to very high temperatures.

The oven door latch ensures the door stays shut during operation. It also activates a safety switch. This switch tells the control board that the door is closed. If the latch is faulty, it might not properly engage. This means the safety switch might not activate. The control board would then interpret this as an open door. As a safety measure, the oven will not start heating. You might notice the oven light staying on, or a "door open" error code displayed. Check the latch mechanism for any visible damage or obstructions. Make sure nothing prevents it from closing fully. Sometimes, simply adjusting the door hinges can help the door close more securely.

The oven door seal, also called the gasket, prevents heat from escaping. It is a rubber or braided material lining the oven door frame. Over time, this seal can wear out, crack, or become brittle. If the seal is damaged, hot air will leak out of the oven. This causes the oven to lose heat. While the heating elements or igniter might be working, the oven will struggle to reach and maintain the set temperature. It might feel like your LG oven is not heating up at all, or it heats very slowly.

To check the door seal, visually inspect it all around the oven opening. Look for gaps, tears, or stiffness. You can also perform a "paper test." Close the oven door on a piece of paper. If you can easily pull the paper out, the seal is not tight enough at that spot. Repeat this test around the entire door. Replacing a worn door seal is usually a simple DIY task. You can often just pull the old one off and press a new one into place. A good seal ensures heat stays inside, allowing your oven to reach its target temperature efficiently.

## Safety Precautions and Professional Help

Working with appliances, especially ovens, requires proper safety precautions. Before you begin any troubleshooting or repair, always prioritize your safety. Ignoring these steps can lead to electric shock, gas leaks, or injury. I cannot stress this enough: safety comes first.

Always disconnect power to the oven. For electric ovens, unplug the power cord from the wall outlet. If the cord is inaccessible, turn off the dedicated circuit breaker for the oven at your home's main electrical panel. For gas ovens, turn off the gas supply valve to the oven in addition to disconnecting electricity. The gas valve is usually located behind the oven. Ensure both gas and electricity are off before touching any internal components. Wear work gloves to protect your hands from sharp edges. Some oven parts can be delicate. Handle them with care to avoid further damage.

While many oven problems can be fixed with DIY efforts, some situations require professional help. If you are uncomfortable performing any repair, or if the issue seems beyond your skill level, call a qualified appliance technician. This is especially true for gas oven repairs, where a mistake can lead to dangerous gas leaks. If you suspect an electrical short or wiring problem, always contact a certified electrician. Do not try to fix complex electrical issues yourself. Professionals have the right tools, knowledge, and experience to diagnose and fix problems safely.

Sometimes, a repair might be too costly. If your LG oven is very old, or if multiple major components are failing, the cost of repair might exceed the cost of a new oven. A technician can help you weigh these options. Consider the age and overall condition of your oven. It is important to know when to call it quits and buy a new appliance. While general oven troubleshooting can be similar across brands, each brand has specific design features. For example, some GE ovens may have unique troubleshooting steps when they are not heating up. This can be complex.
