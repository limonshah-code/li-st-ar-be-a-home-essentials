*   **Inspect Filters:** Dirty filters restrict airflow and cause many issues.
*   **Look for Ice:** A frozen outdoor unit signals a defrost problem.
*   **Listen for Sounds:** Unusual noises can point to specific component failures.
*   **Call a Pro:** Major issues like refrigerant leaks or compressor failure need expert help.

An air source heat pump stops working due to common issues like power outages, tripped circuit breakers, thermostat errors, dirty air filters, or a frozen outdoor unit. More serious problems involve low refrigerant levels, fan motor failure, or compressor malfunctions, which often require professional repair.

## Power Problems: Checking Your Air Source Heat Pump's Electrical Supply

When your air source heat pump is not working, the first thing to check is its power supply. This might seem obvious, but electrical issues are a common cause of heat pump failures. Your heat pump needs a steady flow of electricity to operate. Without power, the unit simply cannot perform its job of heating or cooling your home.

Start by looking at your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker labeled for your heat pump. Sometimes, a power surge or a minor electrical fault can trip the breaker. This cuts off power to the unit. If the breaker is in the "off" position or in the middle (tripped), flip it completely to "off" and then firmly back to "on." This simple reset often restores power. If the breaker trips again immediately, a more serious electrical problem exists. Do not repeatedly reset a tripping breaker, as this can be dangerous.

Next, check any disconnect switches located near the outdoor unit of your heat pump. These are safety switches that allow power to be manually shut off for maintenance. Sometimes, these switches are accidentally flipped off. Ensure they are in the "on" position. Also, check the fuse box if your system uses fuses instead of breakers. A blown fuse will also cut power. If these basic checks do not resolve the issue, the problem might be more complex. This could involve wiring issues or internal electrical component failures. In such cases, contact a qualified HVAC technician.

## Thermostat Troubles: Is Your Heat Pump Getting the Right Commands?

A common reason your air source heat pump is not working involves the thermostat. The thermostat is your heat pump's brain. It tells the system when to turn on, when to turn off, and what temperature to maintain. If the thermostat is not sending correct signals, your heat pump will not respond properly, or it may not respond at all.

First, check the thermostat settings. Ensure it is set to "heat" or "cool" mode, depending on what you want. Confirm the temperature setting is below your current room temperature for heating or above for cooling. If your thermostat is programmable, check its schedule. It might be set to an "off" period or an incorrect temperature. Sometimes, simply adjusting the desired temperature by a few degrees can trigger the system. If your thermostat uses batteries, check them. Dead batteries are a very common and easy-to-fix issue. Replace them if needed.

Beyond settings and batteries, a faulty thermostat can also prevent your heat pump from working. The internal components or wiring of the thermostat can fail over time. You might notice a blank screen, erratic readings, or no response to button presses. If you suspect your thermostat is the problem, consider carefully checking its wiring connections. Make sure they are secure. You might also try resetting the thermostat if it has a reset button or procedure. This can sometimes resolve minor glitches. If the thermostat still does not work after these steps, it might need replacement. A new, compatible thermostat can often resolve communication issues with your heat pump.

## Airflow Blockages: When Your Air Source Heat Pump Can't Breathe

Restricted airflow is a major cause of an air source heat pump not working efficiently, or even failing completely. Your heat pump needs to move air freely to transfer heat. Both the indoor unit and the outdoor unit rely on unobstructed airflow. If airflow is blocked, the system struggles, leading to poor performance, increased energy consumption, and eventually, system shutdown.

The most common culprit for airflow restriction is a dirty air filter. The indoor air handler contains a filter that traps dust, dirt, and allergens. Over time, this filter becomes clogged. A clogged filter blocks air from passing through. This reduces the amount of air the heat pump can heat or cool. It also makes the fan work harder. You should check your air filter monthly and replace or clean it as needed, typically every 1-3 months. A clean filter ensures proper airflow and system efficiency.

The outdoor unit also needs clear space. Check around the outdoor unit for debris. Leaves, grass clippings, dirt, and even snow or ice can block the coils and fan. Clear away any obstructions from the sides and top of the unit. Ensure there is at least two feet of clear space around the entire unit. A blocked outdoor unit cannot effectively absorb or release heat. This severely impacts the heat pump's ability to operate. Sometimes, improper [placement of the air source heat pump outside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-an-air-source-heat-pump-have-to-be-outside) can contribute to repeated airflow issues due to nearby foliage or structures. Indoor vents and registers also need to be clear. Make sure no furniture, curtains, or rugs are blocking them. Blocked vents can disrupt the balance of air distribution. This creates pressure imbalances that can stress the system.

## Refrigerant Issues: The Invisible Problem Affecting Your Heat Pump

Refrigerant is the lifeblood of your air source heat pump. It is the chemical compound that absorbs and releases heat as it cycles through the system. If your air source heat pump is not working, especially if it is blowing air that is not hot or cold enough, a refrigerant issue is often to blame. Low refrigerant levels directly impact the heat pump's ability to transfer heat. This leads to reduced efficiency and eventual system failure.

The most common cause of low refrigerant is a leak in the system. Refrigerant circulates in a sealed loop. Any crack, loose connection, or damage to the coils can allow refrigerant to escape. Leaks are often small and difficult to detect without specialized equipment. Signs of a refrigerant leak include a hissing sound, ice buildup on the outdoor unit (which can also indicate other issues), or higher electricity bills due to the heat pump working harder. You might also notice a decrease in heating or cooling capacity. The air coming from your vents may feel only slightly warm or cool, not at the desired temperature.

Refrigerant levels should only be checked and recharged by a certified HVAC technician. This is because refrigerants are hazardous chemicals. They require specific tools and knowledge for safe handling. Adding refrigerant without fixing a leak is only a temporary solution. The refrigerant will simply leak out again. A technician will find and repair the leak, then properly recharge the system. This ensures your heat pump operates safely and efficiently. If your system seems to be struggling to maintain temperature, and other simple checks have failed, a refrigerant leak is a strong possibility.

## Motor and Compressor Failures: Key Components Stopping Your Heat Pump

When your air source heat pump is not working at all, or is making unusual noises but producing no heat or cool air, the problem could lie with its motor or compressor. These are critical mechanical components that enable the heat transfer process. If either of these fails, the entire system essentially shuts down.

The heat pump has two main fans: one in the indoor unit (blower fan) and one in the outdoor unit (condenser fan). The indoor blower fan circulates air through your home. If this fan motor fails, you will hear the unit attempting to turn on, but no air will come out of the vents. You might hear a humming sound from the air handler but no airflow. The outdoor fan motor helps dissipate or absorb heat through the outdoor coil. If this fan fails, the outdoor unit might overheat or freeze up because heat cannot be properly exchanged. You might notice the outdoor unit is not spinning, or it makes grinding noises. Fan motor issues can sometimes be due to a faulty capacitor, which is an electrical component that helps start the motor.

The compressor is the heart of the heat pump. It is located in the outdoor unit. Its job is to compress the refrigerant, increasing its temperature and pressure. This is a crucial step in the heat transfer cycle. A failing compressor often presents with loud grinding, rattling, or buzzing noises. Sometimes, it might just hum loudly and then shut off. If the compressor fails, the heat pump will not be able to move heat effectively. This results in no heating or cooling whatsoever. Compressor failures are serious and expensive to repair. They typically require professional replacement. These issues indicate significant mechanical wear or electrical problems within the core components of your air source heat pump.

## Icy Unit: Why Your Air Source Heat Pump Freezes Up and Stops Working

Discovering your outdoor air source heat pump unit covered in ice is a clear sign something is wrong. When your air source heat pump is not working and appears frozen, it means the unit cannot complete its defrost cycle properly. In colder temperatures, it is normal for a thin layer of frost to form on the outdoor coil as the unit extracts heat from the cold air. Heat pumps have an automatic defrost cycle to melt this frost. If this cycle fails, ice builds up. This blocks airflow and prevents the unit from heating your home.

Several factors can cause a heat pump to freeze up. One common reason is a malfunctioning defrost sensor or a faulty defrost board. These components detect ice buildup and activate the defrost cycle. If they are not working correctly, the unit will continue to run without initiating defrost, leading to excessive ice formation. Another cause is low refrigerant levels. If the system has insufficient refrigerant, the pressure drops, causing the coils to get colder than they should. This makes them more prone to freezing. You might notice the unit struggling to heat your home before the ice becomes visible.

External factors can also contribute to freezing. Extremely cold temperatures combined with high humidity can sometimes overwhelm the defrost system. However, continuous icing usually points to an internal fault. Restricted airflow due to a dirty air filter or debris around the outdoor unit can also make freezing worse. The lack of air movement across the coil prevents effective heat exchange and defrosting. If your heat pump is frequently freezing, it is not just an inconvenience. It indicates an underlying problem that needs professional attention. You can learn more about specific causes and solutions for this problem by reading [why your air source heat pump freezes up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-air-source-heat-pump-freeze-up). Ignoring a freezing issue can lead to serious damage to the compressor and other vital components.

## Condensate Drain Woes: Water Problems Shutting Down Your Heat Pump

An often-overlooked reason for your air source heat pump not working is a clogged condensate drain line. Heat pumps remove moisture from the air during the heating and cooling process. This moisture collects as condensation in a drip pan, and then drains away through a condensate line. If this line becomes blocked, water backs up. This can trigger safety switches that shut down the heat pump to prevent water damage.

The condensate line can get clogged by algae, mold, dust, or debris. Over time, these substances accumulate and form a blockage. When the line is blocked, the water has nowhere to go. It overflows the drip pan. Many heat pumps have a float switch in the drip pan. This switch detects high water levels. If the water level rises too much, the float switch trips. This sends a signal to the heat pump to turn off immediately. This safety feature protects your home from water leaks and prevents damage to the heat pump's electrical components.

You might notice water pooling around the indoor unit or a musty odor if the condensate line is clogged. If your heat pump suddenly stops working and you see water, check the drain pan. You can often clear a minor clog yourself. Use a wet/dry vacuum to suction out the clog from the end of the drain line. You can also carefully pour a cup of distilled vinegar mixed with water into the drain line access point to kill algae and flush out blockages. Regular maintenance should include checking and cleaning the condensate drain line. This simple step can prevent many frustrating heat pump shutdowns.

## Preventative Measures: Regular Maintenance for a Reliable Heat Pump System

Many issues causing an air source heat pump not working stem from a lack of regular maintenance. Just like your car, your heat pump needs routine check-ups and care to perform optimally. Neglecting maintenance can lead to a build-up of small problems that eventually cause a complete system breakdown. Investing in preventative maintenance saves you money in the long run. It prevents costly repairs and ensures consistent home comfort.

One of the easiest and most important maintenance tasks is regularly changing or cleaning your air filters. As discussed, a dirty filter restricts airflow, forcing your heat pump to work harder. This increases energy consumption and puts strain on components, leading to premature wear. You should also keep the outdoor unit clean and free of debris. Trim back any vegetation that might grow too close. Ensure nothing blocks the unit's airflow. Use a garden hose to gently rinse off the outdoor coils to remove dirt and grime. This helps the unit dissipate or absorb heat more efficiently.

Beyond these simple homeowner tasks, professional maintenance is crucial. A certified HVAC technician performs a thorough inspection and tune-up. They check refrigerant levels, electrical connections, motor bearings, and condensate drains. They also clean coils and ensure all components operate within specifications. These checks identify potential problems before they become major failures. Regular servicing also helps extend the lifespan of your air source heat pump. Knowing [how often an air source heat pump should be serviced](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-an-air-source-heat-pump-be-serviced) is key to preventing unexpected breakdowns. Professional maintenance ensures your system runs efficiently and reliably, minimizing the chances of it unexpectedly stopping.
