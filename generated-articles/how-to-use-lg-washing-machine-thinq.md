### Connecting Your LG Washing Machine to ThinQ

Connecting your LG washing machine to the ThinQ app is the first step. This process allows your phone to talk to your washer. I remember the first time I set mine up; it felt like magic. Having a stable Wi-Fi connection is important for this process.

First, download the LG ThinQ app from your phone's app store. You can find it on both Android and iOS devices. After installing, open the app and create an account. You need an LG account to register your appliances. If you have an existing account, simply log in. This step secures your smart home device access.

Next, add your washing machine to the app. Tap the '+' icon to add a new device. The app guides you through choosing your appliance type. Select "Washer" from the list. Your washing machine needs to be in pairing mode. Most LG models require you to press and hold the Wi-Fi button on the washer's control panel for three seconds. The Wi-Fi indicator light will blink.

The app will then search for your washing machine. Make sure your phone is close to the washer
