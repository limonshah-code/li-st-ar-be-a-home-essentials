### Why Does My Maytag Washing Machine Shake?

Your Maytag washing machine shakes mostly due to an unbalanced load of laundry or an unlevel machine. Other causes include removed shipping bolts, worn internal parts like shock absorbers or suspension rods, or problems with the motor and tub bearings. Resolving these issues often involves simple adjustments or part replacements.

## Unbalanced Loads: The Primary Shaking Culprit

An unbalanced laundry load is the most common reason your Maytag washing machine shakes. Clothes clump together during the wash or spin cycle. This creates an uneven weight distribution inside the drum. The machine tries to spin this lopsided weight, leading to severe vibration and shaking.

Heavy items like blankets, jeans, or towels are often the culprits. They absorb a lot of water and can settle on one side of the tub. This throws off the machine's balance. Modern Maytag washers have sensors to detect this. They may try to redistribute the load or add more water. If this fails, the spin cycle will still be very shaky.

To fix an unbalanced load, pause your Maytag washing machine. Open the lid or door. Redistribute the items evenly around the drum. Close the door and resume the cycle. Sometimes, removing one or two very heavy items helps. You can wash them separately later.

Preventing unbalanced loads starts with proper loading. Mix large, heavy items with smaller, lighter ones. Avoid overloading the machine. An overloaded washer struggles to distribute weight properly. This leads to more shaking and strain on components. You should also be aware that excessive noise often accompanies shaking. If you find your Maytag washing machine is also [so loud during operation](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-maytag-washing-machine-so-loud), an unbalanced load is a likely cause. Addressing the load imbalance often reduces both shaking and noise.

## Leveling Issues: Ensuring a Stable Foundation

A Maytag washing machine needs a perfectly level surface to operate smoothly. If the machine is not level, it will rock back and forth, especially during high-speed spin cycles. This rocking motion quickly escalates into significant shaking. An unlevel washer puts undue stress on its internal components.

I recommend checking your Maytag washing machine's stability. Gently push on each corner of the machine. If it rocks, it is not level. You need to adjust the leveling feet at the bottom of the washer. Most Maytag models have four adjustable feet. They typically screw in or out to change the height.

To adjust, slightly tilt the washer to access the feet. Turn the feet clockwise to lower a corner or counter-clockwise to raise it. Use a spirit level on top of the machine to ensure accuracy. Adjust until the machine sits firmly on all four feet without rocking. Make sure to lock the feet in place if your model has lock nuts. This prevents them from moving during operation.

The floor beneath your washing machine also plays a role. A weak or uneven floor can contribute to shaking. If your laundry room floor is bouncy or sloped, it can worsen vibration. Consider reinforcing the floor if this is the case. You can also place a thick rubber anti-vibration mat under the washer. This mat absorbs some of the movement. It helps dampen vibrations and noise.

## Shipping Bolts: The Often Overlooked Detail

Many new Maytag washing machines come with shipping bolts. These bolts secure the washer tub during transit. They prevent the tub from moving excessively and damaging internal parts. It is crucial to remove these bolts before operating your new Maytag washing machine. Failing to do so is a common mistake.

If you leave the shipping bolts in, the tub cannot float freely as it should. When the machine starts to fill with water and spin, the tub tries to move. The shipping bolts restrict this movement. This causes violent shaking, banging, and loud noises. The machine essentially fights against itself. This can cause severe damage to the machine's suspension system or even its frame.

I recommend checking your Maytag owner's manual for specific instructions. The manual will show where the shipping bolts are located. They are usually at the back of the machine. They look like large bolts or screws, often with plastic spacers. Use a wrench or pliers to remove them. Keep these bolts in a safe place. You might need them if you move the washing machine in the future.

If you just bought a new Maytag washer, this is the first thing to check if it shakes right away. This simple step solves many shaking issues for new machines. Understanding how to [properly use your new Maytag washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-new-maytag-washing-machine) from the start, including removing shipping bolts, prevents many early problems. This step ensures a smooth, quiet operation from day one.

## Worn or Damaged Components: Mechanical Failures

Even perfectly loaded and level Maytag washing machines can shake if internal components wear out. Over time, parts designed to absorb vibrations can degrade. These mechanical failures require part replacement to restore smooth operation. Identifying the specific worn part is key to a lasting repair.

Here are the common internal components that cause shaking:

### Shock Absorbers or Suspension Rods

Most washing machines use shock absorbers or suspension rods to support the tub. These parts cushion the tub's movement during spin cycles. They prevent the tub from hitting the machine's frame. Over years of use, these components can weaken or break. When they fail, the tub loses its dampening system. This leads to excessive shaking and banging noises.

For top-load washers, you typically find suspension rods. They are long, thin rods that connect the tub to the top frame of the washer. Front-load washers often use shock absorbers. These look like car shock absorbers and attach to the bottom of the tub and base frame. If one or more are worn, the tub becomes unstable. You can inspect them by tilting or opening the washer. Look for signs of oil leaks, rust, or damage. Replacing these parts often resolves severe shaking.

### Tub Bearings

The tub bearings allow the inner wash drum to spin smoothly within the outer tub. If these bearings wear out, the drum will wobble and grind. This causes significant shaking and a very loud, often grinding noise during spin cycles. Bad tub bearings are a more complex repair. They often require extensive disassembly of the washing machine.

I suggest listening carefully for the type of noise your Maytag washing machine makes. A constant grinding or roaring sound that gets louder during spin is a strong indicator of bad tub bearings. Replacing tub bearings often requires removing the entire wash drum assembly. You can learn how to [remove your Maytag washing machine drum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-maytag-washing-machine-drum) if you plan to tackle this yourself. This is a challenging task for most homeowners and may require professional help.

### Drive Belt

Some Maytag washing machines use a drive belt to transfer power from the motor to the wash drum. If this belt becomes worn, stretched, or broken, it can cause the drum to spin unevenly or inefficiently. This uneven spinning can lead to vibration and shaking. A worn belt might also slip, making a squealing noise.

I recommend checking the drive belt if other common issues are ruled out. Accessing the drive belt usually involves removing the back panel or lower front panel of the washing machine. Look for cracks, fraying, or looseness in the belt. If the belt looks damaged, you will need to replace it. Learning [how to replace a Maytag washing machine belt](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-maytag-washing-machine-belt) is a valuable skill for DIYers, as it can prevent many spin cycle issues. A new belt ensures smooth power transfer to the drum.

### Motor Mounts

The motor within your Maytag washing machine is typically secured by rubber motor mounts. These mounts absorb vibrations from the motor. They also keep the motor stable. If these mounts degrade, crack, or become loose, the motor itself can vibrate excessively. This vibration then transfers to the entire washing machine, causing it to shake.

Checking motor mounts usually requires a bit more effort. You may need to access the motor compartment. Look for any visible damage to the rubber mounts. Ensure they are securely fastened. If they are worn, replacing them can help stabilize the motor. This reduces overall machine vibration.

## Drain Pump Issues and Clogged Filters

While not always a direct cause of shaking, issues with your Maytag washing machine's drainage system can indirectly lead to vibration. If the machine cannot drain water properly, the clothes remain soaked. This adds significant weight to the load. An overly wet, heavy load can easily become unbalanced. This causes the washer to shake violently during the spin cycle.

A clogged drain pump or a dirty pump filter can restrict water flow. Lint, small items, or debris can accumulate in these areas. When the machine attempts to spin out water, it cannot complete the task efficiently. The tub might retain too much water, making the load heavier than normal. This extra, uneven weight leads to shaking.

I advise checking your Maytag washing machine's drainage if shaking occurs with very wet clothes. First, confirm that your washer is draining properly. If you find that [your Maytag washing machine won't drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-maytag-washing-machine-drain), a clogged pump or filter is a strong possibility. Many models have an accessible drain pump filter. This is usually behind a small panel at the bottom front of the machine. Unscrew the cap slowly, as water might come out. Clean any lint or debris you find.

Regular cleaning of this filter is a good maintenance practice. It helps prevent drainage issues before they start. A clear drainage system ensures the machine can properly extract water. This helps maintain load balance during the spin cycle. This reduces the chances of your Maytag washing machine shaking.

## Washer Feet and Floor Condition

The stability of your Maytag washing machine directly depends on its feet and the floor it sits on. Uneven or damaged washer feet prevent proper leveling. A weak or excessively flexible floor surface can amplify vibrations. Both factors contribute to the notorious washing machine shake.

Maytag washing machines come with adjustable leveling feet. These feet allow you to raise or lower each corner. This ensures the machine sits perfectly level. If one or more feet are missing, damaged, or stuck, you cannot achieve proper balance. A missing rubber pad on a foot can also cause instability. I suggest inspecting all four feet. Ensure they are intact and firmly make contact with the floor. Replace any damaged feet.

The floor's condition is equally important. Hard, solid floors like concrete are ideal. They provide a stable base that absorbs minimal vibration. Wooden floors, especially on upper levels, can flex or bounce. This movement gets amplified by the spinning washer. If your floor causes issues, consider placing a sturdy plywood board under the machine. This helps distribute the weight evenly. An anti-vibration mat made of heavy-duty rubber can also help. This mat sits under the entire washer. It significantly dampens vibrations before they reach the floor.

Ensuring your Maytag washing machine is both level and on a stable surface is foundational. It provides the best environment for smooth operation.
