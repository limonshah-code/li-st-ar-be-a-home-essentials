## Styles and Designs of Rooms To Go Area Rugs

Rooms To Go offers a broad range of area rug styles. They cater to many interior design preferences. You will find contemporary designs that feature clean lines and abstract patterns. These rugs often use neutral colors or bold geometric shapes. They fit well in modern homes.

For those who like classic decor, traditional rugs are available. These rugs often have intricate patterns. They might feature medallion motifs or floral designs. Traditional rugs bring a timeless elegance to a room. They often come in rich, deep colors.

Beyond these main categories, you can discover other styles. Transitional rugs offer a blend of old and new elements. They combine traditional comfort with modern simplicity.

They are perfect for bedrooms or casual living areas.

The design of a rug impacts a room's mood. A light-colored rug can make a small room seem larger. A dark, patterned rug can add drama and sophistication. [Do rugs make rooms warmer?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-rugs-make-rooms-warmer) Yes, they do. Beyond aesthetics, rugs also add insulation. They help keep your floors warmer, especially in colder months. This can make a room more comfortable.

## Sizes and Shapes: Fitting a Rooms To Go Rug to Your Space

Choosing the correct rug size is crucial for any room. A rug that is too small can make a room feel disjointed. A rug that is too large can overwhelm the space. Rooms To Go offers area rugs in many standard sizes. This helps you find the right fit for your home.

Common rectangular sizes include 5x7 feet, 8x10 feet, and 9x12 feet. These sizes work well for most living rooms, dining rooms, and bedrooms. Runners are also available. These long, narrow rugs are perfect for hallways or entryways. They protect floors and add visual interest. Some round rugs are also part of their collection. Round rugs create a soft, inviting look. They work well under round dining tables or in entryways.

Consider the layout of your furniture. In a living room, a rug should extend under the front legs of major furniture pieces. This creates a unified look. For a dining room, the rug should be large enough. Chair legs should remain on the rug even when pulled out from the table. For a bedroom, a large rug can go under the entire bed. Smaller rugs work well on either side of the bed.

### Living Room Rug Placement

In a living room, aim for balance. Place the rug so it anchors your seating area. All front legs of your sofa and chairs should sit on the rug. This helps create a defined conversation space. This makes the room feel more complete and cozy.

### Bedroom Rug Guidelines

For bedrooms, you have options. A large rug under the entire bed is common. It adds warmth and softness underfoot. Alternatively, you can use two smaller runners. Place one on each side of the bed. This provides comfort right where you step out of bed.

### Dining Area Rug Considerations

Dining room rugs need to be functional. Make sure the rug extends at least 24 inches beyond the dining table on all sides. This ensures chairs stay on the rug when someone pulls them out. It protects your floors from scratches. [Should area rugs in adjoining rooms match?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/should-area-rugs-in-adjoining-rooms-match) Not necessarily. Rugs in adjoining rooms can complement each other. They do not need to be exact matches. Consider color families or similar textures.

## Materials and Durability: Understanding Rooms To Go Rug Quality

The material of an area rug determines its look, feel, and durability. Rooms To Go offers rugs made from various materials. Each material has unique properties. Understanding these helps you choose the best rug for your needs.

Many Rooms To Go rugs are made from synthetic fibers. Polypropylene, also known as olefin, is a popular choice. It is durable, stain-resistant, and fade-resistant. This makes it ideal for high-traffic areas. Nylon is another strong synthetic fiber. It handles heavy foot traffic well and resists crushing. These synthetic options are often budget-friendly. They provide good performance.

Some rugs may feature natural fibers. Cotton rugs are soft and breathable. They work well in casual settings. Jute rugs offer a natural, textured look. They bring an organic feel to a room. However, natural fibers might be less stain-resistant than synthetics. They often require specific cleaning methods.

Consider where the rug will go. A high-traffic living room needs a durable rug. A cozy bedroom can use a softer, less resilient material. The material affects how long your rug lasts. It also impacts how easy it is to keep clean. [How to clean wash area rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-wash-area-rugs) is an important skill. Regular vacuuming helps. Spot cleaning spills quickly is also crucial. Different materials need different cleaning approaches.

## Shopping for Area Rugs at Rooms To Go: Online vs. In-Store

Rooms To Go makes shopping convenient for customers. You can explore their area rug collection in two main ways. Both online and in-store options have their benefits. My experience tells me that each method offers a unique advantage.

Shopping for rugs online provides a vast selection. You can browse hundreds of rugs from your home. The Rooms To Go website allows you to filter by size, color, style, and material. This makes finding specific rugs easier. You can compare different options side by side. Online descriptions and photos give you a good idea of each rug. Customer reviews can also provide helpful insights. It is a good way to see their entire inventory.

Visiting a physical Rooms To Go store offers a different experience. In-store, you can see the rugs up close. You can touch the materials and feel the textures. This is important for rugs. Colors can look different on a screen than in person. Seeing a rug in a showroom allows you to judge its true shade. You can also visualize it in a room setting. Sales associates are available to answer questions. They can offer advice on coordinating rugs with furniture.

Both methods have value. I often start my search online to narrow down choices. Then, I visit a store to confirm my top picks. This combined approach works well. It ensures you make an informed decision.

## Pricing and Value: Investing in Rooms To Go Area Rugs

When you shop for area rugs at Rooms To Go, you will find a range of price points. This variety allows different budgets to find suitable options. Rooms To Go aims to provide good value to its customers. They offer stylish rugs at competitive prices.

The cost of a rug depends on several factors. The size of the rug plays a major role. Larger rugs naturally cost more than smaller ones. The material also impacts pricing. Synthetic rugs, like those made from polypropylene, tend to be more affordable. Natural fiber rugs, such as wool, might have a higher price tag. The complexity of the design and the manufacturing process also affect cost. Intricate patterns or hand-tufted rugs typically cost more.

Rooms To Go sometimes offers promotions. They might have sales on specific rug collections. Sometimes, rugs are part of furniture packages. Buying a rug as part of a complete room set can offer savings. This provides good value if you need multiple items. Financing options are often available too. These plans help customers manage larger purchases.

Consider the long-term value. A well-chosen rug can last many years. It enhances your home's appearance. It also protects your floors. For those looking to update their home without a full renovation, a new rug is a smart investment. If you are looking to replace an old rug, consider what you can do with your current one.

## Integrating Rooms To Go Rugs with Your Home Decor

Adding an area rug from Rooms To Go is an effective way to enhance your home decor. A rug does more than cover a floor. It defines zones, adds color, and ties a room together. My advice is to think of your rug as a foundation piece.

Consider the existing colors in your room. Your rug can either complement or contrast these colors. A neutral rug provides a calming backdrop. A rug with bold colors or patterns can become a focal point. It can introduce new hues to your palette. Make sure the rug's style matches your furniture. A modern rug works best with modern furniture. A traditional rug fits well with classic pieces.

Rugs are excellent for creating visual interest. You can choose a rug with a texture that adds depth to the room. For example, a shag rug creates softness. A flat-weave rug offers a crisp look. Layering rugs is another popular design technique. You can place a smaller, decorative rug over a larger, neutral one. This adds warmth and a luxurious feel. [Can you put area rugs over carpet?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-area-rugs-over-carpet) Yes, you can. It helps define spaces. It also adds texture and color to a carpeted room.

### Complementing Existing Furniture

Your rug should work with your furniture. If your sofa is a solid color, a patterned rug can add excitement. If your furniture has busy patterns, a solid or subtly textured rug might be better. The rug should unite the elements in your room.

### Creating Visual Interest

Don't be afraid to use your rug to make a statement. A unique design or unexpected color can draw attention. It makes your room feel more personalized. The rug can serve as a piece of art for your floor.

### Defining Spaces

In open-concept homes, rugs are invaluable. They help delineate different areas. A rug under your dining table clearly marks the dining zone. A rug in the living area establishes a cozy conversation space. This provides structure in large rooms.
