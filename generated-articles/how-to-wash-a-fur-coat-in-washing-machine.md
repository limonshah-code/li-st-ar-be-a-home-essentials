## Wash Your Fur Coat in the Washing Machine: Our Guide

Many people own a beautiful fur coat. Cleaning it often feels daunting. You might wonder if your washing machine can handle this task. Good news: for *faux* fur, the answer is frequently yes. This guide will teach you how to properly wash a fur coat in a washing machine. I will share simple steps to keep your fur coat looking great. We cover everything from identifying your fur type to drying and storing your coat. You will learn the best methods to wash your fur coat at home.

### Takeaway

*   Always check the care label before washing any fur coat.
*   Machine washing is generally suitable only for faux fur, not real fur.
*   Use cold water and a delicate cycle with a mild detergent.
*   Protect your fur coat by placing it in a mesh laundry bag.
*   Always air dry your fur coat, avoiding direct heat.
*   Brush your fur coat gently after drying to restore its fluffiness.

You can safely wash a faux fur coat in a washing machine using cold water and a delicate cycle. Place the coat in a mesh bag with a mild detergent. Avoid hot water and machine drying. Air dry the coat, then brush it to maintain its softness and shape.

## Real Fur vs. Faux Fur: Knowing Your Coat's Fabric

Before you consider machine washing your fur coat, you must understand its material. This distinction is the most important step. It tells you if machine washing is even an option. You must know if your coat is made of real fur or faux fur.

Real fur comes from animals. It has a leather hide backing. This natural material reacts poorly to water, especially machine washing. Getting real fur wet can cause the hide to stiffen, crack, and dry out. It can also lead to excessive shedding and an unpleasant odor. Real fur items always need professional cleaning. Do not attempt to wash real fur in your washing machine.

Faux fur, on the other hand, is synthetic. It is made from acrylic, polyester, or other manufactured fibers. These materials are designed to imitate the look and feel of real fur. Faux fur is much more resilient to water. Most faux fur coats can handle a gentle machine wash. However, you must always check the care label first. This label provides specific instructions for your coat's fabric. Skipping this step can lead to damage. Make sure you know what your coat is made of before proceeding.

## Preparing Your Fur Coat for Machine Washing

Proper preparation is essential for a successful machine wash. Taking a few moments before washing protects your coat. It also ensures a thorough cleaning. I always start by checking the care label. This label has specific washing instructions from the manufacturer. It will tell you if machine washing is safe for your particular coat.

Next, you need to empty all pockets. Items left in pockets can damage the coat or the washing machine. Give your fur coat a good shake outdoors. This helps remove loose dirt, dust, and debris. A lint roller can also help pick up surface lint or pet hair. Gently remove any visible stains before washing. You can do this with a damp cloth and a small amount of mild detergent. Dab the stain carefully, do not rub aggressively.

Turn your fur coat inside out before placing it in the washing machine. This protects the outer fur from too much friction during the wash cycle. Put the coat inside a large mesh laundry bag. This bag acts as a protective barrier. It prevents snagging, stretching, and tangling of the fur. The mesh bag also helps maintain the coat's shape. Think of it as a gentle cocoon for your delicate item. Proper preparation makes a big difference in the outcome. Preparing other delicate coats also needs special attention, much like when you [clean a suede coat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-suede-coat).

## Choosing the Right Detergent and Water Temperature

Selecting the correct detergent and water temperature is very important. These choices directly affect the safety and effectiveness of washing your fur coat. Using the wrong products can cause irreversible damage. I always recommend a mild, gentle liquid detergent. Look for detergents designed for delicates or wool. These products are free of harsh chemicals and enzymes. They clean effectively without stripping the fur's softness.

Avoid using powdered detergents. Powder can leave a residue on the fur fibers. This residue might make your coat feel stiff or look dull. Never use bleach or fabric softeners when washing a fur coat. Bleach is too harsh for synthetic fibers and can discolor the fur. Fabric softeners can leave a waxy coating. This coating can clump the fur and reduce its fluffiness. A gentle liquid detergent is all you need for a clean, soft result.

Cold water is absolutely essential for washing faux fur. Hot water is a major enemy of synthetic fibers. It can cause the fur to melt, mat, or permanently lose its texture. Hot water can also damage the coat's backing material. Always set your washing machine to a cold water wash cycle. This preserves the integrity of the faux fur. Cold water cleans effectively without risking heat damage. Understanding the impact of different water temperatures, such as when you use a [hot wash in your washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-hot-wash-in-washing-machine) for other items, helps you appreciate why cold water is critical for fur.

## Selecting the Correct Washing Machine Settings

The right washing machine settings are crucial for a successful wash. These settings protect your fur coat from harsh treatment. They ensure a gentle, effective cleaning process. I always choose the delicate or gentle cycle on my washing machine. This cycle uses slower agitation and lower spin speeds. It mimics hand washing, which is ideal for sensitive fabrics. An aggressive cycle can stretch, tear, or mat the fur.

A low spin speed is also important. High spin speeds remove more water, but they can stress the fur. They can cause tangling and damage to the fibers. A low spin helps the coat shed some water without excessive force. It keeps the fur intact and minimizes wrinkling. Make sure your washing machine is not overloaded. Overloading the machine means there is not enough room for proper agitation. This can prevent the coat from cleaning properly. It can also cause friction between items, leading to damage.

Wash your fur coat alone or with one or two similar, lightweight items. This prevents overcrowding the machine. It gives your coat ample space to move freely. Understanding how much to load your washing machine, as discussed in [how full a washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be), applies here. This attention to detail will keep your fur coat looking its best.

## The Washing Process: Gentle Care is Key

Once you have prepared your fur coat and selected the right settings, you can begin the wash. This part is straightforward but still needs attention. It's important to ensure everything is set correctly before pressing start. I make sure my faux fur coat is inside its mesh laundry bag. This protects the fur throughout the cycle. The mesh bag prevents the fibers from getting caught or pulled.

Place the mesh bag with your fur coat into the washing machine drum. Add the mild liquid detergent to the dispenser. Avoid adding too much detergent, as excess can be hard to rinse out. Close the washing machine door securely. Double-check that you have selected the delicate cycle and cold water setting. These steps are vital for gentle cleaning.

Now, you can start the washing machine. Allow the cycle to complete without interruption. Do not open the machine during the wash. The gentle agitation will clean the coat effectively. Once the cycle finishes, promptly remove the fur coat from the machine. Do not let it sit in the damp machine. Leaving it wet can lead to mildew or odors. Quickly move it to the drying stage. This quick action helps prevent any issues after washing.

## Air Drying Your Fur Coat for Best Results

Drying your fur coat properly is just as important as washing it correctly. This step prevents damage and helps maintain the coat's texture. Never use a machine dryer for your faux fur coat. High heat is the enemy of synthetic fur. It can melt the fibers, causing them to clump, mat, or become permanently damaged. This will ruin the coat's soft, fluffy appearance.

After removing your coat from the washing machine, gently squeeze out any excess water. Do not wring or twist the coat harshly. This can stretch or damage the fabric. Lay the coat flat on a clean, dry towel. Roll the towel up with the coat inside and press gently. This helps absorb more moisture. Then, hang your fur coat on a sturdy, padded hanger. Avoid wire hangers, as they can misshape the shoulders.

Hang the coat in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Direct heat can still cause damage, even from the sun. Air circulation helps the coat dry evenly and quickly. Drying time can vary depending on the coat's thickness and humidity levels. It might take 24 to 48 hours for it to dry completely. Ensure the coat is fully dry before moving to the next step. This thorough drying process is similar to how you would air dry other delicate items, even when learning [how to clean fur shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-fur-shoes). Patience in this stage pays off for a beautifully restored coat.

## Restoring Fluffiness: Brushing and Finishing Touches

Once your fur coat is completely dry, it might look a little flat or clumpy. This is normal after washing. The next step is to restore its natural fluffiness and shine. This is one of my favorite parts of the cleaning process. It brings the coat back to life. I use a soft-bristled brush or a pet slicker brush. These brushes are gentle enough for faux fur.

Start by gently brushing the fur in the direction of the nap. The nap refers to the natural direction the fur fibers lie. Brushing against the nap can cause damage. Work in small sections, detangling any matted areas carefully. Do not pull or tug aggressively on the fur. Gentle strokes will help separate the fibers. This returns the coat to its original soft and fluffy state.

Continue brushing until the entire coat looks uniform and feels soft. You might be surprised at how much difference this step makes. It restores the coat's volume and luxurious texture. After brushing, give the coat another gentle shake. This helps the fur settle and look its best. These finishing touches are simple but very effective. They ensure your machine-washed fur coat looks as good as new. The care taken here is much like the attention given to synthetic fur on other items, for example, when cleaning [Crocs with fur](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-crocs-with-fur).

## When Professional Cleaning is Your Only Option

While machine washing is a great option for many faux fur coats, it is not always the best choice. There are specific situations where professional cleaning is necessary. Understanding these limits protects your coat from irreversible damage. Knowing when to seek expert help is important for proper care.

First and foremost, real fur coats always require professional cleaning. As I mentioned earlier, water can severely damage the leather hide of real fur. Professional furriers use specialized dry-cleaning methods. These methods preserve the natural oils and structure of the fur. Attempting to machine wash real fur will likely ruin it.

Heavily soiled fur coats, especially with grease or oil stains, should also go to a professional. Machine washing might not effectively remove deep-set stains. It could even spread them further. Very old or delicate faux fur coats may also be too fragile for a washing machine. Their fibers might be weaker or more prone to shedding. Coats with embellishments like beads, sequins, or delicate linings are another case for professional care. These details can get damaged or detach during a machine wash.

When in doubt, always consult a professional cleaner specializing in fur. They have the expertise and equipment to clean delicate items safely. This includes other challenging materials like when you consider [washing a leather coat in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-a-leather-coat-in-the-washing-machine). Professional cleaning ensures your cherished coat receives the best possible care.
