## How To Make A Wool Felt Penny Rug

Have you ever thought about making something truly special for your home? A handmade wool felt penny rug adds warmth and character to any room. It is a traditional craft with a charming, rustic appeal. This project lets you use your creativity to design a unique piece of textile art.

I am excited to guide you through each step of this rewarding process. We will cover everything from gathering your materials to the final stitches. You will learn about selecting the right felt, designing your pattern, and the best way to assemble your rug. By the end, you will have a beautiful, personalized wool felt penny rug to display.

### Takeaway

*   Gather essential wool felt, base fabric, and sewing supplies.
*   Plan your penny rug design with various felt circle sizes and colors.
*   Cut felt circles precisely using templates for consistency.
*   Stitch each felt "penny" onto the base fabric using simple applique methods.
*   Finish your rug by binding the edges and adding a backing if desired.
*   Care for your handmade rug with gentle cleaning to ensure its longevity.

To make a wool felt penny rug, gather wool felt, a sturdy base fabric, sharp scissors, a needle, and thread. Cut felt into various sized circles, then arrange and overlap them onto the base. Hand-stitch each felt "penny" firmly into place using a simple applique stitch. This traditional craft creates a charming, durable decorative piece for your home.

### 1. Gathering Your Penny Rug Making Supplies

Starting any craft project requires having the right tools and materials. For a wool felt penny rug, this means selecting quality items. The choices you make now impact the final look and durability of your rug. I always recommend getting the best materials you can find.

#### Choosing Your Wool Felt

Wool felt is the star of your penny rug. It is a natural fiber known for its strength and rich texture. True wool felt does not fray when cut, which makes it perfect for this project. You can find wool felt in many colors, allowing for endless design possibilities. This material holds its shape well and provides a lovely soft feel.

When considering materials for your home, understanding the properties of wool is helpful. For example, [understanding wool carpet costs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-is-wool-carpet) can give you insight into why pure wool felt might be a bit more expensive than synthetic options, but it offers superior quality and longevity. You will need several colors of wool felt for your "pennies." It is also good to have a piece of sturdy wool fabric for the rug's base. This base will hold all your felt circles securely.

#### Essential Tools You Will Need

Having the right tools makes the crafting process much smoother. You do not need many specialized items for making a penny rug. Most of these tools you might already have at home. Good quality tools make a big difference in the ease and enjoyment of your project.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Sharp Fabric Scissors:** These are crucial for clean, precise cuts on your felt. Dull scissors can make edges uneven.
*   **Needles:** Embroidery or general hand-sewing needles work well. Choose one with an eye large enough for your thread.
*   **Embroidery Floss or Strong Thread:** I prefer embroidery floss for its color variety and strength. Choose colors that match or contrast with your felt.
*   **Fabric Pencil or Chalk:** Use this for tracing your circles onto the felt. It marks clearly without leaving permanent stains.
*   **Circle Templates:** Various sizes of circles are key. You can use lids, coins, or plastic templates.
*   **Pins:** These hold your felt pieces in place before you stitch them down. Straight pins work best for felt.
*   **Thimble:** This protects your finger as you push the needle through layers of felt. It is a small but mighty helper.

Gathering these items before you start helps you stay organized. It also allows you to dive straight into the fun part of designing and stitching.

### 2. Designing Your Wool Felt Penny Rug Layout

Designing your rug is where your creativity truly shines. This step is about planning the arrangement of your felt circles. Think about colors, sizes, and how they will overlap to create a pleasing pattern. I enjoy this part because it is like painting a picture with fabric.

#### Simple Design Ideas

Penny rugs often feature overlapping circles that resemble old coins, hence the "penny" name. You can create a simple, traditional design by arranging circles in neat rows. Overlap each circle slightly with its neighbors. This creates a textured, layered look. You can also vary the sizes of the circles to add interest.

Consider using a central large circle and then surrounding it with smaller ones. Another idea is to create a free-form design. This lets the circles flow organically across your base fabric. Do not be afraid to experiment with different layouts before you commit to stitching. Lay out your felt circles on the base fabric and adjust them until you are happy.

#### Playing With Color

Color choices bring your penny rug to life. You can opt for a monochromatic scheme using different shades of one color. This creates a subtle and sophisticated look. Alternatively, go bold with a vibrant mix of contrasting colors. I love how different colors can evoke different feelings.

Think about where your rug will live in your home. Choose colors that complement your existing decor. A good tip is to pick a main color for the largest circles. Then, choose two or three accent colors for the smaller circles. Lay out your felt pieces to see how the colors interact before cutting. This visual check helps ensure your design is balanced and appealing.

### 3. Cutting Felt Circles for Your Penny Rug Craft

Precise cutting is vital for a professional-looking penny rug. Even slight inconsistencies can show in the final design. Take your time with this step to ensure all your felt circles are neat and uniform. I find that good preparation here saves time and frustration later.

#### Making Templates

You need templates to ensure consistent circle sizes. You can use everyday items around your house for this purpose. Look for things like jar lids, plastic containers, or different sized coins. These make excellent guides for tracing. You can also buy specialized circle templates from craft stores.

I often cut templates from thick cardstock or thin plastic. This makes them reusable and more durable than paper. Label your templates with their sizes. This helps you keep track of which circle size you are cutting. Having various sizes, such as 1 inch, 2 inch, and 3 inch diameters, offers design flexibility.

#### Cutting Techniques

Once you have your templates, you are ready to cut your felt. Place the template firmly on your wool felt. Use a fabric pencil or chalk to trace around the template. Ensure your marks are clear but not too heavy. You want to see the line without having to scrub it off later.

When cutting, use your sharp fabric scissors. Cut smoothly and evenly along the traced line. Avoid making jagged cuts, as wool felt does not fray, but uneven edges will be noticeable. If you find cutting large numbers of circles tiring, take a break. Your hand will thank you, and your cuts will remain precise. This step is repetitive but crucial for a beautiful finish.

### 4. Assembling and Stitching Your Penny Rug

This is the most satisfying part for me—watching your design come to life with each stitch. Attaching the felt circles to your base fabric requires patience and careful hand-sewing. Each "penny" needs to be securely fastened. This ensures your rug will last for many years.

#### Pinning the Pennies

Before you start stitching, arrange all your felt circles on your base fabric. Make sure they are exactly where you want them. Use pins to hold each felt circle in place. Pin generously, especially on the edges of the circles. This prevents them from shifting as you begin to sew.

I like to start pinning from the center of the rug and work outwards. This helps keep the overall design centered. Overlap your circles as planned during your design phase. Ensure the base fabric is taut but not stretched. This helps maintain the rug's shape. Double-check your layout one last time before you pick up your needle.

#### Simple Stitching Methods

For a penny rug, a simple applique stitch works best. This means you will sew around the edge of each felt circle. I recommend using a whipstitch or a blanket stitch. Both stitches are strong and add a decorative touch. Choose an embroidery floss color that either matches your felt circle or provides a subtle contrast.

To perform a whipstitch:

1.  Bring your needle up from the back of the base fabric, right at the edge of the felt circle.
2.  Go back down through the felt circle and base fabric, a short distance from where you came up.
3.  Angle your needle slightly as you bring it back up for the next stitch.
4.  Keep your stitches evenly spaced and consistent in size. This creates a neat border around each "penny."

The blanket stitch is another lovely option. It creates a small loop along the edge of the felt. This adds more texture and visual interest. No matter which stitch you choose, keep your tension consistent. This prevents puckering or loose areas on your rug. Sewing by hand allows for greater control and a truly handmade feel. Remember, the quality of your wool felt influences the overall feel and durability, much like when you consider [what affects wool carpet price](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-is-wool-carpet) in larger home textiles. The natural strength of wool makes it a great choice for projects meant to last.

### 5. Finishing the Edges of Your Wool Felt Penny Rug

Once all your pennies are stitched down, your rug is almost complete. The final steps involve finishing the edges and adding a backing. These steps give your rug a polished look and protect it. A well-finished rug looks more professional and lasts longer.

#### Binding the Edge

The edges of your penny rug need a clean finish. You can do this by adding a binding strip. Cut a strip of wool felt or coordinating fabric about 1.5 to 2 inches wide. This strip should be long enough to go around the entire perimeter of your rug. Fold the strip in half lengthwise and press it.

Align the raw edges of your folded binding strip with the raw edge of your rug. Pin it in place all around the rug. Use a whipstitch or machine stitch to attach the binding. Make sure to catch all layers securely. When you reach a corner, fold the binding neatly to create a mitered corner. This creates a crisp and clean border for your rug.

#### Adding a Backing

Adding a backing to your penny rug provides extra stability and protection. It also hides all your stitches on the underside. You can use a sturdy piece of wool felt, canvas, or even non-slip rug backing material. Cut the backing fabric slightly larger than your finished penny rug.

Place the penny rug right side up on top of the backing fabric. Trim the backing so it matches the rug's shape. Pin the backing in place around the edges. Then, hand-stitch the backing to the rug using small, invisible stitches. You can also machine stitch around the perimeter if you prefer. This step strengthens the rug and prevents stretching. It also makes your rug feel more substantial.

### 6. Caring for Your Handmade Wool Felt Rug

Taking good care of your finished wool felt penny rug ensures its beauty lasts for years. Wool is a durable fiber, but it needs proper attention. Gentle cleaning methods help preserve its shape, color, and texture. I want my handmade items to be enjoyed for a long time.

#### Dusting and Spot Cleaning

Regular dusting is the best way to keep your penny rug fresh. You can gently shake it outdoors to remove loose dust and debris. For deeper cleaning, use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner on a low setting. Be careful not to pull on the stitches or felt circles. Always vacuum in the direction of the felt pile.

For spills or spots, act quickly. Blot the area with a clean, damp cloth. Use cold water and a mild soap specifically for wool. Do not rub the stain, as this can felt the wool or spread the stain. Always test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area first. This prevents any damage to your rug's colors.

#### Long-Term Care Tips

Proper storage and handling extend your rug's life. Avoid placing your penny rug in direct sunlight for long periods. UV rays can cause the wool colors to fade over time. Rotate your rug periodically if it is in a high-traffic area. This ensures even wear and tear.

If you need to store your rug, roll it loosely rather than folding it. Folding can create creases that are hard to remove. Store it in a breathable bag or container to protect it from dust and pests. Avoid plastic bags, as they can trap moisture. Keep your wool felt penny rug in a dry, cool place. By following these simple care steps, your beautiful creation will remain a cherished item for many years to come. Remember that quality wool, like that used in premium rugs, often benefits from similar care routines, a factor that also influences [how much wool carpet costs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-is-wool-carpet).

### 7. Creative Variations and Next Steps in Felt Crafting

Making a wool felt penny rug opens the door to many other felt crafting possibilities. Once you master the basic techniques, you can explore new designs and projects. This allows your skills to grow and keeps your crafting experience exciting. There is so much more you can do with felt.

#### Beyond Circles

While circles are classic for penny rugs, you are not limited to them. Try cutting felt into different shapes. You could make leaves, stars, or even small animal silhouettes. Incorporate these shapes into your rug designs. This adds a unique and personalized touch.

You can also experiment with different sizes and layers of shapes. For example, layer a small star on top of a larger circle. This creates a dynamic and visually interesting effect. Use variegated embroidery floss for stitching to add more color. This makes your stitches a decorative element themselves.

#### Other Felt Projects

The skills you learn making a penny rug are transferable to many other felt crafts. Consider making felt coasters, placemats, or wall hangings. These projects use similar cutting and stitching techniques. They are great ways to decorate your home with your own handmade items.

You can also explore making felt soft toys or decorative brooches. Felt is a versatile material that is easy to work with. It holds its shape well and comes in many vibrant colors. I encourage you to look for new patterns and ideas online or in craft books. Continuing to learn new techniques keeps your crafting journey fresh. The durability and natural appeal of wool felt, much like the factors that [determine wool carpet pricing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-is-wool-carpet), make it a fantastic choice for long-lasting, beautiful craft projects around the home.

### FAQ Section

**Q1: What kind of felt is best for a penny rug?**
Pure wool felt is the best choice for making a penny rug. It is durable, does not fray when cut, and has a rich texture. Blended wool felts can also work, but 100% wool felt offers the highest quality and longevity. Its natural properties make it ideal for this traditional craft.

**Q2: Can I machine wash a wool felt penny rug?**
No, I do not recommend machine washing a wool felt penny rug. Machine washing can cause the wool to shrink and felt further, distorting its shape and texture. Instead, spot clean any spills with a mild wool-safe detergent and cold water. Gently hand wash larger areas if necessary.

**Q3: How long does it take to make a penny rug?**
The time it takes to make a penny rug varies greatly. It depends on the rug's size, the complexity of your design, and your stitching speed. A small table mat might take a few hours or a weekend. A large rug could take several weeks of dedicated work. Enjoy the process rather than rushing.

**Q4: Do I need to use a special needle for felt?**
You do not need a highly specialized needle. A standard sharp hand-sewing needle or an embroidery needle works well. Choose a needle that is comfortable to hold and has an eye large enough for your chosen thread or floss. A thimble will be very helpful to protect your finger.

**Q5: Can I use fabric glue instead of stitching for a penny rug?**
While fabric glue can attach felt pieces, stitching is the traditional and recommended method for penny rugs. Stitching creates a more durable bond and adds to the handmade charm. Glue can sometimes stiffen the fabric or break down over time, leading to pieces detaching.

**Q6: What can I use a penny rug for?**
Penny rugs are versatile decorative items. You can use them as table toppers, placemats, or decorative mats under lamps. They also make beautiful wall hangings, adding texture and color to a room. Some people even use them as small floor rugs in low-traffic areas.
