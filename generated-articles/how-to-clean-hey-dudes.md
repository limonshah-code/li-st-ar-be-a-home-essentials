### Takeaway:

*   **Prepare shoes:** Remove insoles and laces, knock off loose dirt.
*   **Wash carefully:** Machine wash on a delicate cycle with cold water or hand wash gently.
*   **Address stains:** Spot treat specific marks before general washing.
*   **Air dry only:** Never put Hey Dudes in a dryer to prevent damage.
*   **Prevent odors:** Use baking soda or shoe deodorizers regularly.

You can clean Hey Dudes by machine washing them on a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent. Alternatively, hand wash them with a soft brush and soap. Always remove insoles and laces first. Air dry them away from direct heat to maintain their shape.

### Preparing Your Hey Dudes for a Deep Clean

Before you start cleaning, you need to prepare your Hey Dudes. This step helps ensure a better clean. It also protects your shoes during the process. Proper preparation prevents damage and makes the cleaning easier.

First, remove the insoles from your Hey Dudes. Most Hey Dude insoles are removable. You can wash these separately. Many people choose to hand wash insoles. This helps to eliminate odors trapped inside them. You can use warm water and a small amount of mild soap for this. Rinse them thoroughly and let them air dry completely before putting them back in.

Next, take out the laces. Laces can tangle in the washing machine. They also might not get as clean if left in the shoes. You can wash the laces by hand or put them in a mesh laundry bag with the shoes. Washing laces separately ensures they get clean. You can scrub them with a brush and soapy water.

Finally, remove any loose dirt or debris from your shoes. You can do this by clapping them together. A soft brush or an old toothbrush works well for scrubbing off dried mud. This step stops dirt from spreading during washing. It also makes the main cleaning process more effective. This preparation ensures your Hey Dudes are ready for a thorough wash.

### Machine Washing Your Hey Dudes Safely

Machine washing is a convenient way to clean your Hey Dudes. However, you must do it correctly. Incorrect washing can damage the shoes. Following these steps helps protect them. This method is generally safe for canvas or fabric Hey Dudes.

First, place your prepared Hey Dudes inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag protects the shoes from harsh tumbling. It also prevents the shoes from banging against the drum. You can also place them with a few towels. The towels act as a cushion during the wash cycle. Use old towels to avoid dye transfer.

Next, add a small amount of mild liquid detergent to your washing machine. Do not use harsh detergents or bleach. Bleach can damage the fabric. It can also change the color of your shoes. Use a gentle, color-safe detergent for the best results. A small amount is enough for a pair of shoes.

Set your washing machine to a delicate or gentle cycle. Use cold water. Cold water prevents shrinking and color fading. Hot water can damage the glue and fabric of your shoes. Choose a slow spin speed if your machine has that option. A slower spin is gentler on the shoes. Once the cycle finishes, promptly remove your Hey Dudes from the machine.

This ensures they do not sit wet for too long.

### Hand Washing Your Hey Dudes for Gentle Care

Hand washing is a gentler alternative to machine washing. It is ideal for shoes with delicate materials. It also works well for specific stains. This method gives you more control over the cleaning process. It can help extend the life of your Hey Dudes.

You will need a few basic supplies for hand washing. Gather a large basin or a clean sink. You will also need a soft-bristled brush. An old toothbrush works well for small areas. Prepare a mild soap or detergent. Dish soap can work, but a laundry soap made for delicates is better. Have a few clean cloths ready for wiping.

Fill the basin with cool or lukewarm water. Add a small amount of your mild soap. Mix the water and soap until it creates some suds. Do not use hot water. Hot water can damage the shoe fabric or glue. Submerge your Hey Dudes in the soapy water. Let them soak for a few minutes. This helps loosen dirt and grime.

Use your soft brush to gently scrub the shoes. Focus on dirty areas. Pay attention to seams and crevices. Do not scrub too hard, as this can damage the material. For tough spots, you can apply a tiny bit of soap directly to the brush. Rinse the shoes thoroughly under cool, running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Remaining soap can leave marks.

### Tackling Tough Stains on Your Hey Dudes

Stains can be tricky to remove from your Hey Dudes. Different types of stains require different approaches. Spot treating before a full wash is often best. This targets the stain directly. It prevents the stain from setting further into the fabric.

For mud or dirt stains, let the mud dry completely first. Once dry, you can brush off as much as possible. Use a stiff brush or an old toothbrush. Then, mix a solution of mild soap and water. Apply this solution to the stain with a cloth. Gently rub the area. Rinse with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat if needed until the stain lifts.

Grease or oil stains need a different method. Sprinkle a generous amount of cornstarch or baking soda on the stain. These powders absorb oil. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. The powder will absorb the grease. Brush off the powder. Then, use a mild dish soap solution and a brush to clean the remaining mark. Dish soap is good at cutting grease.

For stubborn marks or general discoloration on lighter-colored shoes, consider using a dedicated shoe cleaner. Some white shoes can be particularly challenging to keep pristine. For detailed guidance on [how to clean white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes), specialized products and techniques might be necessary to restore their brightness. If you notice any signs of mold, it is important to address it quickly. Learn [how to clean mold off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes) to protect your footwear and prevent further growth. Always test any cleaning solution on a small, hidden area first. This checks for colorfastness. Testing prevents accidental damage or discoloration.

### Drying Your Hey Dudes Correctly

Proper drying is crucial for your Hey Dudes. Incorrect drying can cause shrinking. It can also damage the shoe's shape. Always air dry your Hey Dudes. Never put them in a clothes dryer. The heat from a dryer can melt the glue. It can also cause the fabric to shrink unevenly. This will ruin the fit and appearance of your shoes.

After washing, gently squeeze out any excess water from your shoes. Do not wring them aggressively. This can distort their shape. Use a clean, dry towel to blot the shoes. Press the towel against the fabric to absorb water. You want to remove as much moisture as possible. This speeds up the drying process.

Stuff your Hey Dudes with paper towels or clean, dry cloths. This helps them keep their shape as they dry. It also helps absorb remaining moisture from the inside. Change the paper towels every few hours if they become very damp. Using newspaper is also an option, but be aware that the ink might transfer to light-colored shoes.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight. Direct sun can fade colors. It can also make certain materials brittle. A shady spot outdoors or near an open window indoors works best. A fan can also help circulate air. Allow them to dry completely before wearing them again. This can take 24-48 hours. Make sure they are fully dry to prevent mildew or odors.

### Odor Elimination and Freshness for Your Hey Dudes

Even after cleaning, Hey Dudes can sometimes retain odors. This happens because of moisture and bacteria. Keeping your shoes fresh is important. It makes them more pleasant to wear. There are simple ways to tackle shoe odor.

Baking soda is a natural odor absorber. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each shoe. Make sure to get it into the toe area. Let the shoes sit overnight or for several hours. The baking soda will absorb moisture and neutralize smells. In the morning, shake out the baking soda. You can use a vacuum cleaner with an attachment to remove any residue. This method is safe and effective.

Another option is to use dryer sheets. Place a fresh dryer sheet inside each shoe when you are not wearing them. Dryer sheets can help absorb odors. They also leave a fresh scent. Replace the dryer sheets regularly. This works well for light odors.

For persistent smells, consider specific shoe deodorizers. These products come in sprays or inserts. Sprays often contain antibacterial agents. Inserts absorb moisture and odor. Follow the product instructions for best results. Some essential oils, like tea tree oil, also have antibacterial properties. You can put a few drops on a cotton ball and place it in the shoe overnight. This can help kill odor-causing bacteria. Regularly rotating your shoes also helps. This allows each pair to fully air out between wears.

### Maintaining Different Hey Dude Materials

While most Hey Dudes are made of canvas or fabric, some come in different materials. Knowing the material helps you clean them correctly. Specific care ensures the shoe's longevity. Always check the label or product description for your specific pair.

For standard canvas or woven fabric Hey Dudes, the machine wash or hand wash methods discussed earlier are suitable. These materials are generally durable. They can withstand water and mild detergents. The key is to use cold water and gentle cycles. Avoid harsh scrubbing on woven patterns to prevent damage. Many Hey Dudes feature this classic fabric construction, making these general cleaning methods broadly applicable.

Some Hey Dudes come with knit or synthetic mesh uppers. These materials are often lightweight and breathable. They can usually be machine washed or hand washed similarly to canvas. However, be extra gentle with brushing. Aggressive scrubbing can pull threads or damage the mesh structure. A soft cloth or sponge is often better than a stiff brush for these materials.

Hey Dudes also offer models with suede or leather accents. Cleaning these materials requires different techniques. Never machine wash suede or leather. Water can stain and damage these materials. For suede, use a suede brush to remove dirt. A suede eraser can help with marks. For leather, wipe with a damp cloth and mild leather cleaner. Follow with a leather conditioner. If your Hey Dudes have mixed materials, spot clean the different parts. Avoid getting leather or suede wet if the rest of the shoe is being washed.

### Preventative Care: Keeping Your Hey Dudes Cleaner for Longer

Prevention is always better than intensive cleaning. Simple habits can keep your Hey Dudes looking good. Regular care reduces the need for deep washes. This extends their overall lifespan.

First, consider applying a water and stain repellent spray. These sprays create a barrier on the shoe's surface. They help repel liquids and prevent stains from setting in. Apply the spray according to the product instructions. Do this when the shoes are new and clean. Reapply periodically, especially after a wash. This adds an extra layer of protection.

Avoid wearing your Hey Dudes in extremely muddy or dirty conditions. If you know you will be in a messy environment, choose different footwear. This seems obvious, but it helps a lot. Reserve your Hey Dudes for drier, cleaner outings. This reduces exposure to grime and stains.

Wipe down your shoes regularly. After each wear, give them a quick wipe with a damp cloth. This removes surface dirt before it sets in. A quick clean takes minimal time. It prevents dirt from accumulating and becoming harder to remove. Pay attention to the soles as well. Brush off any dirt or small stones from the treads.

Store your Hey Dudes properly when not in use. Keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or damp areas. A shoe rack or box works well. This protects them from dust and moisture. It also helps them maintain their shape. Proper storage helps keep them fresh for your next wear.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I put my Hey Dudes in the dryer?**
No, you should never put your Hey Dudes in the dryer. The high heat can damage the glue. It can also cause the fabric to shrink. This will permanently alter the shoe's shape and fit. Always air dry your Hey Dudes to maintain their integrity.

**How often should I clean my Hey Dudes?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you wear them and how dirty they get. For regular wear, a light wipe-down after each use is good. A deep clean might be needed every few weeks or months. Clean them immediately if they get heavily soiled or start to develop an odor.

**What should I do if my Hey Dudes smell bad after washing?**
If your Hey Dudes still smell after washing, they might not have dried completely. Ensure they are bone-dry. Then, use baking soda inside the shoes overnight. You can also use shoe deodorizers or dryer sheets. Air them out in a well-ventilated area for an extended period.

**Can I use bleach on my white Hey Dudes?**
Avoid using bleach on your Hey Dudes. Bleach can weaken the fabric fibers. It can also cause yellowing over time, especially on white shoes. For white Hey Dudes, use a non-chlorine, color-safe whitener or a dedicated white shoe cleaner for best results. Gentle cleaning is always better.

**Are all Hey Dudes machine washable?**
