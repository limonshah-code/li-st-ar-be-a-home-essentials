*   Customize your pizza with favorite sauces, cheeses, and toppings.

To make pizza in your LG microwave with a readymade pizza base, simply spread your sauce and toppings onto the base. Place the prepared pizza on a microwave-safe plate. Cook it on high power for about 3 to 5 minutes. Adjust the time until the cheese melts and bubbles. The crust should feel warm and slightly firm.

## Why Choose Your LG Microwave for Quick Pizza?

Your LG microwave offers a convenient way to make pizza. It provides speed and ease. People often associate microwave ovens with reheating leftovers. They do not think of them for cooking main meals. Yet, for a readymade pizza base, the microwave works well. It delivers a hot, satisfying result in very little time. This makes it ideal for quick meals.

Using a microwave saves significant time compared to a conventional oven. You do not need to preheat it for a long period. This means less waiting for your hunger to pass. It uses less energy too. For single servings, a microwave is very efficient. It heats food directly and quickly.

A readymade pizza base does not require much cooking. It just needs heating through and melting the cheese. An LG microwave handles this task easily. It provides enough heat to warm the crust. It also melts the cheese into a gooey layer. While a convection microwave might give a crispier crust, a standard LG microwave still produces a good result for a quick bite. If you have a convection microwave, you can also explore how to make pizza in a convection microwave with a readymade pizza base for even better crust results.

This method also works well for small spaces. Dorm rooms, small apartments, or offices often have only a microwave. This makes it a great solution for anyone. You can have a fresh meal without a full kitchen. Enjoying pizza quickly becomes simple with your LG microwave.

## Gathering Your Ingredients and Equipment

Before you begin cooking, you must collect all your items. This step ensures a smooth cooking process. You avoid pausing midway. Having everything ready makes assembly fast and easy. I always lay out my ingredients. This helps me visualize the finished pizza.

You will need a readymade pizza base. These bases come in different sizes and thicknesses. Choose one that fits your microwave-safe plate. A thin crust base often works best. It cooks more evenly in the microwave. Thick crusts can sometimes become too soft.

Next, get your pizza sauce. Marinara sauce works well. You can use pesto or white sauce for a different flavor. Choose your favorite cheese. Mozzarella is a classic. A blend of cheeses adds depth. Prepare your toppings. Sliced vegetables, cooked meats, or herbs are all good choices. Remember, toppings must be thin and small. They cook better this way.

Your main equipment will be your LG microwave. You also need a microwave-safe plate. A plate that fits the pizza base is essential. Some microwaves come with a browning plate or crisper. If you have one, use it. This helps achieve a crispier base. If not, a regular ceramic plate works fine. Gather a spoon for spreading sauce and a knife for slicing toppings.

### Choosing the Right Readymade Base

Selecting the correct readymade pizza base is important. They vary in texture and thickness. Some bases are par-baked. Others are raw dough. For microwave use, a par-baked, thin-crust base is usually best. It requires less cooking time. This reduces the risk of a soggy crust.

Thin bases heat through quickly. They absorb less moisture during cooking. This helps keep them from becoming too soft. Avoid very thick bases for microwave cooking. They may not cook evenly. The center might remain doughy. Always check the packaging. Ensure the base is suitable for microwave use. Many brands provide instructions for different cooking methods.

### Topping Essentials for Microwave Pizza

Toppings are crucial for a great pizza. For microwave cooking, less is often more. Overloading your pizza can cause issues. Too many toppings make the pizza cook unevenly. They also release moisture. This leads to a soggy base.

Choose toppings that cook quickly or are already cooked. Sliced mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and olives work well. For meats, use pre-cooked pepperoni, ham, or shredded chicken. Small pieces are best. Distribute them evenly. This helps the heat reach all parts. Fresh herbs like basil add flavor after cooking. Remember, the goal is quick cooking. So, keep it simple and fresh.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Assembling Your LG Microwave Pizza

Assembling your pizza is a simple process. It sets the stage for a delicious result. I enjoy this part. It allows me to be creative. Follow these steps for a perfect setup. This ensures your pizza cooks evenly.

First, take your readymade pizza base. Place it on a microwave-safe plate. If you have a browning plate, use that for a crispier bottom. Make sure the base sits flat. A flat surface promotes even cooking.

Next, spread your pizza sauce onto the base. Use the back of a spoon. Leave a small border around the edge. This creates the crust. Do not use too much sauce. Excess sauce can make the base soggy. A thin, even layer is best.

Now, add your cheese. Sprinkle it generously over the sauce. Mozzarella cheese melts very well. You can also use a mix of cheddar and mozzarella. Ensure the cheese covers the sauce layer. It acts as a barrier for moisture.

Finally, add your chosen toppings. Distribute them evenly across the cheese. Remember my advice: do not overload. Small, thin pieces work best. They cook faster. They also allow the cheese to melt properly. For example, if using bell peppers, cut them into thin strips. If using cooked chicken, shred it finely. This step completes your pizza assembly. It is now ready for the LG microwave.

## Cooking Your Pizza in the LG Microwave

Cooking your pizza in the LG microwave is the final step. This part needs attention to timing. Microwaves heat food differently than ovens. They use electromagnetic waves. These waves excite water molecules in the food. This creates heat. Knowing your microwave helps.

Place your assembled pizza inside the LG microwave. Position it centrally on the turntable. The turntable ensures even cooking. If your microwave does not have a turntable, you may need to rotate the plate manually halfway through cooking.

Set the power level to high. For most LG microwaves, this is 100%. The cooking time will vary. It depends on your microwave's wattage. It also depends on the thickness of your base and toppings. I recommend starting with a short duration. Begin with 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, check your pizza. See if the cheese is melted and bubbling. The crust should feel warm. If not, add more time in 30-second intervals. This prevents overcooking.

When the cheese is fully melted and bubbly, your pizza is ready. Be careful when removing the hot plate. Use oven mitts. The plate and pizza will be very hot. Let the pizza rest for one minute. This helps it set. Then, slice and serve. Enjoy your quick LG microwave pizza.

### Optimal Time and Power Settings

Finding the right time and power settings is key. Each LG microwave model can perform differently. A standard readymade pizza base generally cooks well on high power. This is usually 800-1200 watts.

For a thin readymade base, 3 to 5 minutes on high power is a common starting point. If your microwave is lower wattage, you might need an extra minute or two. Observe the cheese. It should melt fully and show some bubbles. The crust should feel warm to the touch. If it feels cold in the center, cook for a little longer. It is always better to undercook and add more time. This is safer than overcooking. Overcooked microwave pizza becomes hard or rubbery.

### Achieving a Crispier Crust

A microwave's main function is heating, not crisping. It warms food. It does not brown it. Achieving a truly crispy crust in a standard LG microwave is challenging. However, you can use a few tricks. These help improve the texture.

One trick is using a microwave browning plate. Some LG microwaves have this accessory. These plates contain special material. It gets very hot. This high heat helps to crisp the bottom of the pizza base. Place the base directly on this plate. Then add toppings.

Another tip is to lightly brush the base with olive oil. Do this before adding sauce. The oil can help create a slightly crispier texture. Use only a small amount. Too much oil makes the pizza greasy. Also, avoid overloading toppings. Fewer toppings mean less moisture. Less moisture helps the crust stay firmer. You might consider using parchment paper under the pizza. This can absorb some moisture. These small steps make a difference. They make your LG microwave readymade pizza better.

## Tips for the Perfect LG Microwave Readymade Pizza

Making pizza in your LG microwave is fast. Achieving perfection takes a few extra steps. I have learned these tips from my own cooking. They make a big difference. Follow them for the best results.

First, consider your toppings. If you use moisture-heavy vegetables like mushrooms or fresh tomatoes, pre-cook them. A quick sauté removes excess water. This prevents a soggy crust. Cooked meats like chicken or sausage should also be pre-cooked and cooled. This ensures they heat through evenly with the pizza.

To prevent a soggy base, do not overload your pizza. Use a thin layer of sauce. Use a moderate amount of cheese. Keep toppings sparse and small. This helps the base cook more effectively. Some people also poke small holes in the base with a fork. This helps steam escape.

Adding fresh herbs after cooking is a great idea. Basil, oregano, or parsley add a fresh flavor. The heat of the microwave can dull herb flavors. Adding them at the end keeps them vibrant. A drizzle of olive oil after cooking also enhances taste.

Let your pizza rest for one minute after cooking. This allows the cheese to set. It also makes slicing easier. The pizza holds together better. Use a sharp pizza cutter. This gives clean slices. Cleaning your microwave regularly also helps with performance. Learn how to clean microwave stains to keep your LG microwave in top shape. You can also explore how to clean microwave with vinegar for a natural cleaning solution. After cooking, if you used a pizza pan, remember to clean it properly using tips like how to clean a pizza pan. This keeps your kitchen tidy for next time.

## Troubleshooting Common Microwave Pizza Issues

Even with readymade bases, microwave pizza can present small challenges. I have encountered these issues myself. Knowing how to fix them makes your pizza experience better. Here are solutions to common problems.

A common issue is a soggy base. This happens when too much moisture is present. The microwave heats water. It does not evaporate it like an oven. To fix this, use less sauce. Choose drier toppings. Pre-cook watery vegetables. A microwave browning plate helps a lot. It creates direct heat on the base.

Sometimes, the cheese does not melt evenly. This can happen if the toppings are too high. It also happens if the cheese is too thick. Spread your cheese in an even layer. Use shredded cheese, not thick slices. If only a small part is unmelted, give it another 30 seconds. Focus on the unmelted area.

Overcooked toppings are another problem. This often happens with thin items like pepperoni. The microwave heats them too fast. To prevent this, add quick-cooking toppings later. You can put them on after the cheese starts melting. Or, choose toppings that can handle more heat. For example, mushrooms can take more heat than spinach.

Uneven cooking can also occur. This is more common in microwaves without a turntable. If your LG microwave lacks a turntable, rotate the plate halfway through. Rotate it 180 degrees. This helps ensure all parts of the pizza cook similarly. Remember to clean your microwave vent regularly. This helps with proper air circulation and cooking performance.

## Creative Topping Ideas for Your Microwave Pizza

One of the best parts of making pizza is customizing it. Your LG microwave pizza can be just as creative. Do not limit yourself to basic pepperoni. I love experimenting with flavors. These ideas will inspire your next quick pizza meal.

For a classic combination, try Margherita style. Use tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella slices, and fresh basil leaves. Add the basil after cooking for best flavor. Another popular option is Pepperoni and Mushroom. Use regular pizza sauce. Add pepperoni slices and thinly sliced mushrooms.

If you prefer vegetables, make a Veggie Delight. Use a pesto base instead of tomato sauce. Top with diced bell peppers, onions, and black olives. You can also add some spinach. Wilt the spinach briefly before adding it. This reduces moisture. For a little kick, add some red pepper flakes.

Meat lovers can enjoy a BBQ Chicken pizza. Use BBQ sauce as your base. Add shredded, pre-cooked chicken. Sprinkle with some red onion. A sprinkle of cheddar cheese with mozzarella works well here. For a unique twist, try a breakfast pizza. Use a white sauce or no sauce. Top with scrambled egg, cooked crumbled sausage, and shredded cheese.

You can even make a dessert pizza. Use a chocolate spread or Nutella as the base. Top with sliced bananas, strawberries, or mini marshmallows. Cook it just long enough to warm the base and slightly melt marshmallows. Be careful not to burn the chocolate. The possibilities are vast. Your LG microwave makes trying new flavors simple and fast.
