The PE error on an LG washing machine indicates a problem with the water level sensor, also known as the pressure sensor. This sensor tells the machine how much water is inside. When the sensor fails, or its connection is bad, the washing machine cannot accurately detect the water level. This prevents the washer from starting or completing a wash cycle.

## Understanding the LG PE Error Code

When your LG washing machine shows PE, it points directly to an issue with the "Pressure Error" or water level sensor. This sensor is a small but vital component inside your washing machine. Its main job is to measure the water pressure in the tub. This measurement translates into a water level reading for the machine's control board. The washer needs this information to fill correctly and prevent overflows or dry runs.

Imagine trying to fill a tub with your eyes closed. You would not know when to stop the water. The pressure sensor acts like the washing machine's "eyes" for water levels. If this sensor malfunctions, the machine becomes "blind" to the water level. It will not know when it has enough water or if it is empty. This prevents the washer from moving to the next cycle step. It often triggers the PE error as a safety measure. My first reaction was usually to panic, but learning what the code means makes a big difference.

The sensor typically uses a small air trap and a hose connected to the bottom of the wash tub. As water fills the tub, it traps air in this hose. The pressure of this trapped air changes as the water level rises. The pressure sensor detects these changes and sends signals to the main control board. If the signal is incorrect, missing, or outside expected limits, the PE error appears. This tells you that the system for detecting water levels is faulty. Understanding this helps narrow down the troubleshooting. It means you can focus on specific parts rather than guessing.

Sometimes, the error is not due to a bad sensor. It might be a simple blockage in the sensor's air hose. Or, there could be a loose wire connection. The control board relies on an accurate signal from this sensor. Without it, the machine cannot perform essential functions like filling, washing, or rinsing. Many times, a quick check of the connections and the hose can resolve the issue. If your machine is showing the PE error, a quick [reset your LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-your-lg-washing-machine) can sometimes clear a temporary glitch.

## Common Causes of the PE Error

Several issues can cause your LG washing machine to display the PE error. Understanding these common causes helps you pinpoint the problem more accurately. Each cause relates to the water level detection system. We will explore each one in detail to help you diagnose your specific situation.

### Faulty Pressure Sensor

The most common reason for the PE error is a faulty pressure sensor itself. This sensor can wear out over time. It might stop sending accurate signals to the control board. If the sensor is bad, it cannot correctly measure the water level in the tub. This makes the washer think there is either too much or too little water. Sometimes, the sensor gives no signal at all. A faulty sensor requires replacement to resolve the issue.

### Blocked Pressure Sensor Hose

The pressure sensor connects to the wash tub via a thin rubber hose. This hose is crucial for transmitting air pressure from the tub to the sensor. If this hose becomes kinked, clogged with debris, or disconnected, the sensor cannot get an accurate reading. Soap residue, lint, or mold can build up inside the hose. This blockage prevents air pressure changes from reaching the sensor. Always check this hose thoroughly for any obstructions or damage. It is a common, easy-to-fix problem.

### Wiring Issues

The pressure sensor needs a good electrical connection to send signals. Damaged or loose wiring connected to the sensor or the main control board can cause the PE error. Rodents might chew wires, or connections can become corroded. Always check the wire harness leading to the pressure sensor. Make sure all connections are snug and clean. A simple loose wire can be the entire cause of your frustration.

### Water Supply Problems

While the PE error directly relates to the sensor, insufficient water supply can indirectly trigger it. If water does not fill the tub quickly enough, or if water pressure is too low, the sensor might not register the water level rising as expected within the machine's set time limit. This can confuse the control board and trigger the error. Check your water inlet hoses and water faucets to ensure adequate water flow. Make sure the water supply valves are fully open.

### Main Control Board Malfunction

Less commonly, a faulty main control board can cause the PE error. The control board processes signals from the pressure sensor. If the board itself is defective, it might misinterpret the sensor's readings or fail to receive them at all. This is usually the last thing to check after ruling out all other causes. Replacing the main control board is more complex and often requires a professional technician. Always exhaust other options before considering this costly repair.

## Troubleshooting Steps for LG PE Error

When your LG washing machine displays the PE error, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem. Most of these steps do not require special tools. They can help you identify and potentially fix the issue without professional help. I always start with the simplest solutions first, which often save time and money.

### 1. Reset Your Washing Machine

Sometimes, the PE error is just a temporary glitch in the machine's electronics. A simple reset can clear the error code. To reset, unplug the washing machine from the power outlet. Wait for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the control board to fully discharge any residual power. Then, plug the machine back in. Turn it on and try to start a new cycle.
