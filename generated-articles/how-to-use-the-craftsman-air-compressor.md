6.  **Power Connection**: Plug the compressor into a grounded electrical outlet. Make sure the outlet matches the compressor's voltage requirements.

## Powering On and Building Pressure

Turning on your Craftsman air compressor is simple, but knowing what to expect is helpful. Once you have completed the setup and safety checks, you are ready to power it on. Locate the power switch on your compressor. It is often a toggle switch or a button. Flip it to the "on" position.

When the compressor starts, you will hear the motor engage and the pump begin to work. The compressor will start filling the air tank with compressed air. The tank pressure gauge will slowly rise. This process can take a few minutes, especially for larger tanks or if the tank is completely empty. Be patient during this initial fill.

The compressor will run until the tank reaches its maximum pressure, which is usually around 125-150 PSI for most Craftsman models. Once this pressure is reached, the pressure switch will automatically turn off the motor. This is normal operation. If your compressor does not build pressure, or if it runs constantly without stopping, there might be an issue. For troubleshooting tips, you might find it useful to read about [why won't my craftsman air compressor build pressure](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-craftsman-air-compressor-build-pressure).

Once the compressor has reached maximum pressure and shut off, it is ready for use. Now, you can adjust the air pressure using the regulator. Turn the regulator knob clockwise to increase the output pressure. Watch the regulated pressure gauge to set the desired PSI for your tool. Different tools require different pressure settings. Always refer to your tool's manual for its specific PSI requirement.
