## How To Clean Water Intake On Washing Machine

Have you noticed your washing machine taking longer to fill? Maybe your clothes are not getting as clean as they used to be. A clogged water intake often causes these issues. It is a common problem many people face. Cleaning your washing machine's water intake helps keep your appliance working its best.

This guide will show you how to clean the water intake on your washing machine. We will cover why cleaning is important, what tools you need, and a step-by-step process. You will learn how to make sure your machine gets enough water for every wash cycle. Let's get your washing machine back to full power.

### Takeaway

*   **Turn off power and water:** Always disconnect electricity and water supply before starting work.
*   **Locate filters:** Find the small screens where the water hoses connect to the machine.
*   **Clean screens:** Remove and rinse the filters under running water, using a brush for stubborn debris.
*   **Check hoses:** Inspect hoses for blockages or damage while disconnected.
*   **Reassemble carefully:** Connect hoses tightly and restore power and water.

To clean a washing machine's water intake, first turn off the water supply and unplug the machine. Disconnect the water inlet hoses from the back of the washer. Locate and carefully remove the small filter screens inside the inlet ports. Clean these screens thoroughly under running water with a small brush, then reinstall and reattach the hoses.

### Why Your Washing Machine Needs Clean Water Intake

Your washing machine relies on a steady flow of water to work correctly. The water intake system includes hoses, screens, and a valve. These parts bring water into the machine. Over time, sediment, mineral deposits, and debris can build up in these areas.

This buildup blocks the water flow. If the water intake is clogged, your washing machine cannot fill fast enough. It might not fill at all. This leads to longer wash cycles and poorly cleaned clothes. It also puts stress on the machine's motor and pumps. Regular cleaning helps prevent these problems. It keeps your washing machine efficient and extends its life.

Ignoring a dirty water intake can cause bigger issues. Low water pressure in the machine can affect rinse cycles. It can leave detergent residue on your laundry. In some cases, a severe clog might prevent the machine from starting a cycle at all. Understanding these effects helps you see why routine maintenance is important. Keeping your water intake clean is a simple step for better laundry results. You might wonder, [why is my washing machine not getting water?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-washing-machine-not-getting-water) often a clogged intake is the culprit.

### Gathering Your Tools: What You Need for the Job

Before you start, make sure you have the right tools. Having everything ready makes the job easier and faster. You probably have most of these items at home. These tools help you clean your washing machine's water intake effectively.

You will need a few basic things for this task. First, get a pair of pliers or an adjustable wrench. These are useful for loosening stubborn hose connections. Next, you need a small bucket or towels. These will catch any water that spills when you disconnect the hoses. A small brush, like an old toothbrush, is perfect for scrubbing the filter screens.

You might also want some white vinegar or a mild descaling solution. These products help break down mineral deposits on the screens. A flashlight can be handy to see into tight spaces behind your machine. Finally, safety goggles protect your eyes from any debris. Gathering these items ensures you are prepared for the cleaning process. This preparation saves time and effort later on.

### Safety First: Turning Off Water and Power Supply

Safety is the most important step before you start any appliance repair. Working with water and electricity requires caution. Always ensure the machine is completely off and safe to work on. This prevents accidents and protects your appliance.

First, unplug your washing machine from the wall outlet. This cuts off all electrical power. Never work on an appliance while it is still plugged in. Next, you need to turn off the water supply to the washing machine. Look for two shut-off valves behind the machine, usually labeled "Hot" and "Cold." Turn these valves clockwise until they are completely closed. This stops water from flowing into the hoses.

If you cannot find specific valves for your washing machine, you might need to turn off the main water supply to your house. This ensures no water will escape when you disconnect the hoses. Taking these safety steps protects you from electric shock and water damage. It sets a secure foundation for the rest of the cleaning process.

### Disconnecting the Hoses and Accessing the Filters

Once the power and water are off, you can safely disconnect the hoses. This step lets you reach the water intake filters. Be ready for some water to spill out. Even after turning off the valves, some residual water stays in the hoses.

Place a towel or a small bucket under the back of your washing machine. This catches any water that might leak. Next, use your pliers or wrench to loosen the nuts connecting the hot and cold water intake hoses to the back of the washer. Turn the nuts counter-clockwise. Once loose, carefully unscrew the hoses by hand. Pull them away from the machine.

You will likely see small mesh filter screens inside the intake ports on the back of the washing machine. These screens are designed to catch sediment before it enters the machine's internal system. Sometimes, these screens are called inlet filters. They are usually small, round, and made of plastic or metal. Removing the hoses gives you direct access to these critical components for cleaning.

### Cleaning the Water Intake Screens (Inlet Filters)

Cleaning the intake screens is key to restoring water flow. These small filters catch debris and mineral deposits. Over time, they become clogged. A thorough cleaning ensures water can pass through freely again.

First, carefully remove the filter screens from the washing machine's water intake ports. You might need needle-nose pliers or tweezers to gently pull them out. Be careful not to damage them. Once removed, hold the screens under a faucet with strong running water. Rinse away any loose dirt or sediment.

For more stubborn buildup, use an old toothbrush or a small brush. Scrub both sides of the screen. If you see hard water deposits, soak the screens in white vinegar for about 30 minutes. This helps dissolve mineral buildup. After soaking, rinse them thoroughly again. Ensure all debris is gone and the mesh is clear. Clean screens let your washing machine fill properly and efficiently. This improves overall machine performance and laundry results.

### Inspecting and Cleaning the Water Inlet Valve

After cleaning the screens, inspecting the water inlet valve is a smart next step. The valve controls water entry into the machine. It can sometimes get clogged or malfunction. This inspection helps ensure the entire water intake system works well.

The water inlet valve is usually located directly behind the intake screens. It is a solenoid-controlled component. If the screens were very dirty, some debris might have made it past them. Look inside the valve's opening for any visible blockages. Use your flashlight to get a clear view.

You might need to use a cotton swab or a soft cloth to wipe around the valve's opening. Remove any dirt or mineral crust. Do not insert anything hard into the valve, as this can cause damage. If you suspect the valve itself is faulty, or if cleaning the screens does not fix your water flow problem, you might need professional help. A faulty valve can prevent water from entering, similar to a clogged screen. Checking this part ensures a complete water intake system clean.

### Reassembly and Testing Your Washing Machine

You have cleaned all the necessary parts. Now it is time to put everything back together. Reassembly must be done carefully. This ensures no leaks and your washing machine works as expected.

First, place the cleaned filter screens back into their respective intake ports. Make sure they are seated correctly and securely. Next, reattach the hot and cold water intake hoses to the washing machine. Screw the nuts on clockwise until they are hand-tight. Then, use your pliers or wrench to tighten them another quarter turn. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the connections.

Once the hoses are secure, slowly turn the hot and cold water supply valves back on. Check for any leaks around the hose connections. If you see drips, tighten the connection a little more. Finally, plug your washing machine back into the electrical outlet. Run a short rinse cycle without any laundry. Watch closely to ensure the machine fills with water at a normal rate and there are no leaks. This test confirms your cleaning work was successful. You will notice your washing machine fills faster now.

### Preventative Measures for a Clean Water Intake

Regular maintenance can prevent future clogs. Taking a few simple steps helps keep your washing machine's water intake clean. This extends the life of your appliance. It also ensures consistent performance.

One important step is to clean the water intake screens regularly. Aim to do this every six months, or more often if you have hard water. Hard water contains more minerals, which build up faster. You can also install a sediment filter on your main water line. This filter reduces the amount of debris entering your home's water system, including your washing machine.

Using the correct amount of detergent also helps. Too much detergent can lead to residue buildup. Consider using a washing machine cleaner periodically. These cleaners help break down soap scum and mineral deposits inside the machine, which can indirectly affect the intake system. Understanding [what to put in a washing machine to clean it](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-to-put-in-a-washing-machine-to-clean-it) can be very helpful for overall machine hygiene. By following these preventative measures, you can minimize the chances of a clogged water intake. This keeps your washing machine running smoothly for years.
