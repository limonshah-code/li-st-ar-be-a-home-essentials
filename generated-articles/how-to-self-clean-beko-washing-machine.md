Your Beko washing machine works hard. It cleans your clothes daily. Over time, it can accumulate dirt, detergent residue, and mold. This buildup causes unpleasant smells. It also affects cleaning performance. Knowing how to self clean your Beko washing machine is important. This guide will show you how to keep your appliance fresh and efficient. We will cover the specific Beko "Drum Clean" program. We will also detail essential manual cleaning steps. You can ensure your clothes come out truly clean. Regular cleaning helps your machine last longer. It also prevents costly repairs. Let us make your Beko shine again.

### Takeaway

Keeping your Beko washing machine clean is simple and important for its performance and longevity.

*   Run the "Drum Clean" or "Machine Care" cycle regularly, at least once a month.
*   Clean the detergent drawer, door gasket, and drain filter manually.
*   Use white vinegar, baking soda, or specialized cleaning tablets for effective cleaning.
*   Always leave the washing machine door ajar after use. This prevents mold and mildew.
*   Follow these steps for a fresh, efficient, and long-lasting Beko washing machine.

A Beko washing machine self-clean typically involves running a high-temperature wash cycle without laundry, often called "Drum Clean" or "Machine Care." This process, sometimes combined with a cleaning agent, removes detergent residue, mold, and odors. Regular manual cleaning of the detergent drawer, door seal, and filter complements this cycle.

## Why Your Beko Washing Machine Needs Regular Self-Cleaning

Your Beko washing machine provides clean clothes. However, the machine itself needs cleaning too. Water, detergent, and fabric softener residues build up inside. This leads to unpleasant odors and reduced performance. Regular self-cleaning prevents these issues. It ensures your machine stays efficient.

Ignoring machine cleaning can cause problems. Mold and mildew thrive in damp, dark places. Your washing machine drum and gasket are perfect breeding grounds. This growth leads to musty smells on your clothes. It also affects machine hygiene. Over time, residue buildup can block parts. This includes hoses and filters. Blockages reduce water flow. They can also cause draining issues. A dirty machine works harder. This uses more energy. It also shortens its lifespan. Regular cleaning solves these problems. It keeps your Beko performing at its best.

Understanding the "why" motivates the "how." A clean machine means truly clean laundry. It also prevents premature wear. You save money on repairs and energy bills. Think of it as preventative maintenance. Just as you clean your clothes, you must clean the machine that cleans them. This simple step keeps your household running smoothly. It protects your investment.

## Locating and Understanding the Beko "Drum Clean" Cycle

Beko washing machines often feature a dedicated self-cleaning program. This program is usually called "Drum Clean" or "Machine Care." This special cycle runs at a high temperature. It helps sanitize the drum. It also flushes out residues from internal components. Finding this cycle is usually straightforward on your machine's control panel.

On most Beko models, you will find "Drum Clean" as a specific program option. It might have a symbol, like a drum or a small cleaning brush icon. Consult your user manual for the exact location and name. Some older models might not have a dedicated cycle. In that case, you can run an empty hot wash cycle. Set the temperature to 90°C (194°F) or 95°C (203°F). This high temperature helps kill bacteria and mold. It also dissolves detergent buildup effectively.

The "Drum Clean" cycle is a vital part of machine maintenance. It cleans areas you cannot reach manually. It targets the drum's interior. It also flushes water lines. Using this cycle regularly prevents major issues. It keeps your machine smelling fresh. It also helps your clothes smell fresh too. Make running this cycle a routine. It takes little effort. It offers big benefits. To learn more about specific Beko cycles, you might find information on how to use Beko washing machine for the first time helpful. Some Beko models also include a "Drum Clean" option specifically detailed, which you can read about here: [How To Put Beko Washing Machine On Drum Clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-beko-washing-machine-on-drum-clean).

## Preparing Your Beko for the Self-Cleaning Process

Before you start the self-cleaning cycle, a few simple steps are necessary. These steps ensure the process works effectively. They also prevent any damage to your machine. Proper preparation helps you get the best results. It makes the cleaning more thorough.

First, ensure the washing machine drum is completely empty. Check for any forgotten items like socks or small clothes. Leaving items in the drum can damage them. It can also interfere with the cleaning cycle. Next, check the detergent dispenser drawer. Remove any visible residue. You can pull the drawer out completely on many Beko models. Rinse it under warm water. Use a small brush to scrub away any mold or hardened detergent. This drawer is often a hidden source of odors.

Also, quickly wipe down the inside of the door gasket. This rubber seal around the door often traps lint, hair, and moisture. Mold and mildew love to grow here. A quick wipe with a damp cloth removes loose debris. This prepares the gasket for a deeper clean later. Preparing the machine takes only a few minutes. It makes a big difference in the final cleaning outcome. This preparation phase is crucial. It sets the stage for a truly clean machine.

## The Step-by-Step Beko Self-Cleaning Process

Now it is time to run the main self-cleaning cycle. This is where your Beko machine does most of the heavy lifting. Following these steps ensures a thorough clean. It will leave your machine sanitized. It will also remove unpleasant odors.

Start by adding your chosen cleaning agent. You have several options here. You can use a dedicated washing machine cleaner. These come as tablets or powders. Follow the product instructions for dosage. Often, you place them directly in the detergent drawer or the drum. Alternatively, you can use natural cleaners. White vinegar is excellent for dissolving mineral deposits and killing bacteria. Pour 2 cups of white vinegar into the detergent dispenser or directly into the drum. Baking soda is another option. Add half a cup of baking soda to the detergent drawer. It helps neutralize odors. For a combined approach, use both. Add baking soda to the drum. Then add vinegar to the detergent dispenser.

Next, select the "Drum Clean" or "Machine Care" program on your Beko washing machine. If your model does not have this feature, choose the hottest wash cycle available. Select a setting like "Cotton" or "Heavy Duty" with the highest temperature, usually 90°C or 95°C. Start the cycle. Let the machine run its course completely. Do not interrupt it. The cycle usually takes 1.5 to 3 hours. It uses hot water to dissolve grime. It flushes everything away. Once the cycle finishes, wipe down the drum interior. Pay attention to the door gasket again. This removes any loosened residue. Your Beko should now be much cleaner.

## Beyond the Drum: Essential Manual Cleaning for Your Beko

While the "Drum Clean" cycle handles the drum, other parts of your Beko washing machine need manual attention. These areas trap residue and promote mold growth. Cleaning them regularly prevents odors. It also ensures efficient operation. Do not skip these important manual cleaning steps.

First, focus on the detergent dispenser drawer. Even after a self-clean cycle, this drawer can harbor mold and old detergent. Pull the drawer out completely. Most Beko models allow this. Soak the drawer in warm, soapy water. Use an old toothbrush or a small brush to scrub all compartments. Pay extra attention to corners and crevices. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely before reinserting. Also, clean the dispenser housing. Use a damp cloth to wipe inside the opening where the drawer sits. This area can get very grimy.

Next, give special attention to the door gasket, or rubber seal. This is a notorious spot for mold and mildew. Pull back the folds of the rubber seal. You will likely find black mold, lint, and trapped hair. Use a damp cloth with a mild detergent or a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water. Wipe all around the gasket. Scrub stubborn mold with a brush. You can also use a small amount of bleach solution for severe mold, but rinse very well afterward. Make sure to dry the gasket completely. This prevents immediate re-growth. Regularly cleaning this part is vital for preventing unpleasant smells from your Beko washing machine. If your Beko washing machine has a persistent smell, it might be due to a dirty gasket, which you can learn more about here: [Why Does My Beko Washing Machine Smell](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-beko-washing-machine-smell).

Finally, clean the drain filter. This filter traps lint, coins, and small items. It prevents them from clogging the pump. Locate the filter usually at the bottom front of your machine. Place a shallow pan or towel underneath to catch water. Open the small access door. Slowly unscrew the filter. Be prepared for a small amount of water to drain out. Remove any debris, lint, or foreign objects from the filter. Rinse the filter under running water. Use a brush if needed. Clean the filter housing too. Screw the filter back in tightly. Improperly secured filters can cause leaks. Regularly cleaning this filter improves drainage. It also protects your machine's pump. For detailed instructions on this, you can refer to information on [How To Clean Beko Washing Machine Filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-beko-washing-machine-filter).

## Natural Cleaning Alternatives for Your Beko Washing Machine

You do not always need harsh chemicals to clean your Beko washing machine effectively. Many common household items work just as well. They are safer for your family and the environment. Using natural alternatives is a great choice. It can keep your machine sparkling.

White vinegar is a cleaning powerhouse. Its acetic acid content breaks down mineral deposits and soap scum. It also kills mold and mildew. For a machine clean, pour two cups of distilled white vinegar into the detergent dispenser. You can also pour it directly into the drum. Run a hot, empty wash cycle or your machine's "Drum Clean" program. The vinegar will work its magic. It will leave your machine fresh. The vinegar smell will dissipate quickly.

Baking soda is another excellent natural cleaner. It is an effective deodorizer. It also acts as a mild abrasive. This helps scrub away grime. To use baking soda, sprinkle half a cup directly into the empty washing machine drum. For best results, use it with vinegar. Put the baking soda in the drum. Add two cups of vinegar to the detergent dispenser. Then run the hot cycle. The combination creates a fizzing action. This helps loosen stubborn dirt. It also neutralizes odors.

Citric acid is also an option. It is found in lemons and limes. You can buy powdered citric acid. It works similarly to vinegar in dissolving mineral buildup. For cleaning, use about 1/4 cup of powdered citric acid. Add it to the detergent dispenser. Run a hot, empty wash cycle. Citric acid is particularly good for hard water areas. It helps remove limescale. These natural options are simple. They are also highly effective. They keep your Beko clean without harsh chemicals.

## Maintaining a Clean Beko: Best Practices for Long-Term Freshness

Regular self-cleaning and manual spot cleaning are crucial. However, daily habits also play a big role. Adopting good practices extends the time between deep cleans. It also ensures your Beko washing machine stays fresh. These simple steps make a big difference.

First, always leave the washing machine door ajar after each wash cycle. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps the interior dry completely. A dry environment prevents mold and mildew from growing. This is especially important for front-loading machines. The sealed door can trap moisture. Even a small gap helps tremendously. This single habit is one of the most effective ways to prevent musty smells.

Second, use the correct amount of detergent. More is not always better. Overdosing on detergent creates excessive suds. These suds leave a sticky residue inside the machine. This residue traps dirt and promotes bacterial growth. Refer to your detergent's instructions. Adjust the amount based on your water hardness and load size. Consider using high-efficiency (HE) detergents for HE machines. They produce fewer suds. Also, switch between liquid and powder detergents periodically. Some users find this helps reduce buildup.

Third, remove clothes promptly after the wash cycle finishes. Leaving wet laundry inside the drum creates a humid environment. This encourages mold growth on both the clothes and the machine. If you cannot remove clothes immediately, at least open the door. This allows some air circulation. Lastly, consider running a quick rinse cycle or cold wash occasionally. This helps flush out any lingering detergent residues. These practices are easy to implement. They significantly contribute to a cleaner, fresher Beko washing machine. They will help your machine perform better for longer.
