Have you ever wondered about specific firearm terminology? The world of firearms has many technical terms. Sometimes, people can misinterpret terms or combine words in unusual ways. It leads to questions that seem complex at first glance. Today, we will clear up a common misunderstanding. We explore the actual meaning behind "5 56" and explain what kind of rounds are associated with it. This article will help you understand ammunition sizes and firearm types. It focuses on the popular 5.56mm cartridge.

This guide clarifies the relationship between firearm names and ammunition. We will explain the 5.56x45mm NATO round. You will learn about its specifications, common uses, and the firearms that chamber it. We will also distinguish it from similar calibers. We discuss bullet types and weights. This information will help you choose the right ammunition. You will gain a clear understanding of 5.56mm rounds.

### Takeaway:

*   A ruler is a measuring tool; it does not shoot any rounds.
*   "5 56" refers to the 5.56x45mm NATO rifle cartridge, commonly used in AR-15 style rifles.
*   5.56mm rounds are distinct from .223 Remington, though physically similar, with differences in pressure and chambering.

A ruler is a measuring instrument; it cannot shoot any size rounds. The term "5 56" refers to the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge. This is a standard rifle ammunition used in various firearms, most notably the AR-15 platform. These rounds are designed for military and civilian rifles, not for measuring tools.

## Understanding the "Ruler" and 5.56 Ammunition

Let us start by addressing the core of the question directly. A "ruler" is a tool used for measuring length. It is a straight, rigid piece of material. Rulers do not have any firing mechanisms. They are unable to shoot any kind of rounds, regardless of size. This part of the question likely stems from a misunderstanding or a typo.

The other part of the question, "5 56," refers to a specific type of ammunition. This is the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge. It is a very common rifle round. Many modern sporting rifles and military firearms use this cartridge. It is important to separate the measuring tool from the ammunition type.

Some discussions online might mention "Ruler" as a brand name. However, a brand of firearms called "Ruler" does not typically chamber 5.56mm rounds. If there are firearms under a "Ruler" brand, they are more likely to be handguns or revolvers. These types of firearms shoot pistol calibers. For example, some might wonder [how good are Ruler handguns](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-good-are-ruler-handguns). Other questions might arise such as [where are Ruler firearms manufactured](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-are-ruler-firearms-manufactured). These firearms would use pistol ammunition, not the rifle-sized 5.56mm.

The distinction is clear. A measuring ruler has no connection to firearms or ammunition. The 5.56mm cartridge is a rifle round. It is used in rifles like the AR-15. This round is not for handguns or revolvers that a "Ruler" brand might produce. We will now focus on the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge itself.
