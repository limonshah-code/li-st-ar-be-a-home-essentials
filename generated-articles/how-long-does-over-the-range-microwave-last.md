Wipe down the interior with a damp cloth after each use. For tougher stains, use a microwave-safe cleaner or a solution of water and lemon juice. Place a bowl of water with lemon slices inside and microwave it for a few minutes. The steam loosens grime for easy wiping.

### Clean or Replace Grease Filters

Over-the-range microwaves have grease filters, usually located underneath the unit. These filters trap grease and food particles from stovetop cooking. Over time, they become clogged. Clogged filters restrict airflow. This causes the exhaust fan motor to overwork and potentially overheat. Check your microwave's manual for filter cleaning instructions. Most are washable in hot, soapy water. Some need replacement every few months. This is a critical step I often see homeowners overlook.

### Clean the Exhaust Fan Vents

In addition to grease filters, the external vents where air exits need to be clean. Dust and grime can accumulate, blocking proper airflow. Use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner attachment to clear these vents. Proper ventilation prevents the microwave from overheating. This helps the internal components last longer.

### Check for Door Seal Integrity

The door seal (gasket) prevents microwave energy from escaping the unit. Over time, food debris can build up on the seal. This can cause it to crack or wear out. Inspect the door seal regularly for damage or debris. Clean it gently with a damp cloth. A damaged seal can lead to energy leakage. This is a safety hazard and reduces heating efficiency.

### Inspect Turntable and Rollers

The turntable and its support rollers ensure food rotates evenly. This promotes consistent heating. Remove the turntable and wash it regularly. Also, clean the rollers and the area underneath them. Food debris can jam the rollers. This stops the turntable from spinning properly. An unevenly heated meal is the least of your worries; it stresses the magnetron.
