### Clear Answer: How To Test Washing Machine Pump

To test a washing machine pump, first disconnect power and drain standing water. Next, access the pump and clear any blockages from its filter and impeller. Then, use a multimeter to check for continuity across the pump's electrical terminals. A reading of infinity or zero ohms typically confirms a faulty pump, requiring replacement.

## Understanding Washing Machine Drain Pump Function

Your washing machine's drain pump plays a vital role. It removes dirty water from the tub after each wash and rinse cycle. Without a working drain pump, your clothes remain submerged. This leaves them soaked and dirty. The pump consists of a motor, an impeller, and a housing. The motor spins the impeller, which pushes water out through the drain hose.

Problems with this pump are common. They can cause major inconvenience. Knowing how it works helps you diagnose issues faster. You can pinpoint whether the pump is truly the problem. Many people wonder if they can do this work themselves. Yes, it is often a [do-it-yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) repair. This saves on costly service calls.

A fully functional pump ensures efficient water removal. It prevents standing water and unpleasant odors. When the pump fails, water does not move. This means the wash cycle cannot complete. We must check the pump to see if it works. This simple check can tell you a lot.

## Recognizing Symptoms of a Failing Pump

How do you know if your washing machine pump is failing? Your machine will show several clear signs. Recognizing these symptoms early helps you act fast. A common sign is water left in the drum after a cycle. This means the pump did not remove the water. You might find a pool of water under the machine. This indicates a leak, possibly from the pump or its hoses.

Another symptom is unusual noises during the drain cycle. You might hear a humming sound, grinding, or loud rattling. This can mean the pump motor is struggling or has debris caught in it. Sometimes, the machine just stops mid-cycle. It might display an error code related to draining. These codes often point directly to pump problems. If your machine is showing symptoms, you should consider a full [washing machine diagnostic](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-samsung-washing-machine).

Ignoring these signs can lead to bigger problems. Mold can grow in the machine. Your clothes may not get clean. It is important to address pump issues quickly. Your family's laundry needs depend on it. Catching these problems early saves future headaches.

## Essential Safety Precautions Before You Start

Working with any appliance requires strict safety measures. A washing machine uses both water and electricity. This combination can be very dangerous if you are not careful. Always disconnect power to the machine first. Unplug the power cord from the wall outlet. Do not just turn off the machine; remove the plug. This prevents accidental startup or electrical shock.

Next, turn off the water supply. Close the hot and cold water valves behind the machine. This stops water from entering the unit. You will need to drain any remaining water from the tub. Place a shallow pan or towels under the drain hose connection. Disconnect the drain hose and let the water flow out. Be ready for a good amount of water.

Wear protective gloves to guard against sharp edges. The inside of an appliance can have metal parts. Safety glasses protect your eyes from splashes or debris. It is also wise to have a helper if you need to move the machine. Washing machines are heavy. Lifting them alone can cause injury. Safety is always your first priority.

## Gathering Your Tools: What You Will Need

Before you start testing your washing machine pump, gather all necessary tools. Having everything ready saves time and frustration. You will need a few basic items. First, a screwdriver set is essential. You might need Phillips head or flathead screwdrivers. Some washing machines also use Torx screws. A nut driver or a small wrench set might be necessary too. These help remove access panels.

A pair of pliers can be very useful. They help with hose clamps or stubborn connections. You will definitely need a multimeter. This device measures electrical properties. It is crucial for testing the pump's electrical continuity. Make sure its battery is fresh. You will also need a shallow pan or bucket. This collects any water remaining in the machine. Towels are also important for absorbing spills.

A flashlight will help you see into dark areas. The pump is often located in a hard-to-reach spot. A small brush or old toothbrush can help clean debris. This helps if you find clogs. Having these tools ready ensures a smooth process. You will be prepared for each step.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Accessing the Pump

Accessing the washing machine pump is the first physical step. The pump's location varies by machine model. Most front-loader pumps are at the bottom front. Top-loader pumps are often located behind a removable front or back panel. Always consult your owner's manual for specific instructions. Each model has its own quirks.

Start by moving the washing machine. Pull it away from the wall to create space. Lay down old towels or a blanket to protect your floor. Now, identify how to open the machine. For front-loaders, you often remove a lower access panel. This panel usually clips on or has a few screws. For top-loaders, you might tilt the machine back or remove the front panel. Some models require removing the back panel instead.

Once you find the pump, you will see hoses attached to it. You will also see electrical wires. Take a picture before you disconnect anything. This helps you remember where everything goes. Carefully disconnect the hoses. Be ready for some water to spill out. Keep your pan and towels handy. Now, disconnect the electrical connectors from the pump. You can then unmount the pump from its housing. Now, you have the pump ready for testing.

## Visual Inspection: Checking for Blockages and Damage

With the pump removed, your next step is a thorough visual inspection. Many pump issues stem from simple blockages. Look closely at the pump's impeller. This is the spinning part that moves water. Foreign objects like coins, buttons, or lint can get lodged here. These blockages stop the impeller from turning. Use your fingers or a small tool to carefully remove any debris. Be gentle to avoid damage.

Next, inspect the pump filter. Many washing machines have a small filter near the pump. This filter catches lint and small items before they reach the pump. A clogged filter severely restricts water flow. Refer to our guide on [how to clean a Bosch washing machine pump filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bosch-washing-machine-pump-filter) for detailed cleaning instructions. Remove the filter and clean it thoroughly under running water.

Also, check the pump housing and hoses for cracks or damage. A cracked housing can cause leaks. Damaged hoses also lead to leaks. Look for signs of wear on the impeller blades. If the blades are broken or heavily worn, the pump cannot move water efficiently. This visual check often identifies the problem without needing further electrical tests. A damaged impeller or housing requires pump replacement.

## Electrical Testing of the Pump Motor with a Multimeter

If the pump is free of blockages and visible damage, the problem likely lies with its electrical components. This is where your multimeter becomes essential. We will test the pump motor for continuity. Continuity means electricity can flow through the circuit. No continuity means an open circuit, indicating a bad motor.

First, set your multimeter to the ohms (Î©) setting. Choose a low range, like 200 ohms. Touch the two probes of the multimeter together. The display should read close to zero ohms. This confirms the multimeter is working. Next, locate the electrical terminals on the pump motor. There are usually two or three terminals. Most washing machine drain pumps have two terminals.

Place one multimeter probe on each terminal of the pump motor. Hold them firmly. The multimeter should display a specific resistance reading. This reading varies by pump model. It usually falls between 5 and 20 ohms. If your multimeter reads "OL" (open loop) or "infinity," there is no continuity. This means the motor winding is broken. The pump needs replacement. A reading of zero ohms might indicate a short circuit, also meaning the pump is bad. If you're also troubleshooting other components, learning [how to test a 3-wire washing machine motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-a-3-wire-washing-machine-motor) might offer useful insights into motor diagnostics.

## Testing for Power Supply to the Pump

Sometimes, the pump itself is fine, but it does not receive power. This means the issue is with the machine's electrical system, not the pump. You can test for power supply at the pump's electrical connector. Remember, this test involves live electricity. Exercise extreme caution. If you are uncomfortable, call a professional.

Reconnect the pump's electrical connector to the machine. Do not reassemble the entire machine yet. Ensure the pump is still easily accessible. Plug the washing machine back into the wall outlet. Turn on the machine and select a drain or spin cycle. Listen closely. The machine should attempt to energize the pump.

Now, set your multimeter to AC voltage (VAC) mode. Choose a range appropriate for your home's voltage (e.g., 200V or 250V). Carefully place the multimeter probes into the pump's electrical connector, where the wires supply power. Be very careful not to touch any metal parts. The multimeter should display a voltage reading. This reading should be close to your home's standard voltage (e.g., 120V in North America). If you get no voltage reading, the problem is upstream. It could be the wiring, the control board, or another component. If you get voltage but the pump does not run and failed the continuity test, the pump is indeed faulty.

## Troubleshooting Common Pump Issues

Many issues can cause a washing machine pump to malfunction. Often, the problem is not a completely broken pump. It might be a solvable issue. We already discussed blockages in the impeller and filter. These are the most common culprits. Always check these first. Make sure nothing restricts the impeller's movement.

Another common issue is a kinked or clogged drain hose. The pump pushes water out, but if the hose is blocked, water cannot escape. Disconnect the drain hose from the machine and check inside. You might find lint buildup or foreign objects. Also, ensure the hose is not bent sharply. A bent hose restricts flow.

Sometimes, the pump simply gets stuck. This can happen if it has been inactive for a while. With the power disconnected, try manually turning the impeller. Some pumps allow this. If it feels stiff, try freeing it gently. If the pump runs intermittently, it could be a loose electrical connection. Check all wires for a secure fit. Ensure the wires are not frayed or damaged. These simple checks can often bring your pump back to life.

## When to Replace Your Washing Machine Pump

After performing all tests, you will know if your pump needs replacement. If the multimeter shows no continuity, the pump's internal motor is dead. If the impeller is broken or heavily worn, it cannot move water. If the pump housing has cracks and leaks, replacing it is the only solution. These are clear signs that the pump has reached the end of its life.

Attempting to repair a severely damaged pump is usually not practical. The cost and effort outweigh buying a new one. New washing machine pumps are relatively inexpensive. They are also easy to install. Many online retailers and appliance parts stores carry replacement pumps. Make sure you get the correct part for your specific washing machine model. Your owner's manual or the pump itself will have model numbers.

Replacing the pump is a straightforward process. You simply install the new pump where the old one was. Reconnect the hoses and electrical wires. Double-check all connections. Once installed, test the machine with a short cycle to ensure everything works. Learning [how to replace a Bosch washing machine pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-bosch-washing-machine-pump) can give you more specific guidance for that brand. This DIY replacement can save you a lot of money.

## Reassembly and Final Testing

Once you have tested or replaced the pump, it is time to put everything back together. Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly. First, securely mount the pump back into its position. Make sure all screws or clips are firmly in place. Reconnect the electrical wires to the pump terminals. Ensure they are tight and properly seated. Check the color coding or your earlier photo if you are unsure.

Next, reattach the drain hoses to the pump. Secure them with the hose clamps. Make sure the clamps are tight. This prevents leaks during operation. Check all other hoses and connections you might have disturbed. Once all components are secure, reattach any access panels. Fasten them with the screws you removed earlier.

Finally, push the washing machine back into its spot. Reconnect the water supply hoses. Open the hot and cold water valves. Plug the machine back into the electrical outlet. Run a short rinse and spin cycle without any clothes. Carefully watch for any leaks. Listen for unusual noises. If the water drains properly and there are no leaks, you have successfully tested or replaced your washing machine pump.
