*   **Drip Tray:** Catches excess fats and juices. This prevents mess inside the microwave.
*   **Heat-Resistant Gloves:** Protect your hands when handling hot dishes and the rack.
*   **Tongs or Spatula:** Use these for turning food. This ensures even grilling on all sides.

Some models might have a special crisp plate or a grilling pan. These are designed to absorb heat. They then transfer it directly to the food. This creates an extra crispy crust. Check your microwave's manual to see if it supports such accessories. Using the right tools makes grilling in a convection microwave easy and safe. It helps you get the best results every time. Remember, the right accessories protect both you and your appliance. They also improve the quality of your grilled dishes significantly.

## Preparing Your Food for Convection Microwave Grilling

Proper food preparation is key for excellent grilling results in a convection microwave. Start by ensuring your food is ready for grilling. For meats like chicken breasts or fish fillets, pat them dry with paper towels. Excess moisture can steam the food instead of browning it. This simple step helps achieve a crispy exterior. Marinating your food can add flavor and moisture. However, blot off excess marinade before grilling. Too much liquid can hinder browning.

Cut your food into uniform pieces. This ensures even cooking. Smaller, thinner cuts generally grill better in a convection microwave. They cook faster and brown more evenly. For vegetables, slice them into consistent thicknesses. This avoids some pieces burning while others remain raw. Consider pre-cooking denser vegetables like potatoes or carrots slightly before grilling. This ensures they are tender inside.

*   **Pat Food Dry:** Remove surface moisture from meats and vegetables. This promotes browning.
*   **Marinate (Optional):** Add flavor. Blot off excess marinade before grilling.
*   **Uniform Sizing:** Cut food into consistent pieces for even cooking.
*   **Oil Lightly:** Brush a thin layer of cooking oil on the food. This helps achieve a nice char and prevents sticking.
*   **Season Well:** Apply your preferred herbs and spices. Seasoning sticks better to lightly oiled surfaces.

Arrange your food in a single layer on the metal grill rack. Do not overcrowd the rack. Overcrowding reduces air circulation. It can lead to steaming instead of grilling. Leave some space between each piece. This allows the hot air and radiant heat to reach all surfaces. Place the grill rack on a heat-resistant plate or drip tray. This catches any drippings. Proper preparation saves time and improves the outcome. It sets the stage for a delicious grilled meal.
