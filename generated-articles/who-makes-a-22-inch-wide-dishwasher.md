## Finding Your Perfect Fit: Who Makes A 22 Inch Wide Dishwasher?

Finding the right appliances for a small kitchen can feel like a real challenge. You might dream of a full-size dishwasher but face limited space. Standard dishwashers often come in very common widths like 24 inches or 18 inches. This makes locating a specific 22 inch wide dishwasher a unique task.

This article guides you through the world of compact dishwashers. We will identify the manufacturers that offer slimline options. You will learn about key features for these smaller units. We will also provide installation tips for your compact kitchen space. Let us explore the best choices for your home together.

### Takeaway

*   **True 22-inch built-in dishwashers are very rare.** Most manufacturers focus on 18-inch or 24-inch models.
*   **18-inch slimline dishwashers** are the most common alternative for narrow spaces. Major brands like Bosch, GE, and Whirlpool offer them.
*   **Portable dishwashers** sometimes come in widths around 20-22 inches. These are excellent for flexible setups.
*   **Measure your space carefully.** Ensure proper clearance for installation.
*   **Focus on essential features** like capacity, noise level, and wash cycles for compact units.

Finding a true 22-inch wide built-in dishwasher is quite uncommon. Manufacturers primarily produce dishwashers in standard 18-inch (compact) or 24-inch (standard) widths. You will mostly find options close to 22 inches in the form of portable dishwashers or from niche, often European, appliance brands that cater to highly customized spaces.

## Dishwasher Dimensions: Why 22 Inches is a Specific Size

Kitchen appliance sizes follow common standards. This helps with cabinet design and replacement. When we talk about dishwashers, two widths are most popular. The standard full-size dishwasher is typically 24 inches wide. This size fits most kitchens and offers ample capacity for dishes.

For smaller kitchens or apartments, 18-inch wide dishwashers are the go-to compact option. These slimline models save significant space. They still provide the convenience of automated dishwashing. My experience shows that finding a precise 22 inch wide dishwasher is much harder. This width falls between the two common sizes, making it a specialized request.

A 22-inch width might arise from older cabinetry. It could also come from custom kitchen designs. Such specific dimensions require careful searching. Most appliance stores will not stock this exact size. You often need to look for manufacturers known for offering unique or non-standard dimensions. Understanding these typical measurements is key. It helps you set realistic expectations for your search. Knowing [how wide is the standard dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-wide-is-the-standard-dishwasher) can guide your choices. It shows you what is readily available versus what requires a special search. We commonly see 24-inch and 18-inch models dominate the market. Knowing [how wide is a standard size dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-wide-is-a-standard-size-dishwasher) helps you understand the general market.

## Major Brands and Their 18-Inch Slimline Models

Since finding a precise 22 inch wide dishwasher is challenging, let us discuss the closest common alternative. Many leading appliance brands offer 18-inch wide slimline dishwashers. These models are designed for smaller kitchens. They fit into narrower cabinet openings. This size is readily available from reputable manufacturers.

Bosch is a prime example of a brand with excellent 18-inch models. Their compact dishwashers are known for quiet operation. They also have good cleaning performance. We often recommend them for quality and reliability. GE also provides efficient 18-inch dishwashers. Their models offer various features at different price points.

Whirlpool and Frigidaire also have strong contenders in the 18-inch category. These brands focus on practical features. They make dishwashing easier in compact spaces. Summit Appliance specializes in compact and specialty appliances. They offer a range of smaller dishwashers, including 18-inch built-in and portable options. Danby is another brand known for compact appliances. They often have portable dishwashers that might come close to the 22-inch mark in their overall dimensions. My research into [who makes the best dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/who-makes-the-best-dishwasher) often highlights brands excelling in specific categories, including compact models. These 18-inch units represent the best slimline solutions for most people. While 22-inch is rare, some specific European brands might offer models around 23.5 inches, as indicated by questions like [do they make 23.5 inch dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-they-make-23-5-inch-dishwashers), which still means a custom fit.

## Exploring True 22-Inch Options: Niche Manufacturers and Portable Units

When you search specifically for a 22 inch wide dishwasher, you enter a niche market. Built-in models at this exact width are very rare. Most appliance manufacturers stick to 18-inch or 24-inch sizes for their standard built-in lines. This means you might need to broaden your search. Consider specialized brands or look at different types of dishwashers.

Some European appliance manufacturers might offer more varied slimline dimensions. Brands like Miele or Gaggenau focus on high-end, custom kitchen solutions. They occasionally have compact models that could be closer to your specific need. However, these are often premium products with a higher price tag. They also might require specialized ordering or installation. It is worth checking their product catalogs for precise dimensions.

Portable dishwashers present a more common solution. These units do not require permanent installation. They connect to your kitchen faucet for water. Many portable models come in widths around 20 to 22 inches. This makes them a viable option for tight spaces. Brands like SPT, Danby, and Farberware produce popular portable dishwashers. These units offer flexibility. You can move them out of the way when not in use. They are perfect for renters or those needing a temporary solution. While not a built-in 22 inch wide dishwasher, a portable unit can provide the cleaning power you need. It fits many small kitchen layouts.

## Key Features to Look for in Compact Dishwashers

Choosing a compact dishwasher, including a potential 22 inch wide dishwasher or an 18-inch model, requires careful thought. Size is just one factor. Several features make a big difference in how well the appliance serves your home. Consider these points before making a purchase.

First, think about **capacity**. Compact dishwashers typically hold 6-8 place settings. This is enough for 1-2 people or small families. Full-size models hold 12-14 place settings. Ensure the capacity meets your daily needs. You do not want to run the dishwasher multiple times a day.

Second, **noise level** is important, especially in open-concept homes. Dishwashers are measured in decibels (dB). Lower numbers mean quieter operation. Look for models under 50 dB for a peaceful kitchen. Many slimline models from top brands offer quiet cycles.

Third, check for **energy efficiency**. An Energy Star rating means the appliance meets strict energy guidelines. This saves you money on utility bills. It also helps the environment. Efficient models use less water and electricity per cycle.

Fourth, examine the **wash cycles and options**. Even compact units offer varied settings. You might find options for heavy wash, light wash, or quick wash. A sanitize cycle is good for baby bottles or cutting boards. A delay start feature can also be useful for running the dishwasher at off-peak hours.

Finally, consider the **interior material and racking**. Stainless steel tubs are durable and help with drying. They also absorb sound better than plastic. Look for flexible racking. Adjustable tines or a third rack can maximize loading space. These features make your compact dishwasher more versatile.

## Installation Considerations for a 22-Inch Dishwasher Space

Installing any dishwasher, especially a non-standard size like a 22 inch wide dishwasher, needs precise planning. Proper installation ensures the appliance functions correctly and safely. It also prevents costly errors. I always advise people to measure their space at least twice.

Start by measuring the width, height, and depth of your cabinet opening. Use a tape measure. Be very precise. Remember that the dishwasher needs clearance. This means space on the sides and top. Typically, you need about 1/8 to 1/4 inch of clearance around the appliance. This allows for easy sliding during installation. It also accounts for slight variations in the appliance or cabinet. Knowing [how wide is a dishwasher cabinet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-wide-is-a-dishwasher-cabinet) for standard sizes helps you compare. Your specific 22-inch need might require custom cabinetry work.

Next, consider the plumbing and electrical hookups. A dishwasher requires a hot water line, a drain line, and an electrical connection. Ensure these are conveniently located behind the dishwasher space. If you are replacing an old unit, check if the existing hookups are compatible. You might need new hoses or adapters. If you are installing in a new spot, professional help is often best.

For built-in models, the appliance slides into the cabinet opening. It then fastens to the countertop or cabinet sides. This prevents tipping. Portable dishwashers are simpler. They roll into place and connect to your faucet. They require an accessible sink and power outlet. Even with portable units, check their dimensions. Ensure they fit through doorways or into storage spaces when not in use. Always follow the manufacturer's installation guide. If you feel unsure, hiring a professional installer is a wise investment. They ensure everything is done correctly and safely.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Opting for a Narrow Dishwasher

Choosing a narrow dishwasher, whether an 18-inch model or a rare 22 inch wide dishwasher, comes with specific pros and cons. It is important to weigh these factors before making your final decision. Your lifestyle and kitchen space will guide the best choice.

**Advantages of a Narrow Dishwasher:**

*   **Space-Saving:** This is the most obvious benefit. A narrow dishwasher fits into smaller kitchens, apartments, or tiny homes. It frees up valuable counter or cabinet space. This is ideal when every inch counts.
*   **Ideal for Smaller Households:** If you live alone or with just one other person, a compact dishwasher is perfect. It holds enough dishes for a few meals. This prevents dishes from piling up and reduces wait times for a full load.
*   **Water and Energy Efficiency (for small loads):** Since these units have smaller tubs, they use less water and energy per cycle. This is more efficient than running a half-empty full-size dishwasher. This can lead to lower utility bills over time.
*   **Flexible Installation:** Portable narrow dishwashers offer incredible flexibility. You can move them as needed. They do not require permanent plumbing changes. This is great for renters or temporary living situations.

**Disadvantages of a Narrow Dishwasher:**

*   **Limited Capacity:** The biggest drawback is capacity. You cannot fit large pots, pans, or many dishes at once. If you frequently entertain or have a large family, you might need to run multiple cycles. This negates some of the water and energy savings.
*   **Fewer Advanced Features:** Some compact models, especially lower-priced ones, might have fewer wash cycles or advanced features. You might miss out on specialized racks, smart connectivity, or ultra-quiet operation found in premium full-size models.
*   **Availability Issues:** As discussed, a specific 22 inch wide dishwasher is very rare. Even 18-inch models have fewer options than 24-inch ones. This limits your choices in terms of brands, styles, and features.
*   **Cost Per Place Setting:** While the overall price might be lower, the cost per place setting can be higher than a full-size unit. You pay for the specialized compact design. This means less bang for your buck in terms of dish capacity.
*   **Installation Can Be Tricky (for non-standard built-ins):** If you are truly trying to fit a 22-inch built-in, you might face challenges. This could involve custom cabinetry adjustments. This adds to the overall project cost and complexity.
