We spend many hours in our cars. Clean air inside is very important. You can learn more about [what HEPA filter is made of](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-hepa-filter-made-of) to understand its components. Understanding [what does HEPA filter stand for](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-does-hepa-filter-stand-for) also clarifies its purpose.

### How HEPA Filters Work

HEPA filters function through a combination of mechanisms. Air flows through a mat of randomly arranged fibers. These fibers are typically fiberglass. They trap particles in several ways:

*   **Impaction:** Large particles hit the fibers directly. They stick to the fibers.
*   **Interception:** Medium-sized particles follow the airflow. They touch a fiber and stick.
*   **Diffusion:** Very small particles move randomly. This random movement causes them to collide with fibers. They then stick.

This process ensures that a wide range of particle sizes are captured. The filter creates a clean air stream. Tesla's system often includes both a HEPA filter and an activated carbon filter. This combination handles both particulate matter and gaseous pollutants. The carbon layer removes fumes, odors, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This dual protection is superior for air quality. It means the air inside your Model Y is cleaner than the air outside.
