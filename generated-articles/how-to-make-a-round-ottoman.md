## Crafting Your Own Round Ottoman: A DIY Guide

Have you ever looked at store-bought ottomans and wished they fit your space better? Making your own furniture gives you control. You get to pick the size, fabric, and style. Today, I will show you how to make a round ottoman. This guide helps you create a custom piece for your home. We cover everything from planning to finishing touches. Get ready to add a unique and functional item to your living space.

### Takeaway

*   Plan your ottoman's size and style before you begin.
*   Build a strong, round wooden base for durability.
*   Apply foam and batting to create a soft, comfortable top.
*   Upholster with your chosen fabric for a custom look.
*   Add legs for stability and a finished appearance.

Making a round ottoman at home involves constructing a circular wooden base, applying thick foam and batting for comfort, and then expertly upholstering it with fabric. You finish by adding stylish legs, resulting in a personalized, functional piece of furniture that matches your decor.

## Planning Your Custom Round Ottoman Project

Starting any DIY furniture project needs good planning. This applies to creating your own round ottoman. First, decide where your ottoman will go. Will it be a footrest, extra seating, or a coffee table? This choice helps determine the size and height. I like to measure the space carefully. Consider the scale next to existing furniture.

Next, think about the design. Do you want tufting or smooth upholstery? What about the legs? They can be short and chunky or tall and elegant. Sketching a few ideas helps visualize the final piece. I find this step important for guiding my material choices.

### Essential Tools and Materials for Your Ottoman

Gathering your tools and materials before starting saves time. You will need certain items for cutting wood, assembling the base, and upholstery. A jigsaw or circular saw is good for cutting round wood pieces. A drill helps with attaching wood. A staple gun is a must for fabric work.

For materials, strong plywood or MDF works well for the base. High-density foam gives good support. Batting adds softness. Fabric is your chance to show personality. Choose durable upholstery fabric. Don't forget wood glue, screws, and ottoman legs. Having everything ready means a smoother building process.

*   **Tools:**
    *   Jigsaw or circular saw
    *   Drill with various bits
    *   Staple gun (electric or pneumatic recommended)
    *   Measuring tape
    *   Fabric scissors
    *   Utility knife
    *   Sandpaper
    *   Pencil or marker
    *   Fabric glue (optional)
*   **Materials:**
    *   Plywood or MDF (¾ inch thick for top/bottom, ½ inch for sides)
    *   High-density foam (3-6 inches thick)
    *   Polyester batting (2-3 layers)
    *   Upholstery fabric (generous amount)
    *   Wood glue
    *   Wood screws
    *   T-nuts and hanger bolts (for legs)
    *   Ottoman legs (pre-made or custom)
    *   Thread (matching fabric)

Selecting quality materials ensures your ottoman lasts. I always choose the best fabric I can afford. It makes a big difference in the look and feel. Think about the fabric's durability and cleanability. Some fabrics resist stains better. This is key for a piece that gets regular use.

## Building the Ottoman Base Structure

The base is the skeleton of your round ottoman. It needs to be sturdy. I start by cutting two large circles from ¾-inch plywood or MDF. These will be the top and bottom of the base. To get perfect circles, use a string and pencil attached to a nail in the center. Mark your desired diameter. Then, carefully cut along this line with a jigsaw or circular saw. Remember to use safety glasses.

Next, create the side support. This can be one long piece of flexible plywood or several smaller, straight pieces of ½-inch plywood cut to form a circle. I prefer using one long, thin piece if possible. This makes a cleaner curve. The height of this side piece determines your ottoman's overall height, excluding foam and legs. Attach the side pieces securely between the top and bottom circles using wood glue and screws. Pre-drilling pilot holes prevents wood from splitting.

### Reinforcing the Wooden Frame

A strong frame prevents wobbling. Once the basic cylinder is formed, add internal supports. I cut smaller wood blocks or vertical strips. These fit inside the cylinder, connecting the top and bottom circles. Space them evenly around the circumference. This provides extra rigidity. This step is especially important if your ottoman will be used for sitting or as a coffee table.

You can also consider adding a central support. A vertical dowel or small piece of wood in the middle offers more stability. Apply wood glue to all joining surfaces. Use clamps to hold pieces while screws are driven in. Allow the glue to dry completely before moving on to the next step. A solid base makes for a durable ottoman. This foundation work ensures your ottoman stands up to daily use.

## Adding Comfort: Foam and Batting

Now that the base is strong, it's time to make your ottoman comfortable. This involves adding foam and batting. I start with high-density foam. The foam should be cut to the exact size of your ottoman top. If your foam is too thin, you can layer two pieces. Use a utility knife or electric carving knife to cut the foam. Make sure the edges are clean. This foam provides the main support for sitting or resting feet.

Attach the foam to the top of your wooden base. You can use spray adhesive for this. Apply it to both the wood and the bottom of the foam. Press the foam down firmly. Ensure it aligns perfectly with the wooden top. This creates a solid, comfortable surface.

### Wrapping with Batting for Softness

Once the foam is in place, add polyester batting. Batting adds a softer layer over the foam. It also helps smooth out any imperfections. It gives the ottoman a fuller, rounder shape. I typically use two or three layers of batting. Wrap the batting completely around the foam top and down the sides of the wooden base.

Pull the batting taut and secure it to the underside of the wooden base using your staple gun. Work your way around the ottoman, pulling the batting smoothly. Overlap the batting slightly at the seam. Trim any excess. The batting should be snug but not too tight. It needs to provide a plush feel. This step is crucial for both comfort and the final upholstered look. Getting this smooth ensures a professional finish.

## Fabric Selection and Cutting for Upholstery

Choosing the right fabric is fun. It sets the tone for your whole room. I always pick upholstery-grade fabric. It lasts longer. Consider the color, pattern, and texture. Think about how it matches your existing decor. Do you want a bold statement or something subtle? If the ottoman might get heavy use, choose a durable, easy-to-clean fabric. Velvet feels luxurious, while linen is more casual.

To measure fabric, drape it over your foam-covered ottoman. Allow for enough fabric to cover the top, sides, and reach several inches under the bottom of the wooden base for stapling. Add extra for any pleats or folds. For a simple round ottoman, you will need a large square or circular piece for the top. You will also need a long rectangular strip for the sides. I always buy a little extra fabric, just in case.

### Cutting Your Fabric Pieces

Cutting fabric needs care. Lay your fabric flat on a large surface. Make sure it is smooth. For the top, place your ottoman (foam side down) onto the fabric. Trace around the base, adding 6-8 inches extra all around for pulling and stapling. This creates your top circle. Cut it out with fabric scissors.

For the side piece, measure the circumference of your ottoman base. This is the length of your side fabric. The height should be the height of your ottoman (foam + wood) plus 6-8 inches for stapling at the top and bottom. Cut this long rectangle. If your fabric is not wide enough for one continuous piece, you may need to sew two or more pieces together. Use a strong seam. This precision in cutting sets you up for successful upholstery.

## Upholstering Your Round Ottoman

This is where your ottoman starts to look like furniture. Lay your large circular fabric piece face down on the floor. Center your batting and foam-covered ottoman on top of it. Pull the fabric up and over the foam. Start by stapling the fabric to the wooden base on two opposite sides. Use a few staples to hold it in place. Then, do the same on the other two opposite sides. This helps keep the fabric centered.

Now, work your way around the ottoman. Pull the fabric taut. Staple it every few inches to the underside of the wooden base. For a smooth finish, you need to manage the excess fabric around the curve. This is often done by creating pleats or gathers. Form small, neat pleats every few inches. Fold the excess fabric in evenly. Secure each pleat with a staple. Continue this process until the entire top is covered smoothly.

### Attaching the Side Fabric

Next, take your long rectangular side fabric piece. Start at the back of the ottoman. Align the top edge of the fabric with the top edge of the ottoman (where the foam meets the side). Staple it securely along the top edge of the wooden base. Work your way around, pulling the fabric tight. When you reach the starting point, overlap the fabric by an inch or two. Fold under the raw edge of the top piece to create a clean seam. Stitch it or use fabric glue to secure it.

Now, pull the bottom edge of the side fabric down. Staple it to the underside of the wooden base. Again, pull it taut and work your way around. This step ensures a tight, clean look. Trim any excess fabric close to the staples.

Your ottoman is almost finished!

## Adding Legs and Finishing Touches

With your ottoman upholstered, it's time to add the legs. Legs provide stability and lift the ottoman off the floor. This makes it look finished. Most pre-made ottoman legs come with hanger bolts. You will need to install T-nuts into the bottom of your wooden base. Decide where you want the legs to be. Mark four equally spaced points around the circumference of the bottom. Drill pilot holes for the T-nuts at these marks.

Insert the T-nuts into the pilot holes. Tap them with a hammer until they are flush with the wood. Then, simply screw the hanger bolts of your legs into the T-nuts. Hand-tighten them firmly. Check that all legs are secure and the ottoman sits level. If one leg is slightly shorter, you can add a small felt pad under it to adjust.

### Final Inspection and Care

Once the legs are on, stand back and admire your work. Give your ottoman a final inspection. Check for any loose staples or uneven fabric. Trim any stray threads. You can add felt glides to the bottom of the legs. This protects your floors from scratches. It also helps the ottoman slide easily.

Consider the care of your new ottoman. If you chose a washable fabric, great! Otherwise, plan for spot cleaning. Regular vacuuming helps keep dust off. With proper care, your DIY round ottoman will last for many years. It is a functional and beautiful addition to your home.

## Customizing and Decorating Your Ottoman

Now that you have built your round ottoman, you can personalize it further. Custom touches make it truly yours. One popular option is adding decorative trim. You can glue or staple gimp trim or decorative cord along the top and bottom edges of the side fabric. This hides staples and gives a more polished look. I find trim adds a lot of elegance.

Tufting is another way to add visual interest. This involves pulling fabric through the foam and base with a long needle and securing it with buttons. This creates dimples and a classic upholstered look. You can create a simple central tuft or a pattern of multiple tufts. It changes the whole feel of the ottoman.

### Functional Uses and Styling Tips

Your new round ottoman is versatile. Use it as a comfortable footrest after a long day. It also works as extra seating when guests visit. It is perfect for small gatherings. You can even use it as a coffee table. Place a large tray on top to hold drinks or books. This makes it a central piece in your living room.

When styling your ottoman, think about balance. If your ottoman is a bold color, keep other elements in the room more subdued. If it is neutral, add colorful throw pillows or blankets nearby. An ottoman can anchor a seating area. It adds a soft element to a room filled with hard surfaces. You can learn more about how to make your ottoman serve as a coffee table by reading [how to use an ottoman as a coffee table](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-an-ottoman-as-a-coffee-table). Consider placing it in front of a sofa or between two armchairs. Your round ottoman is now a proud part of your home decor.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much fabric do I need for a round ottoman?
The amount of fabric depends on your ottoman's size. For a typical 24-inch diameter, 18-inch high ottoman, plan for about 2.5 to 3 yards of 54-inch wide upholstery fabric. This allows for the top, side, and stapling allowance. Always add a little extra to be safe.

### What is the best foam for an ottoman?
High-density foam, also known as upholstery foam, is best. It offers firm support and durability. A density of 1.8 to 2.2 pounds per cubic foot works well. Thickness from 3 to 6 inches is common for comfort. It ensures your ottoman keeps its shape.

### Can I make a storage ottoman using this method?
Yes, you can adapt this method for a storage ottoman. Instead of a solid top, create a hinged lid for the top wooden circle. The base structure would be the same, but the inside would remain hollow. This lets you store blankets or other items. You can find more specific instructions on [how to turn a regular ottoman into a storage ottoman](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-a-regular-ottoman-into-a-storage-ottoman).

### How do I choose the right size for my round ottoman?
Consider the space it will occupy and its primary use. For a footrest, it should be comfortable for your leg length. For a coffee table, ensure it is the right height compared to your sofa. A good rule is to have it 1-2 inches shorter than your sofa seat height. Measure your available floor space carefully.

### What kind of wood is best for the ottoman base?
Plywood or MDF are excellent choices for the base. ¾-inch thickness is ideal for the top and bottom circles for strength. ½-inch flexible plywood works well for the curved sides. Both materials are stable and take screws and glue well. They provide a solid foundation.

### Is it hard to upholster a round shape?
Upholstering a round shape can be challenging due to managing fabric around curves. Creating neat pleats or gathers is key. Take your time, pull the fabric evenly, and use plenty of staples. With patience, you can achieve a smooth, professional finish. Practice on scrap fabric if you are unsure.
