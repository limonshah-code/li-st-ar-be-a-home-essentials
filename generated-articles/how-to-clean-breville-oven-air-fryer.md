### How to Clean Breville Oven Air Fryer

## Why Cleaning Your Breville Oven Air Fryer Matters

Keeping your Breville oven air fryer clean is not just about looks. A clean air fryer performs better. Food cooks evenly when heating elements are clear. Air flows freely, which is essential for air frying. Dirty parts block this airflow.

Here is what you will need:

*   **Soft Cloths or Microfiber Towels:** These are gentle on surfaces. They prevent scratches.
*   **Warm Water:** It helps loosen grease and food bits.
*   **Mild Dish Soap:** Use a gentle soap that breaks down grease. Avoid harsh chemicals.
*   **Non-abrasive Sponge or Brush:** For scrubbing stubborn spots without damage.
*   **Baking Soda:** A natural cleaner for tough grease or burnt-on food.
*   **White Vinegar:** Helps cut through grease and remove odors.
*   **Spray Bottle:** Useful for applying vinegar or water mixtures.
*   **Paper Towels:** For drying surfaces or quick clean-ups.

Avoid using steel wool pads or abrasive cleaners. These can scratch or damage the non-stick coatings and stainless steel finishes. Always check your Breville owner's manual for specific cleaning advice. Following these guidelines will keep your Breville oven air fryer in top condition.

## Daily Cleaning Routine for Your Breville Oven Air Fryer

Regular cleaning prevents large messes. A quick clean after each use saves time later. This daily routine focuses on the most used parts. It stops food and grease from sticking. This simple practice will help you [keep your Breville air fryer clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-breville-air-fryer-clean) for a long time.

### Wiping Down After Use

Let your Breville oven air fryer cool down completely after you finish cooking. Unplug it from the power outlet. Use a damp soft cloth with a tiny bit of mild dish soap. Wipe the interior surfaces gently. This removes any fresh food splatters or grease.

You can also wipe the exterior surfaces. This keeps the outside looking good. Make sure to dry all surfaces thoroughly. This prevents water spots and rust.

### Emptying the Crumb Tray

The crumb tray catches crumbs and drips during cooking. You should empty it after every use. Pull out the crumb tray from the bottom of your Breville oven air fryer. Shake out any loose crumbs into the trash. Wash the tray with warm, soapy water.

Use a brush to clean off any stuck-on bits. Rinse it well and let it dry completely before putting it back. This simple step stops crumbs from burning and causing smells. It also keeps your appliance hygienic.

## Deep Cleaning the Interior of Your Breville Oven Air Fryer

Over time, grease and food can build up inside your Breville oven air fryer. Daily wipes might not remove all of it. A deep clean helps you tackle these stubborn spots. This process restores your appliance's cleanliness and cooking performance. This is especially important for the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer models. You can find more specific tips for a full clean in our guide on [how to deep clean Breville air fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-deep-clean-breville-air-fryer).

### Cleaning the Oven Walls and Door

First, unplug your air fryer and let it cool down fully. Remove all racks, trays, and the air fryer basket. You can make a paste using baking soda and a little water. Spread this paste over the stubborn grease spots on the interior walls and oven door. Let the paste sit for about 15-20 minutes.

This helps to loosen the baked-on grime. After waiting, use a damp, non-abrasive sponge or cloth to scrub the areas gently. You might need to rinse and repeat for very tough spots. Wipe away all baking soda residue with a clean, damp cloth. Then, dry the surfaces completely. For more detailed instructions on cleaning the inside of your specific model, refer to our article on [how to clean inside of Breville air fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-inside-of-breville-air-fryer).

### Tackling the Heating Elements

The heating elements are fragile. You must clean them carefully. Do not use water or cleaning solutions directly on them. Food residue can stick to these elements. This causes smoke and odd smells during cooking.

Use a soft, dry cloth or a soft brush to gently wipe away any loose debris. If there are stubborn spots, you can use a slightly damp cloth with very diluted mild soap. Make sure the cloth is only damp, not wet. Do not press hard on the elements. Allow them to air dry completely before you use the appliance again. Never submerge these parts in water.

## Cleaning Your Breville Oven Air Fryer Accessories

The accessories of your Breville oven air fryer get the dirtiest. They directly contact your food. Cleaning them well ensures hygiene and cooking performance. This includes the air fryer basket, racks, and baking pans.

### Cleaning the Air Fryer Basket

The air fryer basket often gets greasy and has stuck-on food. After each use, remove the basket. Let it cool down. Wash it with warm water and mild dish soap. Use a non-abrasive sponge or a soft brush to scrub away food residue. For really tough spots, you can soak the basket in hot soapy water for 15-30 minutes.

This helps loosen baked-on grease. After scrubbing, rinse the basket thoroughly. Let it air dry or wipe it dry with a clean cloth. It is important to know if you can put your specific Breville air fryer basket in the dishwasher. Some models have dishwasher-safe baskets, others do not.

### Washing Racks and Pans

Your Breville oven air fryer comes with various racks and a baking pan. These also need regular cleaning. Remove them from the oven after it cools. Wash them in your sink with warm, soapy water.

Use a non-abrasive sponge to clean off any food or grease. For stubborn stains, a mixture of baking soda and water can help. Apply the paste, let it sit, then scrub and rinse. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Dry the racks and pans completely before placing them back into the oven. Proper cleaning of these parts prevents smoke and keeps your food tasting good.

## Maintaining the Exterior of Your Breville Oven Air Fryer

The outside of your Breville oven air fryer also needs care. Keeping the exterior clean makes your appliance look good. It also helps with general kitchen hygiene. This is a quick and simple step in your cleaning routine.

Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe down the exterior surfaces. You can add a small amount of mild dish soap to the cloth. Wipe away fingerprints, dust, and any splashes. Be careful around the control panel. Do not let water drip into the buttons or display. Finish by wiping with a clean, dry cloth. This removes any streaks and leaves a polished look. Regular exterior cleaning helps your Breville air fryer blend nicely with your kitchen decor.

## Tips for Keeping Your Breville Oven Air Fryer Clean Longer

Prevention is key to an easy cleaning process. A few simple habits can greatly reduce the amount of cleaning needed for your Breville oven air fryer. These tips help you maintain your appliance better. They extend the time between deep cleans.

*   **Use Parchment Paper or Foil Liners:** Place a sheet of parchment paper or aluminum foil in the bottom of the air fryer basket or pan before cooking. This catches drips and crumbs. Make sure the liner does not block the airflow or touch the heating elements. Only use foil if your Breville model allows it safely.
*   **Pre-Spray Cooking Oil:** Lightly spray your air fryer basket or rack with cooking oil before adding food. This makes it harder for food to stick. Cleaning becomes much easier.
*   **Clean Up Spills Immediately:** If food spills or splatters during cooking, let the appliance cool. Then, wipe the spill quickly. Fresh spills are easier to clean than dried-on messes.
*   **Store Properly:** If you store your Breville oven air fryer, cover it with a cloth. This protects it from dust and kitchen grease.
*   **Regular Light Cleaning:** Do not wait for a huge mess. A quick wipe-down after each use makes a big difference. This prevents grease and food from baking onto surfaces.
