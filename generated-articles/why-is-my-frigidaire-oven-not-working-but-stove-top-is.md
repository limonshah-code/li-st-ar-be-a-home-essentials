## Frigidaire Oven Not Working? The Stove Top Still Works!

It is frustrating when your kitchen appliances act up. One moment you are planning a delicious meal, and the next, your Frigidaire oven is not working, but the stove top is fine. This common issue can put a quick stop to baking or roasting plans. Understanding why your oven fails while the burners operate can save you time and money.

I know this situation can feel puzzling, but there are clear reasons behind it. The oven and stove top, while part of the same unit, often use separate components for heating. This means a problem with one does not always affect the other. This guide will help you understand the specific parts involved and how to troubleshoot them. We will cover common power issues, heating element failures, sensor problems, and control board malfunctions. By the end, you will have a clear path to diagnose and possibly fix your Frigidaire oven.

### Why Your Frigidaire Oven Isn't Heating While the Stove Top Functions

Your Frigidaire oven is not working but the stove top is because the oven and stove top often use separate power circuits or heating components. Common culprits include a tripped breaker affecting only the oven, a failed bake or broil heating element, a malfunctioning temperature sensor, a blown thermal fuse, or a faulty electronic control board.

## Checking Power Supply and Circuit Breaker for Oven Issues

When your Frigidaire oven is not working but the stove top is, the very first step is to check the power supply. While your burners are operational, it does not mean the oven is receiving proper power. Ovens, especially electric ones, sometimes operate on a different circuit or require a dedicated power leg that might be interrupted. I always start here because it is a simple fix that costs nothing.

Look at your home's circuit breaker panel. You are looking for a breaker that is tripped. A tripped breaker usually sits halfway between the "on" and "off" positions, or it might be fully in the "off" position. If you find one, flip it completely to the "off" position first, then firmly flip it back to the "on" position. This resets the circuit and can restore power to your oven. Sometimes, the oven has its own dedicated breaker, separate from the rest of the range. Check all the breakers. If the breaker trips again immediately, it suggests a deeper electrical problem that needs professional attention. You might have a short circuit somewhere within the oven's electrical system.

A loose wire connection at the wall outlet or the terminal block behind the range can also cause power problems. For safety, always unplug the range before checking these connections. The terminal block is where your oven connects to your home's electrical wiring. Over time, these connections can loosen, leading to intermittent power or no power to specific components like the oven. Ensuring these connections are tight and secure is important. If you find any burnt or frayed wires, do not attempt to fix them yourself. You need a qualified electrician or appliance repair technician for safe repair. Proper power flow is essential for oven function.

## Inspecting the Heating Elements (Electric Frigidaire Ovens)

If your electric Frigidaire oven is not working but the stove top is, the heating elements are often the cause. Electric ovens typically have two main heating elements: the bake element at the bottom and the broil element at the top. These elements are responsible for producing the heat needed to cook food. If either one or both fail, your oven will not heat up properly. I always check these elements carefully.

Start with a visual inspection of both the bake and broil elements. Look for any visible signs of damage. This often appears as a break, a blister, or a burnt spot on the metal coil. If an element looks damaged, it likely needs replacement. A broken element means the electrical circuit is interrupted, preventing it from heating. Even if an element looks fine, it might still be faulty internally. You can test them for continuity with a multimeter, but a visual check is a good first step. A healthy element should show continuity.

Replacing a faulty heating element is a common DIY repair. First, ensure the oven is completely unplugged or the power is turned off at the circuit breaker. Remove any racks inside the oven. Unscrew the mounting screws that hold the element in place. Gently pull the element forward a few inches to expose the electrical terminals. Carefully disconnect the wires, making sure they do not retract into the oven wall. Connect the wires to the new element, slide it back into place, and secure it with the screws. Remember, working with electrical components requires caution. If you feel unsure, a professional can handle this task for you.

## The Role of the Oven Temperature Sensor and Thermal Fuse

When your Frigidaire oven is not working but the stove top still functions, the oven temperature sensor or the thermal fuse might be to blame. These components are vital for safe and accurate oven operation. I often find issues with these parts during troubleshooting. A malfunctioning sensor or a tripped fuse will prevent the oven from heating up.

The oven temperature sensor, often located inside the oven cavity, monitors the internal temperature. It sends this information to the oven's control board. If the sensor is faulty, it can send incorrect temperature readings. This can cause the oven to either not heat at all, overheat, or maintain an inaccurate temperature. A common symptom of a bad sensor is the oven not reaching the set temperature or never turning on its heating elements. You can usually test a temperature sensor's resistance with a multimeter. The resistance should change predictably with temperature variations. If it does not, the sensor needs replacement. Sometimes, the sensor itself is physically damaged or has a loose connection. You can check the sensor at the back of the oven, typically secured by a screw. Unplug the oven before inspection.

The thermal fuse is a safety device designed to protect the oven from overheating. If the oven's internal temperature exceeds a safe limit, the thermal fuse will blow, cutting off power to the oven's heating circuit. This is a non-resettable fuse, meaning once it blows, it must be replaced. A blown thermal fuse often results in a completely dead oven, even if the stove top works fine. This fuse is usually located behind the back panel of the range, near the oven cavity or the control board. If your oven repeatedly blows the thermal fuse, it indicates a more serious underlying problem, such as a faulty cooling fan or a problem with the temperature control system. Do not just replace the fuse without investigating the cause of the overheating.

## Investigating the Oven Igniter (Gas Frigidaire Ovens)

For those with a gas Frigidaire oven not working but the stove top still igniting, the oven igniter is often the culprit. Unlike electric ovens that use elements, gas ovens rely on an igniter to light the gas. The stove top burners have their own separate igniters, which explains why they can work perfectly while the oven does not. I know how puzzling this can be for gas appliance owners.

The oven igniter does more than just spark the gas. It also acts as a safety device, ensuring that gas flows only when the igniter is hot enough to combust it. When you turn on your gas oven, the igniter glows hot for several seconds. This heat creates a path for the electrical current. If the igniter does not get hot enough or is too weak, it will not signal the gas valve to open, and no gas will flow to be ignited. You might hear a clicking sound but no gas smell, or you might smell gas without ignition.

To check your oven igniter, first, make sure the gas supply to the range is off and the oven is unplugged. The bake igniter is usually located near the bottom, under the floor of the oven. The broil igniter is near the top. Turn on the oven and observe the igniter through the bottom grate or a small window if available. A healthy igniter should glow brightly orange within 30-60 seconds. If it glows faintly, or not at all, it is likely weak or faulty and needs replacement. If you have a gas oven that works but does not heat up, this is a very strong indicator of a failing igniter.

## Troubleshooting the Electronic Control Board

The electronic control board is the brain of your Frigidaire oven. If your Frigidaire oven is not working but the stove top is fine, a faulty control board could be the reason. This board manages all oven functions, including temperature regulation, cycle times, and element activation. A problem with the control board can prevent signals from reaching the heating elements or gas valve, even if those components are in good condition. I have seen many cases where the control board was the root cause of seemingly complex oven issues.

Symptoms of a failing control board can vary. Your oven might not turn on at all, or it might display erratic behavior. You might see error codes appear on the display, or the oven might heat to the wrong temperature. Sometimes, the oven lights might work, or the display shows a time, but nothing else happens when you try to preheat. If you have ruled out power issues, bad heating elements, or a faulty igniter, the control board becomes a strong suspect. For example, specific error codes on Frigidaire ovens often point directly to control board communication issues or component failures it controls. If your oven keeps beeping with an F10 code, that often signals a specific control problem: [Why Does My Frigidaire Oven Keep Beeping F10](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-oven-keep-beeping-f10).

Troubleshooting the control board yourself is complex and generally not recommended for the average homeowner. It involves checking electrical signals and could damage other components if done incorrectly. You might look for visible signs of damage on the board itself, such as burnt components or corrosion. However, even if it looks fine, it could still be internally faulty. If you suspect the control board, it is often best to consult a certified appliance technician. They have the tools and expertise to properly diagnose the board and replace it if necessary. Control board replacements can be expensive, so accurate diagnosis is crucial.

## Other Potential Causes and Professional Help

Even after checking the common issues, your Frigidaire oven might still not be working but the stove top is. There are a few less common but equally important possibilities to consider. Sometimes, the problem lies with components that are harder to access or diagnose without specialized tools. I always recommend exhausting the simple fixes first, but knowing when to call a professional is key.

One possibility is a faulty wiring harness. Over time, wires can become loose, corroded, or even chewed by pests. A damaged wire running to a specific oven component, like an element or the temperature sensor, would prevent that part from working. This would leave the stove top unaffected. Visual inspection for loose or burnt wires, particularly around heating elements and the control board, is important. However, tracing every wire can be time-consuming and difficult. Another less common issue is a defective oven selector switch or thermostat. While integrated into the control board on many modern models, older Frigidaire ovens might have a separate mechanical switch that fails to send power to the oven functions.

If you have gone through all the troubleshooting steps—checking the circuit breaker, inspecting heating elements, testing the temperature sensor, confirming the igniter (for gas models), and briefly considering the control board—and your oven still will not heat, it is time to call in the experts. Appliance technicians have diagnostic tools that can pinpoint exact component failures, and they can safely handle electrical and gas connections. They also have access to genuine replacement parts and often provide warranties on their repairs. Attempting complex electrical or gas repairs yourself can be dangerous and could lead to further damage to your appliance or even personal injury. Remember, your safety is the most important consideration. Maintaining your Frigidaire electric range properly, including regular cleaning, can also help prevent future issues and extend its life: [How to Clean Frigidaire Electric Range](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-frigidaire-electric-range).

## Maintaining Your Frigidaire Range for Longevity

Maintaining your Frigidaire range is crucial for preventing future issues like your oven not working while the stove top does. Regular care and simple habits can significantly extend the life of your appliance. I always stress the importance of proactive maintenance. A little effort now saves a lot of hassle and expense later.

First, regular cleaning is vital. Food spills and grease buildup can interfere with heating elements, sensors, and even wiring over time. Clean your stove top after each use. For electric stove tops, promptly wipe up spills to prevent them from burning on. You can find useful tips for keeping your electric stove top clean and functional: [How to Clean Electric Stove Top](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-electric-stove-top). For the oven interior, aim for a thorough cleaning every few months or as needed. Baked-on residue can sometimes smoke or cause uneven heating. Make sure to clean the bottom of your oven properly, as grease and food debris can collect there: [How to Clean Bottom of Oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bottom-of-oven).

Beyond cleaning, gentle handling is important. Avoid slamming the oven door, as this can affect door switches or internal wiring. Be careful not to spill liquids into the control panel, which can damage the electronic board. Periodically check the oven door seal (gasket) for wear and tear. A damaged seal allows heat to escape, making the oven less efficient and potentially causing components to overwork. If you notice any unusual smells, sounds, or error codes, address them promptly. Do not ignore minor issues, as they can escalate into major problems. Consulting your owner's manual for specific maintenance recommendations for your Frigidaire model is always a good idea. This proactive approach helps ensure your entire range, both oven and stove top, remains in excellent working condition for years to come.
