## Fixing Your KitchenAid Dishwasher When It Won't Drain

Imagine loading your KitchenAid dishwasher, running a cycle, and later finding standing water at the bottom. This can be very frustrating. A KitchenAid dishwasher that won't drain stops your cleaning process. It also means dirty dishes remain inside. This common problem often has simple fixes you can do yourself. You do not always need a technician. I understand the annoyance this causes in your home. This guide will help you understand why your KitchenAid dishwasher won't drain. We will provide clear steps to get it working properly again.

### Takeaway

**Why won't my KitchenAid dishwasher drain?** Your KitchenAid dishwasher might not drain due to a clogged filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, a dirty air gap, or issues with your garbage disposal. Less common causes include a faulty drain pump or problems with the drain valve or control board. Most issues are simple to fix with basic tools.

## Common Reasons Your KitchenAid Dishwasher Won't Drain

Understanding why your KitchenAid dishwasher won't drain helps you fix it faster. Several issues can stop your dishwasher from draining properly. Most common problems involve blockages. These blockages prevent water from leaving the tub. It is important to check these common areas first. This can save you time and money.

### Clogged Dishwasher Filter

This is the most common reason for drainage issues. Food particles, grease, and debris accumulate in the filter. Over time, this buildup restricts water flow. Your KitchenAid dishwasher has a filter system designed to catch these items. If it gets too full, water cannot pass through it. This causes water to pool in the tub. Regular cleaning of this filter is crucial.

### Kinked or Clogged Drain Hose

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. This hose can become kinked behind the dishwasher or under the sink. A sharp bend stops water flow. Additionally, food debris or grease can build up inside the hose. This creates a blockage. Check the entire length of the hose for any obstructions.

### Clogged Air Gap

Some KitchenAid dishwashers use an air gap device on the sink. This device prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It is a small cylinder on your countertop, near the faucet. The air gap can get clogged with food particles. If this happens, water cannot exit the dishwasher properly. You will see water backing up in the sink or the air gap itself.

### Garbage Disposal Connection

Many dishwashers drain into a garbage disposal. If the disposal is full of food waste, it can block the dishwasher's drain line. Run your garbage disposal before starting a dishwasher cycle. Also, when a new garbage disposal is installed, a knockout plug must be removed. If this plug is not removed, the dishwasher will not drain. This is a common oversight during new installations.

### Faulty Drain Pump

The drain pump is a motor that pushes water out of the dishwasher. If the pump fails, water will remain in the tub. You might hear humming noises but no water movement. Sometimes, small items like broken glass or fruit pits can get stuck in the pump impeller. This prevents the pump from spinning. A faulty pump often requires replacement.

These are the main culprits when your KitchenAid dishwasher fails to drain. Start your troubleshooting with these common problems. They are often the easiest to fix. This organized approach helps you pinpoint the exact issue.

## Troubleshooting a Clogged KitchenAid Dishwasher Filter

A clogged filter is the most frequent culprit behind a KitchenAid dishwasher that won't drain. Regularly cleaning this filter keeps your dishwasher working efficiently. This process is straightforward and does not require special tools. You can easily do it yourself in minutes. I make it a point to clean mine once a month.

To start, make sure your dishwasher is off. Unplug it from the power outlet. This prevents any accidental starts during cleaning. You do not want any power while reaching into the wet tub. Safety is always important when working with appliances.

Inside the bottom of your dishwasher, you will find the filter assembly. KitchenAid dishwashers typically have a two-part or three-part filter system. It often includes a coarse filter and a fine filter. There might also be a cylindrical screen. Refer to your owner's manual for the exact location and removal steps. Most filters twist and lift out.

Remove the coarse filter first. This is usually a larger piece that sits at the bottom. Then, you can usually twist and pull out the fine mesh filter or cylinder. Some models require you to lift a tab or turn a handle to release them. Be gentle as you remove the parts.

Once you have the filter parts, take them to your sink. Rinse them under warm running water. Use a soft brush or sponge to scrub away any food debris, grease, or grime. I often use a little dish soap to help break down stubborn grease. Make sure to clean all the nooks and crannies. You want the mesh to be completely clear of blockages.

Inspect the filter for any damage. If you see cracks or tears, you might need a replacement. A damaged filter cannot properly trap food particles. This could lead to other issues. Clean all parts thoroughly until they are spotless.

After cleaning, carefully put the filter assembly back into your dishwasher. Ensure all parts are correctly aligned. Twist or lock them into place securely. You should feel them snap or click into position. A loose filter can cause problems. It might vibrate during cycles or not filter properly. Once the filter is clean and back in place, restore power to the dishwasher. Run a quick rinse cycle to check the drainage. You should see the water drain completely now. This simple step often solves the "KitchenAid dishwasher won't drain" problem. For more detailed instructions, you can check out this guide on [how to clean dishwasher filter and drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-and-drain).

## Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose on Your KitchenAid

If your KitchenAid dishwasher still won't drain after checking the filter, the next step is to examine the drain hose. The drain hose carries wastewater out of the dishwasher. Issues with this hose are common causes of drainage problems. It can get kinked or clogged. Checking it requires pulling the dishwasher out or looking under the sink.

First, turn off power to your KitchenAid dishwasher. Unplug it from the wall outlet. If it is hardwired, turn off the circuit breaker. This is a safety step you should always follow. You will be working near electrical components and water. Do not skip this step.

Locate the drain hose. It typically connects from the back of the dishwasher to the sink drain or garbage disposal. It often runs through a cabinet under the sink. Check the entire length of the hose for any visible kinks or sharp bends. These kinks act like damns, stopping water flow. Gently straighten any kinks you find. Ensure the hose has a gentle, upward slope. This helps prevent backflow.

Sometimes, the blockage is inside the hose itself. Food particles, grease, or even small foreign objects can build up. Disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink/disposal. Place a towel underneath to catch any residual water. Have a bucket ready as well.

Once disconnected, inspect both ends of the hose for blockages. You can try to clear minor clogs by blowing through the hose. For more stubborn clogs, use a long, flexible brush. A plumber's snake can also work. Push the brush or snake through the hose to dislodge any debris. You will be surprised what can get stuck in there. I once found a corn cob piece blocking mine.

Rinse the hose with warm water to flush out any remaining debris. Make sure water flows freely through it. This confirms the hose is clear. After cleaning, reconnect the drain hose securely. Ensure all clamps are tight. Proper installation prevents leaks. Always make sure the hose forms a high loop. This loop prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into your dishwasher. Many building codes require this.

If the hose is damaged or severely clogged, consider replacing it. A new drain hose is relatively inexpensive. Replacing it is easier than trying to un-clog a deeply impacted one. After reconnecting everything, restore power to your KitchenAid dishwasher. Run a short test cycle. Observe if the water drains completely now. This process helps fix your KitchenAid dishwasher not draining. For general tips, you can refer to [how to get the dishwasher to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain).

## Checking Your KitchenAid Dishwasher's Air Gap and Sink Drain

If your KitchenAid dishwasher still won't drain after addressing the filter and drain hose, the air gap or sink drain might be the problem. Many KitchenAid models use an air gap. It is a small, cylindrical fixture on your kitchen countertop. It helps prevent contaminated sink water from flowing back into your dishwasher. This is a vital safety feature.

Start by locating the air gap. It usually sits next to your kitchen faucet. You might see water bubbling or spilling from it when the dishwasher tries to drain. This is a clear sign of a clog. To access it, unscrew or pop off the decorative cap. Lift off the inner cap.

You will see two hoses connected to the air gap's base. One hose comes from the dishwasher. The other hose goes to the garbage disposal or sink drain. Use a paper towel or a small cloth to wipe away any visible debris. Often, food particles and grease collect here. These block the water flow. I often find rice grains or coffee grounds stuck there.

For stubborn clogs, you might need a small brush or a thin wire. Gently push it down into the openings of the air gap. Work carefully to dislodge any blockages. Flush it with water from your sink faucet. Ensure water flows freely through it. Reassemble the air gap once it is clean. Make sure both hoses are connected tightly.

Next, examine your sink drain. If your dishwasher drains into the sink plumbing, a clogged sink drain can cause the dishwasher to back up. Run water in your sink to see if it drains slowly. If it does, the sink drain needs clearing. You can use a plunger or a drain cleaner for the sink. Never use chemical drain cleaners in the dishwasher itself.

If your KitchenAid dishwasher is connected to a garbage disposal, check it as well. A full or clogged disposal will stop your dishwasher from draining. Run the disposal for about 30 seconds with water. This clears any food waste. Always run the disposal before using your dishwasher. This ensures a clear path for drainage.

Also, for new garbage disposal installations, a knockout plug must be removed. This plug is inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet. If you recently installed a new disposal and your dishwasher stopped draining, this is likely the issue. Disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Use a screwdriver or punch to remove the plug. Reconnect the hose securely.

Addressing issues with your air gap or sink drain can often resolve the "KitchenAid dishwasher won't drain" problem. These components are part of the drainage pathway. Keeping them clear is essential. After clearing, run a test cycle on your dishwasher. Ensure proper drainage.

## Understanding Your KitchenAid Dishwasher's Drain Pump

If you have checked the filter, drain hose, air gap, and garbage disposal, and your KitchenAid dishwasher still won't drain, the problem might be the drain pump. The drain pump is a crucial component. It is responsible for forcibly pushing the wastewater out of the dishwasher. Without a working pump, water simply sits in the tub.

You can often diagnose a faulty drain pump by listening. When the dishwasher reaches the drain cycle, listen for sounds. A working pump makes a distinct whirring noise. If you hear a loud grinding, buzzing, or no noise at all, the pump might be failing. Sometimes, a foreign object gets lodged in the pump's impeller. This can prevent it from spinning. Small pieces of glass, pits, or even a twist tie can jam it.

Accessing the drain pump requires some effort. The pump is usually located under the dishwasher, beneath the tub. You will need to pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet space. First, turn off the power to your dishwasher. Unplug it from the wall outlet or flip the circuit breaker. Shut off the water supply valve as well.

Tilt the dishwasher onto its back or side for access. Place towels underneath to catch any water. You will see a housing unit, which contains the drain pump. It is typically attached to the bottom of the tub with clamps or screws. Disconnect the electrical wires leading to the pump. Then, remove the hoses connected to the pump.

Once the pump is removed, inspect the impeller. The impeller is a small fan-like component inside the pump. It pushes the water. Check for any obstructions. Carefully remove anything you find. Be gentle, as impellers can be brittle. I have heard stories of people finding earrings or small toy pieces stuck in there.

If the impeller is clear but the pump does not respond, it might be faulty. You can test the pump's continuity with a multimeter. This checks if electrical current flows through it. If there is no continuity, the motor is likely burnt out. In such cases, the drain pump needs replacement. This is a more complex repair.

Replacing a drain pump involves carefully removing the old one and installing a new one. Ensure you get the correct part number for your KitchenAid model. Connect all hoses and wires correctly. Secure the pump housing. Once replaced, slide the dishwasher back into place. Reconnect power and water. Run a test cycle to confirm proper drainage. This step can be challenging. If you are not comfortable with it, consider calling a professional. They can address [when dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/when-dishwasher-does-not-drain) efficiently.

## Advanced Troubleshooting: Drain Valve and Sensor Problems

When simpler fixes do not work, your KitchenAid dishwasher not draining could be due to a faulty drain valve or a malfunctioning sensor. These issues are less common but still possible. They require a bit more technical understanding to diagnose and fix. It's important to approach these carefully.

### Drain Valve Malfunction

The drain valve controls the flow of water out of the dishwasher. It opens when the drain pump activates. If the valve sticks or fails to open, water cannot exit. You might hear the drain pump working, but no water moves. The drain valve is often part of the drain pump assembly. Or it is located near it.

To check the drain valve, you first need to access the bottom of your dishwasher. This means turning off power and water. Then, pull the dishwasher out and tilt it. The drain valve might be visible as a small component near the drain pump. It often has wires connected to it. Check for any visible obstructions preventing it from opening. Sometimes, a spring might be broken, or the solenoid might fail.

You can test the solenoid with a multimeter to ensure it gets power and functions. If it does not receive power or does not open, it might need replacement. This often requires replacing the entire drain pump assembly, as the valve is integrated. This is a more involved repair.

### Malfunctioning Sensors or Control Board

Modern KitchenAid dishwashers have sensors. These sensors detect water levels and the completion of cycles. If a sensor malfunctions, it might not signal the dishwasher to drain. For example, a clogged float switch can prevent the drain cycle from starting. The float switch tells the dishwasher when the water level is too high. If it gets stuck in the "high water" position, the dishwasher thinks it is full and will not drain.

You can usually find the float switch at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is a small plastic cup or rod that floats up with water. Check if it moves freely. Clean around it to ensure no debris jams it. Make sure it can go down when the water drains. If it is stuck, it will keep sending a "water present" signal.

A more serious issue is a faulty control board. The control board is the "brain" of your dishwasher. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump and valve. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the signal to drain. You might notice other irregular behavior too. This could include wrong cycle times or error codes.

Diagnosing a control board issue is complex. It often requires specific diagnostic tools. You would need to check for power to components, then trace signals. If the control board is the problem, it needs replacement. This is usually a costly repair. It is best left to a professional technician. They can accurately diagnose and replace control board issues. Always exhaust simpler troubleshooting steps before considering control board replacement.

## When to Call a Professional for Your KitchenAid Dishwasher

Sometimes, even with all your efforts, your KitchenAid dishwasher still won't drain. You have cleaned the filter, checked the hose, cleared the air gap, and confirmed the garbage disposal is fine. You have even looked at the drain pump. At this point, it's smart to consider professional help. Knowing when to call a technician can save you time and prevent further damage.

If you have gone through all the troubleshooting steps mentioned and the problem persists, it is a sign the issue is more complex. You might be dealing with an internal electrical fault. It could also be a major component failure. These components could be the main control board, a difficult-to-access drain valve, or a deeply stuck object. I know from experience, sometimes it's better to let an expert handle it.

A professional appliance technician has specialized tools and diagnostic equipment. They can quickly identify the root cause of the problem. They have the knowledge to safely access and test internal components. They can also get specific replacement parts. These parts might not be available to the average consumer. They also know the specific quirks of KitchenAid appliances.

Consider calling a professional if:

*   **You cannot locate the source of the blockage.** Some clogs are deep within the plumbing system or internal parts.
*   **The drain pump needs replacement.** While some DIYers replace pumps, it can be tricky. Incorrect installation can lead to leaks or further damage.
*   **You suspect an electrical issue or control board problem.** Working with electricity can be dangerous. Diagnosing control board faults requires expertise.
*   **You lack the necessary tools or confidence.** Do not force repairs. This can cause more expensive damage.
*   **Your dishwasher is showing error codes related to draining.** These codes often point to specific internal component failures. A technician can interpret them.
*   **The dishwasher is under warranty.** Attempting DIY repairs on a warranted appliance might void your warranty. Check your warranty terms first.

Before calling, have your dishwasher's model and serial number ready. Describe the symptoms clearly. Tell them what steps you have already tried. This information helps the technician prepare. It can make the service call more efficient. Investing in a professional repair can often extend the life of your KitchenAid dishwasher. It also ensures it drains properly for many more years.

## Preventing Future KitchenAid Dishwasher Drain Problems

Prevention is always better than cure. Once you have fixed your KitchenAid dishwasher not draining, you will want to keep it that way. Regular maintenance helps prevent future clogs and operational issues. These simple habits can extend the life of your appliance. They also ensure trouble-free dishwashing.

### Scrape Dishes Before Loading

This is the most effective preventative measure. Scrape large food particles off plates before loading them into the dishwasher. You do not need to pre-rinse or wash dishes. Just remove solid chunks of food. This prevents them from accumulating in the filter or drain pump. Smaller particles are fine for the dishwasher. Larger ones are problematic.

### Clean the Dishwasher Filter Regularly

Make it a habit to clean your KitchenAid dishwasher's filter often. I clean mine at least once a month. If you use your dishwasher daily or wash very dirty dishes, clean it more frequently. Refer to the section "Troubleshooting a Clogged KitchenAid Dishwasher Filter" for detailed steps. This quick cleaning step prevents most drain issues. It also improves wash performance.

### Run Your Garbage Disposal Before Dishwasher Use

If your KitchenAid dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, always run the disposal first. Make sure it is completely clear of food waste. This ensures an unobstructed path for the dishwasher's wastewater. Running the disposal clears any lingering food particles. This prevents them from backing up into the dishwasher drain hose.

### Use the Right Detergent and Quantity

Use high-quality dishwasher detergent. Avoid too much detergent. Too much can create excessive suds. These suds can interfere with draining. They can also leave a residue. Using too little detergent can lead to food residue not being fully washed away. This can then clog filters. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for detergent quantity.

### Perform Monthly Dishwasher Cleaning Cycles

Once a month, run an empty hot water cycle with a dishwasher cleaner. You can use a dedicated dishwasher cleaner, white vinegar, or baking soda. Place a cup of white vinegar in a dishwasher-safe bowl on the top rack. Run a hot cycle. This helps remove grease and mineral buildup. It cleans internal components. This keeps the drain system clear.

### Check Drain Hose and Air Gap Periodically

Every few months, visually inspect the drain hose for kinks. Ensure it maintains a high loop if installed above the drain connection. If you have an air gap, quickly check it for debris. A quick check can prevent major clogs later. These are simple inspections that take minutes.

By following these preventative tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of your KitchenAid dishwasher not draining. Regular care keeps your appliance performing at its best. It helps you avoid frustrating breakdowns. A little maintenance goes a long way. This ensures your kitchen stays efficient and clean.
