## Why Formaldehyde Was Used in Carpet Glue

Formaldehyde served several key purposes in older carpet adhesives. Manufacturers valued it for its effectiveness. It helped glues perform better and last longer. Understanding these reasons helps us see why its use was so widespread.

One main reason was its excellent bonding capability. Formaldehyde resins create very strong bonds. This ensures the carpet stays firmly attached to the subfloor. It resisted wear and tear effectively. For a long-lasting flooring solution, this was a significant advantage. The adhesive needed to endure foot traffic and cleaning.

Another purpose was its role as a preservative. Formaldehyde prevented bacterial and fungal growth. This was important for the glue itself. It extended the shelf life of the product. It also helped protect the carpet once installed. This reduced the risk of mold or mildew forming under the flooring.

It also contributed to the overall strength and curing process. Formaldehyde resins helped glues dry and harden properly. This meant installations were quicker and more reliable. These properties made it a go-to chemical for many years. Despite its benefits, awareness grew about its health impacts. This led to calls for change.

The industry began exploring alternatives. They sought compounds that could offer similar benefits. These new compounds needed to have a safer profile. This journey continues today. Manufacturers aim to balance performance with safety.

## Health Implications of Formaldehyde Exposure from Carpet Adhesives

Exposure to formaldehyde can affect human health in various ways. The severity depends on the concentration and duration of exposure. When formaldehyde off-gasses from carpet glue, it enters your breathing air. This can cause immediate and long-term health concerns.

Short-term exposure often irritates the eyes, nose, and throat. You might experience watery eyes or a burning sensation. Some people get a cough or wheezing. Skin contact can cause irritation. These symptoms are usually mild but uncomfortable. They often lessen once you leave the exposed area.

For individuals with asthma or allergies, formaldehyde can trigger symptoms. It can worsen respiratory conditions. Children and the elderly are often more sensitive to its effects. Their developing or compromised immune systems react more strongly. So, good air quality is especially important for them.

Long-term exposure is a greater concern. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies formaldehyde as a human carcinogen. This means it can cause cancer. Specifically, it links to nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia. This risk applies to prolonged, higher-level exposures.

Reducing your exposure is therefore important. This includes selecting low-formaldehyde products. It also means ensuring good ventilation during and after installation.
