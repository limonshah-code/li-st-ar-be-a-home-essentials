## Maintaining Your New Floors: Tips for Longevity

Investing in new flooring is a big decision. Proper maintenance protects that investment. It keeps your floors looking new for many years. Don Pascoe Carpet Barn Tile House provides guidance on floor care. We want your floors to last. Different flooring types require specific cleaning methods.

For carpets, regular vacuuming is essential. It removes dirt and dust before they settle deep into the fibers. For best results, vacuum high-traffic areas several times a week. Use a vacuum cleaner with strong suction and a good brush roll. Address spills immediately. Blot them gently with a clean cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain. Professional carpet cleaning every 12-18 months is recommended. This helps remove embedded dirt and revitalizes the carpet fibers.

Tile floors are generally easy to maintain. Sweep or vacuum regularly to remove loose dirt and grit. Mop with a mild, pH-neutral cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers. These can damage grout or tile surfaces. Pay attention to grout lines. They can collect dirt and become discolored. Use a grout brush and a specialized cleaner if needed. Proper sealing of grout can also prevent staining. This keeps your tile floors looking pristine.

Hardwood floors need careful attention. Sweep or vacuum with a soft brush attachment daily. This prevents scratches from grit. Use a hardwood floor cleaner specifically designed for your finish. Damp mop, do not wet mop. Excess water can damage wood. Place mats at entryways to trap dirt. Use furniture pads under legs to prevent dents. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or waxes on modern finishes. Always follow the manufacturer's care instructions.

Laminate and vinyl floors are quite resilient. Sweep or vacuum regularly to remove debris. Clean spills immediately with a damp cloth. Use a laminate or vinyl-specific floor cleaner. Avoid excessive water, especially on laminate. Do not use abrasive cleaners, steel wool, or wax. These can damage the protective layer. A damp mop is usually sufficient for these durable surfaces.

### General Floor Care Tips

*   **Use Doormats:** Place mats at all entryways. This traps dirt and moisture before it enters your home.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Sweep, vacuum, or mop regularly. This prevents dirt buildup.
*   **Address Spills Immediately:** Clean up spills as soon as they happen. This prevents staining.
*   **Use Proper Cleaners:** Always use cleaning products recommended for your specific floor type.
*   **Protect Furniture:** Place felt pads under furniture legs. This prevents scratches and dents.
*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Stay away from abrasive cleaners or excessive water on most floors.
