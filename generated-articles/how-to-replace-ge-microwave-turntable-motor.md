## Diagnosing a Faulty GE Microwave Turntable Motor

You may wonder if your turntable motor is truly broken. Several clear signs point to a faulty GE microwave turntable motor. The most common sign is the turntable simply not spinning during operation. You might hear the microwave running, but the plate stays still. This prevents your food from heating evenly.

Another symptom is unusual noises coming from under the turntable. You might hear grinding, buzzing, or whirring sounds. These noises suggest the motor's gears or internal components are failing. Sometimes, the turntable might spin intermittently or struggle to turn. This also indicates the motor is weakening.

Before assuming the motor is bad, check other possibilities. Ensure the turntable plate sits correctly on its support ring. Also, check that the turntable coupler is not broken. The coupler is the small plastic piece that connects the motor shaft to the glass tray. If the coupler is broken, the motor spins but the tray does not. You can also listen closely to the motor area for any motor sounds. If you hear a hum but no movement, the motor likely has seized.

## Safety First: Preparing for Your GE Microwave Repair

Working on any appliance requires attention to safety. This is especially true for microwaves. Microwaves contain a high-voltage capacitor. This component can store a dangerous electrical charge even after the unit is unplugged. This stored charge can cause a severe shock. Therefore, proper safety steps are critical.

Always unplug your GE microwave from the wall outlet before you begin any work. This removes power to the unit. Next, you should wait a few minutes for any residual charge to dissipate. For maximum safety, you might consider discharging the capacitor. This requires specific knowledge and tools, like a screwdriver with an insulated handle and a bleeder resistor. If you are not comfortable with this step, just avoid touching the capacitor. The capacitor looks like a large cylinder or rectangular box.

Gather all your necessary tools. You will typically need a Phillips head screwdriver. You might also need a Torx screwdriver, depending on your GE microwave model. Needle-nose pliers can help with disconnecting wires. A multimeter is useful for testing, but not always required for a simple motor swap. Having the new GE microwave turntable motor ready is also important. Ensure it is the correct part for your specific model.

## Accessing the GE Microwave Turntable Motor

The first step in replacing the motor is gaining access to it. The turntable motor is usually located on the bottom of the microwave. It might be inside the main casing or under a separate metal plate. Most GE microwaves require you to remove the entire outer shell to reach the motor.

Start by placing your microwave on a stable, flat surface. Ensure you have enough clear space to work. Look for screws on the back and sides of the microwave. These screws hold the outer metal casing in place. Use the appropriate screwdriver, either Phillips or Torx, to remove these screws. Keep the screws in a safe place so you do not lose them.

Once all screws are removed, carefully slide the outer casing off. It usually slides backward or lifts upwards. Be gentle as you remove the casing. Do not force it. You might need to gently pry it open if it feels stuck. After removing the casing, you will see the internal components of your GE microwave. The turntable motor is typically a small, cylindrical or rectangular component. It will be located directly beneath where the glass turntable sits. Sometimes, it is covered by a small metal plate secured by more screws. Remove this plate if present.

## Removing the Old GE Turntable Motor

With the microwave casing open, you can now focus on the old turntable motor. The motor sits in a mounting bracket. It has a shaft that extends up through the base of the microwave. This shaft connects to the turntable coupler. Take a moment to observe how the motor is positioned. This will help you install the new one correctly.

The motor connects to the microwave's electrical system with two wires. These wires usually attach with spade connectors. Use your needle-nose pliers to gently pull these connectors off the motor terminals. Pull on the connector itself, not the wire. This prevents damage to the wiring. Some motors might have a plastic plug connector instead of individual spade connectors. If so, simply unclip the plug.

Next, you must detach the motor from its mounting. Most GE turntable motors are held in place by two or three screws. Use your screwdriver to remove these screws. Once the screws are out, the motor should be free. Some motors might twist into place or use clips. If so, carefully rotate the motor or depress any clips to release it. Once loose, carefully pull the old motor out. Make a mental note of its orientation and how the wires were connected. This makes installing the new part easier.

## Installing the New GE Microwave Turntable Motor

Now that the old motor is out, you are ready to install the new GE microwave turntable motor. First, confirm the new motor is the correct replacement part for your specific GE microwave model. You can usually find the model number inside the microwave door frame. Match this number when ordering parts. Installing a part designed for other brands, like replacing an [LG microwave turntable motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-microwave-turntable-motor), [Whirlpool microwave turntable motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-whirlpool-microwave-turntable-motor), or a [Frigidaire microwave turntable motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-frigidaire-microwave-turntable-motor), may not work due to different specifications or mounting.

Take the new motor and align it with the mounting bracket. The screw holes on the motor should match the holes in the microwave's base. Insert and tighten the screws to secure the new motor firmly in place. Do not overtighten, but ensure the motor does not wiggle. The motor shaft should point upwards, ready to engage with the turntable coupler.

Reconnect the electrical wires to the new motor. Most motors have two terminals. It usually does not matter which wire goes to which terminal for these simple AC motors. Push the spade connectors firmly onto the motor terminals. If your microwave uses a plastic plug, simply push it onto the corresponding receptacle on the new motor. Double-check all connections to ensure they are secure. Loose connections can prevent the motor from working or cause electrical issues.

## Reassembling and Testing Your GE Microwave

With the new GE microwave turntable motor installed and secured, it is time to put your appliance back together. This step is crucial for both safety and functionality. First, if you removed any internal metal plates to access the motor, screw them back into place. Ensure all internal wires are tucked away safely. They should not get pinched by the outer casing.

Carefully slide the outer metal casing back onto the microwave. Make sure it aligns properly with the microwave frame. You might need to gently push or slide it until it clicks into place. Once the casing is seated correctly, reinsert all the screws you removed earlier. Tighten them firmly, but avoid overtightening. Overtightening can strip the screw threads or crack the casing. Check all sides and the back to make sure all screws are in.

After reassembly, your GE microwave is ready for a test. Plug the microwave back into a grounded wall outlet. Place a cup of water on the glass turntable tray inside the microwave. Close the door firmly. Set the microwave for a short duration, about 30 seconds to one minute. Press "start" and observe the turntable. It should now spin smoothly and consistently. If it spins, your repair was successful. If it does not spin, unplug the microwave and recheck your connections. You might need to troubleshoot further.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues After GE Microwave Motor Replacement

Sometimes, after replacing the GE microwave turntable motor, you might still encounter issues. Do not worry; this is not uncommon. One frequent problem is the turntable still not spinning. First, double-check all electrical connections to the new motor. Ensure they are fully seated and secure. A loose wire can prevent the motor from receiving power. Also, confirm the turntable coupler is correctly attached to the motor shaft and not broken itself. Sometimes, a new motor can be faulty, though this is rare.

Another issue could be the microwave not turning on at all after reassembly. This usually indicates a different problem, possibly caused during the repair process. Check if the microwave is properly plugged into the outlet. Ensure the outlet itself has power. You might also want to check the internal fuse. Some GE microwaves have an internal fuse that blows to protect components from power surges. Learning [how to replace a fuse in a GE microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-fuse-in-ge-microwave) could solve this.

Lastly, if your microwave starts but does not heat, the problem is not the turntable motor. Issues like not heating typically relate to the magnetron, diode, or capacitor. If the door does not register as closed, the microwave will not start. The door switches may need checking.
