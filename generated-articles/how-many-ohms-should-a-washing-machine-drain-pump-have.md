## What Ohms Should Your Washing Machine Drain Pump Read?

Have you ever wondered why your washing machine won't drain? A common culprit is a faulty drain pump. Understanding the electrical resistance, measured in ohms, of your washing machine drain pump is key to diagnosing problems. This guide helps you identify typical ohm readings. We show you how to test your pump with a multimeter and interpret the results. Knowing this helps you determine if a repair or replacement is necessary. Let's get your laundry routine back on track.

**Takeaway:**
*   A healthy washing machine drain pump typically reads between **5 and 20 ohms**.
*   Readings outside this range, or no reading at all, often signal a faulty pump.
*   Always use a multimeter to test resistance with the appliance unplugged.
*   Confirm specific ohm ranges with your washing machine's service manual.

**A washing machine drain pump should typically read between 5 and 20 ohms when tested with a multimeter.** This range indicates proper electrical continuity and a functional motor winding. Exact specifications vary by brand and model. Always check your washing machine's service manual for the precise ohm range specific to your drain pump.

## Understanding Washing Machine Drain Pump Resistance

Your washing machine drain pump works by using an electric motor. This motor creates the force to push water out of the drum. The motor has coils of wire inside it, called windings. Electrical resistance is a measure of how much these windings oppose the flow of electric current. We measure this resistance in units called ohms.

When you measure the ohms of your drain pump, you are checking the health of these motor windings. A healthy motor allows current to flow within a specific range. This specific range helps the motor work correctly. If the resistance is too high, current struggles to pass. If it is too low, too much current flows. Both extremes can cause the pump to fail. Knowing the correct ohm range is important for troubleshooting.

Think of it like checking your car's tire pressure. There's an ideal range for safe driving. Similarly, there's an ideal ohm range for your drain pump's motor. This ensures it functions efficiently and without overheating. We use a tool called a multimeter to check this resistance. It gives us a numerical value for the pump's electrical health. This simple test helps us pinpoint problems quickly.

### Why Ohm Readings Matter for Your Drain Pump

Ohm readings tell us about the internal electrical health of the pump motor. A correct reading means the motor windings are intact. They are also free from shorts or breaks. If the reading is too high, it suggests a broken winding or poor connection. This prevents the motor from getting enough power.

A reading that is too low indicates a short circuit within the motor. A short circuit causes excessive current flow. This can quickly damage the pump or other electrical components. In either case, the pump will not operate correctly. It might not spin at all, or it might struggle to move water. This makes your washing machine unable to complete its drain cycle.

By checking the ohms, you can often confirm a faulty drain pump. This test saves you time and money. You avoid replacing parts that are still working. This diagnostic step is a crucial part of proper appliance maintenance. It helps you keep your washing machine running well.

## Typical Ohms Readings for Drain Pumps

The standard ohm reading for a functional washing machine drain pump typically falls between **5 and 20 ohms**. This is a general guideline for most residential washing machine models. However, pump specifications can vary significantly among brands and models. For example, a drain pump for a top-loading machine might have a slightly different range than one for a front-loader. High-efficiency models might also have unique requirements.

For the most accurate information, you should always consult your washing machine's service manual. This manual provides the precise ohm specification for your particular drain pump. If you do not have the manual, look for it online using your washing machine's model number. Manufacturer websites often host these documents. Sometimes, a quick search for "\[your brand] washing machine drain pump ohms" can also yield helpful results.

Different brands, like LG, Samsung, Whirlpool, or GE, design their components with specific electrical properties. What is normal for a [Whirlpool washing machine drain pump](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-washing-machine-drain) might differ slightly from a [GE washing machine drain pump](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/ge-washing-machine-wont-drain). Ignoring these specific ranges can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Always aim for precision when troubleshooting appliance issues.

### Brand-Specific Ohm Ranges

While the 5-20 ohm range is a good starting point, some brands may have slightly different expectations. For instance:

*   **Whirlpool/Maytag:** Many models often fall comfortably within the 8-15 ohm range.
*   **LG/Samsung:** These brands might have pumps that lean towards the lower end, sometimes in the 5-10 ohm range.
*   **GE/Kenmore:** Their pumps often show readings consistent with the general 5-20 ohm window.

These are general observations. Always remember that the model number is your best friend for accurate data. A universal drain pump might also have a specific range listed on its packaging. Comparing your reading to the correct specification is the only way to confirm pump health. This step is critical for effective repairs.

## How to Test Your Washing Machine Drain Pump

Testing your washing machine drain pump for electrical resistance is a straightforward process. You will need a multimeter, a basic electrical testing tool. Before you begin, safety is paramount. Always ensure the washing machine is completely disconnected from power. Unplug it from the wall outlet to prevent electric shock.

First, locate the drain pump. It is usually at the bottom front of the machine. You might need to remove a lower access panel or tilt the machine back. Once located, identify the electrical connectors attached to the pump. These are typically two wires leading to a plastic connector. Disconnect these wires from the pump terminals.

Set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. If your multimeter has multiple ohm ranges, start with a lower one, like 200 or 2k (2000) ohms. Touch the multimeter probes to the two metal terminals on the drain pump. It does not matter which probe goes on which terminal for this test. The multimeter display will show a numerical reading. This reading is the electrical resistance in ohms.

Record the reading you get. Compare this value to the manufacturer's specified ohm range for your washing machine drain pump. If the reading falls within the correct range, the motor windings are likely good. If the reading is significantly outside the range, or shows "OL" (overload/open loop) or zero, the pump is likely faulty. This process applies to many different appliances, such as how you might test the [ohms of a dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-many-ohms-should-a-dishwasher-drain-pump-have).

### Step-by-Step Drain Pump Testing

Let's break down the process into clear, actionable steps:

1.  **Safety First:** Unplug the washing machine from the electrical outlet. Turn off the water supply to the machine.
2.  **Access the Pump:**
    *   For most front-load machines, open the lower access panel at the front.
    *   For some top-load machines, you might need to tilt the machine back or remove the front panel.
    *   Have a shallow pan and towels ready to catch any residual water.
3.  **Locate Electrical Connections:** Find the two wires connecting to the drain pump. They usually terminate in a plastic connector.
4.  **Disconnect Wires:** Carefully disconnect the electrical connector from the pump. You might need to press a tab or squeeze clips.
5.  **Prepare Multimeter:**
    *   Set your multimeter to measure resistance (ohms, indicated by Ω).
    *   Choose a suitable range, usually 200 ohms or 2k ohms.
6.  **Test Resistance:**
    *   Touch one multimeter probe to each of the two metal terminals on the drain pump itself.
    *   Hold the probes steady until the reading stabilizes on the multimeter display.
7.  **Record and Interpret:** Note the ohm reading. Compare it to the specified range in your washing machine's service manual.

If you are dealing with a washing machine that isn't draining, like an [LG washing machine that won't drain](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/why-lg-washing-machine-wont-drain), this test is a crucial diagnostic step.

## Interpreting Ohm Readings: What They Mean

Once you have an ohm reading from your washing machine drain pump, you need to understand what it tells you. The reading helps you determine if the pump's electrical motor is working as it should. There are three main scenarios you might encounter: a reading within the normal range, an open circuit, or a short circuit. Each scenario points to a different issue or confirms proper function.

**Normal Range (e.g., 5-20 ohms):** If your multimeter displays a reading within the manufacturer's specified range (typically 5-20 ohms), this is good news. It indicates that the pump's motor windings are intact and have proper electrical continuity. The electrical part of your pump is likely functional. If the washing machine is still not draining, the problem lies elsewhere. You might need to check for blockages in the drain hose or filter. The impeller could also be broken, even if the motor works.

**Open Circuit (OL or infinite resistance):** An "OL" (Over Load) reading, or a very high number (like 1 on many multimeters that means "open"), signifies an open circuit. This means there is a break in the pump's motor windings. Electricity cannot flow through the motor. This is like a broken wire. When this happens, the pump motor will not run at all. This reading almost always indicates a faulty drain pump that requires replacement.

**Short Circuit (0 or very low ohms):** A reading of 0 ohms or very close to it (e.g., 1 or 2 ohms) indicates a short circuit. This means electricity is taking a path it should not, bypassing resistance. A short can cause the motor to draw too much current. This can trip circuit breakers or damage the appliance's control board. A shorted drain pump is also faulty and needs to be replaced.

Understanding these readings helps you pinpoint the exact problem. This knowledge saves you from unnecessary repairs or part replacements.

### What to Do with Your Readings

*   **Normal Reading:** If the ohms are good, check for mechanical issues. This includes debris in the pump, a clogged drain hose, or a faulty impeller. Sometimes, your washing machine might not drain due to issues like a kinked hose or a clogged filter. If you have an [LG washing machine that won't drain](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-lg-washing-machine-to-drain), first check the simple mechanical parts.
*   **Open Circuit (OL):** The pump motor is electrically dead. You will need to replace the drain pump.
*   **Short Circuit (0-2 ohms):** The pump motor is electrically damaged. You will need to replace the drain pump.

This diagnostic step confirms if the electrical winding is the issue. If it is, pump replacement is the next step.

## Common Causes of Drain Pump Failure

While incorrect ohm readings directly point to an electrical motor failure, many other factors can cause a washing machine drain pump to fail. Understanding these helps you prevent future issues. It also aids in troubleshooting when your washing machine isn't draining. Some problems are mechanical, while others involve wear and tear.

One of the most frequent causes is **debris accumulation**. Small items like coins, buttons, hair, lint, or even socks can bypass the filter. These items then get lodged in the drain pump's impeller. The impeller is the part that spins to push water out. When it's blocked, it cannot spin freely. This can strain the motor or prevent water from draining, even if the motor itself is electrically sound. Regularly cleaning your pump filter helps prevent this.

**Wear and tear** is another common issue. Drain pumps have moving parts. Over years of use, these parts, such as bearings or seals, can wear out. Worn bearings can cause the impeller to wobble or seize. Damaged seals can lead to leaks. Eventually, the pump simply loses its ability to function effectively. This is particularly true for older washing machines that have seen heavy use.

**Electrical faults**, as identified by ohm testing, are directly related to the motor windings. Over time, insulation around the wires can degrade. This can lead to short circuits. Or, the windings themselves can break, causing an open circuit. Voltage fluctuations or power surges can also damage the delicate motor components. This type of failure often results in the pump not receiving any power or burning out.

### Other Factors Affecting Drain Pump Health

*   **Overloading the Washer:** Consistently overloading your washing machine puts extra strain on all components, including the drain pump. The pump has to work harder to push a larger volume of water. This can accelerate wear and tear.
*   **Chemical Damage:** Harsh detergents or excessive use of bleach can corrode plastic and rubber components within the pump over time. This can lead to leaks or mechanical failures.
*   **Improper Installation:** If the drain hose has kinks or is improperly routed, it creates back pressure. This makes the pump work harder than it should. Ensuring the hose is installed correctly helps the pump operate efficiently. If your washing machine cannot drain upwards, it puts additional stress on the pump, which can be seen in issues like a [washing machine drain up failure](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-a-washing-machine-drain-up).

Understanding these diverse causes helps you approach troubleshooting more comprehensively. It also informs your maintenance practices.

## When to Replace Your Drain Pump vs. Repair

Deciding whether to replace your washing machine drain pump or attempt a repair often comes down to the type of fault and the cost involved. Ohm testing is a primary diagnostic tool in this decision. If your multimeter shows an open circuit (OL) or a short circuit (0-2 ohms), the motor's internal windings are faulty. In such cases, repair is rarely an option. Motor windings are not typically user-serviceable. Replacing the entire pump assembly is almost always the necessary course of action.

If the ohm reading is within the normal range, but the pump is still not draining water, the issue is likely mechanical. Common mechanical problems include:

*   **Clogged Impeller:** Debris such as coins, lint, or small fabric items can jam the impeller.
*   **Broken Impeller Blades:** The plastic blades of the impeller can break or crack, making it unable to push water.
*   **Worn Bearings:** The bearings that allow the impeller to spin smoothly can wear out.

In some rare cases, if you can access the impeller, clear a blockage, or replace a specific, easily removable part (like a filter housing), a repair might be possible. However, most drain pumps are sealed units. The labor and parts cost to repair internal mechanical components often exceed the cost of a new pump. For example, replacing a [GE washing machine drain pump](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-ge-washing-machine-drain-pump) or a [Miele washing machine drain pump](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-miele-washing-machine-drain-pump) is usually straightforward.

### Making the Replacement Decision

Consider these points when deciding:

*   **Cost of New Pump:** Drain pumps typically range from $50 to $150. This is an affordable repair for most washing machines.
*   **Age of Appliance:** If your washing machine is very old and approaching the end of its lifespan, investing in a new pump might not be worthwhile. You might consider replacing the entire appliance instead.
*   **Your Skill Level:** Replacing a drain pump is a moderately difficult DIY task. If you are comfortable with basic tools and electrical safety, it is achievable. If not, professional help might be needed, adding to the cost.
*   **Availability of Parts:** Specific pump components for repair are often hard to find. A complete pump assembly is readily available.

Ultimately, if the electrical motor windings are bad (incorrect ohm reading), replace the pump. If it is a simple blockage, clear it. For other mechanical failures within a sealed pump, replacement is usually the most practical and cost-effective solution. This helps you efficiently fix issues like [why your Whirlpool washing machine won't drain](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-washing-machine-drain).

## Maintenance Tips for Your Washing Machine Drain Pump

Proper maintenance can significantly extend the life of your washing machine drain pump and prevent many common failures. A well-maintained pump ensures your washing machine drains efficiently and avoids costly repairs. Regular checks and simple habits make a big difference.

One of the most important maintenance tasks is **regularly cleaning the drain pump filter**. Most washing machines, especially front-loaders, have a small filter or coin trap located near the drain pump. This filter catches lint, coins, buttons, and other small items before they reach the pump impeller. I recommend checking and cleaning this filter every few months, or more often if you frequently wash heavily soiled items or pet bedding. To clean it, first unplug the machine and place a shallow pan and towels under the filter access point. Slowly unscrew the cap to let water drain, then remove and clean the filter thoroughly.

**Avoid overloading your washing machine.** Overfilling the drum forces the pump to work harder to move a larger volume of water. This extra strain can lead to premature wear and tear on the pump motor and impeller. Stick to the recommended load sizes specified in your washing machine manual. Distribute clothes evenly to maintain balance during cycles.

**Check pockets before washing.** This simple habit is incredibly effective. Items like coins, keys, hairpins, and small toys are major culprits for pump blockages. Taking a moment to empty pockets saves your pump from potential damage. You can also place small, delicate items in mesh laundry bags. This prevents them from escaping into the drain system.

### Additional Pump Care Tips

*   **Use the Right Detergent:** Use high-efficiency (HE) detergent if your machine requires it. Regular detergent creates too many suds. Excessive suds can hinder proper draining and put strain on the pump.
*   **Inspect Drain Hoses:** Periodically check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. A kinked hose restricts water flow and makes the pump work harder. Ensure it is properly installed and not twisted.
*   **Run a Cleaning Cycle:** Many modern washing machines have a "clean washer" or "tub clean" cycle. This cycle uses hot water and sometimes a cleaning agent to flush out residue and build-up. Running this cycle monthly helps keep the entire drain system, including the pump, clear. This helps prevent issues that cause problems with drainage, such as [how to drain water in your Whirlpool washing machine](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-water-in-whirlpool-washing-machine) if it has residual water.

By following these maintenance tips, you can significantly prolong the life of your washing machine drain pump. You will also minimize the chances of facing drainage issues.
