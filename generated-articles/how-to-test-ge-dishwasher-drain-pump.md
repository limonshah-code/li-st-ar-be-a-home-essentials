## Test Your GE Dishwasher Drain Pump: A DIY Guide

My dishwasher stopped draining properly. It is a common problem for many people. If you own a GE dishwasher, you might face a similar issue. When your dishwasher does not drain, the drain pump is often the main suspect. Testing this part helps you find the problem. It saves time and money. This guide shows you how to test your GE dishwasher drain pump. I cover everything from safety steps to electrical checks. We will get your dishwasher working right again.

### Takeaway:

*   **Safety First:** Always disconnect power before starting any work.
*   **Locate Pump:** Access the drain pump from the front or by pulling the dishwasher out.
*   **Inspect Visually:** Check for clogs and debris around the impeller.
*   **Electrical Test:** Use a multimeter to check for continuity and correct resistance (ohms).
*   **Interpret Results:** Understand what the readings tell you about the pump's condition.

You can test a GE dishwasher drain pump by first checking for clogs, then visually inspecting the pump. Next, use a multimeter to check for continuity and proper resistance (ohms) to determine if electrical failure is causing drainage issues. This process helps you diagnose the problem accurately and decide on the next steps for repair.

### Understanding Your GE Dishwasher's Drainage System

A GE dishwasher drain pump moves water out of the machine. It is a vital part of the dishwasher's operation. When the wash cycle finishes, the pump activates. It sends the dirty water through the drain hose. The water then goes into your home's drainage system. If this pump fails, water will sit in the bottom of your dishwasher. This is a clear sign something is wrong.

Common signs of a failing drain pump include standing water after a cycle. You might also hear unusual noises during the drain cycle. Sometimes, the dishwasher does not even try to drain. It just stops. This often means the pump is not getting power or is seized. Remember, a clogged filter or a blocked drain hose can also stop water from draining. But the pump often takes the blame first. We need to check all parts. Getting your dishwasher to drain correctly is important. You can find more tips on [how to get the dishwasher to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain). Many factors contribute to drainage issues. If your [dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/when-dishwasher-does-not-drain), the pump is a good place to start.

### Safety First: Preparing for the Drain Pump Test

Before touching any appliance parts, safety is the first step. You are working with electricity and water. This combination can be dangerous. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher first. Find the circuit breaker for your kitchen. Flip it to the "off" position. This stops electricity from reaching the dishwasher. I always double-check the power is off. Pull the dishwasher out slightly and make sure no power is running through the outlet.

Gather your tools next. You will need a multimeter for electrical tests. A Phillips screwdriver and a nut driver are helpful. Have some towels and a shallow pan or bucket ready. Water might spill when you disconnect hoses. Protecting your floor is a good idea. Lastly, you might need to manually drain the remaining water. Learn [how to drain dishwasher water manually](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-dishwasher-water-manually) if your tub is full. This prevents a big mess.

### Locating and Accessing the GE Dishwasher Drain Pump

Finding the drain pump is the next step. On most GE dishwasher models, the drain pump is at the bottom. It is often located near the front of the dishwasher. You will typically find it under the wash tub. Sometimes, it is hidden behind a kickplate. This kickplate is the panel at the very bottom front of your dishwasher. You usually need to remove a few screws to take it off.

To get a clear view, you might need to pull the dishwasher out of its cabinet. This often means removing mounting screws. These screws are usually under the countertop or on the sides of the cabinet opening. Once you remove the screws, gently pull the dishwasher forward. Be careful not to strain the water lines or electrical cord. The drain pump itself is usually a round component. It has wires connected to it and a drain hose attached. It sits right where the water collects at the bottom. Knowing [how to clean a dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-pump) sometimes involves these same access steps. This process is similar to how you might access a drain pump in other large appliances, like when you [replace a GE washing machine drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-ge-washing-machine-drain-pump).

### Visual Inspection and Clearing Obstructions

After accessing the drain pump, the first check is a visual one. Look closely at the pump impeller. The impeller is like a small fan inside the pump. It pushes water out. Foreign objects often get caught here. I have seen food particles, broken glass, or even small plastic pieces. These can stop the impeller from spinning. Remove any debris you find. Use pliers or your fingers if possible. Be careful if there is broken glass.

Next, check the drain hose connected to the pump. This hose carries water away from the dishwasher. Look for any visible kinks or blockages. Sometimes, the hose itself gets crushed or bent. This restricts water flow. You might need to disconnect the hose from the pump and from the house drain. Look through it with a flashlight. Clear any clogs inside. This step is often overlooked, but it is simple. It can solve many drainage problems without needing electrical tests. Learning [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain) is also part of this visual check. A clear path is essential for water flow.

### Electrical Testing of Your GE Dishwasher Drain Pump

Visual checks are important, but sometimes the problem is electrical. This is where your multimeter comes in. A multimeter measures electrical properties. We will use it to check the pump's health. First, ensure the dishwasher is still unplugged. Safety is always the top priority. Disconnect the electrical wires from the drain pump terminals. Take a photo before you disconnect them. This helps you reconnect them correctly later.

#### Checking for Continuity

Continuity means a complete electrical path. If a circuit has continuity, electricity can flow through it. Set your multimeter to the continuity setting. This setting often looks like a speaker symbol or a diode symbol. It usually beeps when there is continuity. Touch one probe to each of the pump's electrical terminals. If the multimeter beeps or shows a reading of "0" or close to "0" ohms, there is continuity. This means the pump's internal wiring is intact. If it shows "OL" (open line) or does not beep, the circuit is broken. The pump has an internal electrical fault. This indicates a bad pump.

#### Measuring Resistance (Ohms)

Resistance is how much a component opposes electrical current. This test gives a better picture of the pump's health. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Î©) setting. The range might be 200 or 2K. Touch one probe to each of the pump's electrical terminals. A good GE dishwasher drain pump usually shows a specific resistance reading. This reading varies by model, but it is often between 5 and 20 ohms. You should check your dishwasher's service manual for the exact specification. This is the most accurate way to know. If the reading is "OL" (open line), the circuit is open. The pump is definitely bad. If the reading is very low, like 0.1 ohms, it might indicate a short circuit. This also means the pump is faulty. Understanding [how many ohms should a dishwasher drain pump have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-many-ohms-should-a-dishwasher-drain-pump-have) is key to this test. These electrical tests are similar to how you would [test a GE refrigerator water inlet valve](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-ge-refrigerator-water-inlet-valve). The principles of multimeter use apply across many appliance components.

### Understanding Your Test Results and Next Steps

You have completed the visual and electrical tests. Now, let us interpret the results. If your visual inspection showed clogs, clearing them might have fixed the problem. Reassemble the dishwasher and run a test cycle. If the pump showed good continuity and a correct ohm reading, your drain pump is likely fine. The problem might be elsewhere. Consider checking the drain hose for hidden blockages. Ensure your air gap (if present) is clear. A faulty control board could also be the culprit. You can also learn [how to test a GE dishwasher user interface board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-ge-dishwasher-user-interface-board) for other electrical issues.

If your electrical tests showed no continuity or an incorrect ohm reading, the drain pump is faulty. It needs replacement. A broken pump cannot be repaired. It is often more cost-effective to replace the whole unit. Replacement parts are readily available online. Be sure to get the correct part number for your specific GE dishwasher model. Replacing the pump is a common DIY repair. It takes some time but saves on labor costs. Sometimes, a faulty drain pump can even cause leaks. This is related to issues like [why your GE dishwasher might be leaking from the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ge-dishwasher-leaking-from-the-bottom).

### Reassembling Your GE Dishwasher

After testing or replacing the drain pump, you need to reassemble your GE dishwasher. This is a critical step to ensure everything works correctly and safely. First, reconnect the electrical wires to the drain pump terminals. Make sure they are secure. If you took a picture earlier, use it as a reference. Next, reattach the drain hose to the pump. Secure it with the hose clamp. Double-check all connections. Loose connections can lead to leaks or electrical problems.

Carefully slide the dishwasher back into its cabinet opening. Be gentle to avoid kinking any hoses or wires. Reinstall the mounting screws that secure the dishwasher to the countertop or cabinet sides. Reattach the kickplate at the bottom front. Once everything is back in place, restore power to the dishwasher. Flip the circuit breaker back to "on." Run a short test cycle. Listen for the pump. Watch for water drainage. Check for any leaks around the pump connections. If the water drains properly, you have successfully tested and possibly fixed your GE dishwasher drain pump.
