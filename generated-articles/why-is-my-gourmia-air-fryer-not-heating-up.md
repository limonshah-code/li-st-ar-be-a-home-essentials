**Why is my Gourmia air fryer not heating up?** Your Gourmia air fryer may not heat up due to power supply issues, a tripped safety mechanism, a dirty heating element, or a malfunctioning internal component like the thermostat or heating element itself. Simple checks often resolve these problems.

### Understanding Your Gourmia Air Fryer's Heating Mechanism

Your Gourmia air fryer works by circulating hot air. A heating element, much like a tiny oven coil, gets hot. A powerful fan then blows this hot air around the food inside the basket. This cooking method creates crispy results using less oil.

This system relies on several parts working together. The heating element must reach the right temperature. The fan needs to move air effectively. A thermostat measures the internal temperature. Safety sensors prevent overheating. If any of these parts fail, your Gourmia air fryer will not heat up correctly. Understanding this helps you pinpoint the problem when your unit acts up.

#### The Role of the Heating Element

The heating element is the core of your air fryer's heat production. It is usually a coil located at the top of the cooking chamber. Electricity flows through this coil, causing it to heat up rapidly. If this coil is damaged or dirty, it cannot generate enough heat.

A faulty heating element might show physical signs of damage, such as corrosion or breakage. Sometimes, it might not show any visible damage but still fail to function. Without a working heating element, your Gourmia air fryer simply becomes a fan.

#### How the Thermostat Controls Temperature

The thermostat is your air fryer's temperature brain. It constantly monitors the internal temperature. When you set a temperature, the thermostat ensures the heating element turns on and off to maintain that heat level. This precise control cooks food evenly.

If the thermostat malfunctions, it might incorrectly read the temperature. It could think the air fryer is hot when it is not. This causes the heating element to stay off, or turn on too late. A faulty thermostat is a common reason for inconsistent heating or no heat at all.

### Initial Checks: Power Supply and Connections

Before assuming a major breakdown, always start with the basics. Many issues with a Gourmia air fryer not heating up come from simple power problems. These checks are quick and easy to do. You might save yourself time and worry just by looking at the plug.

Make sure your air fryer has a stable power source. Appliances can be sensitive to power fluctuations. A loose connection stops power from reaching the internal components. This prevents any heating from starting.

#### Verify the Power Outlet

First, check the wall outlet. Is the air fryer plugged in firmly? Sometimes, a plug can work its way loose. Try plugging another small appliance, like a phone charger or lamp, into the same outlet. If that other appliance does not work, the outlet itself might be the problem.

Test a different outlet if the first one seems dead. This helps rule out a faulty outlet or a tripped circuit breaker. If your Gourmia air fryer turns on in a different outlet, the issue is with your wall power, not the air fryer.

#### Check the Power Cord and Plug

Inspect the power cord for any visible damage. Look for cuts, frayed wires, or melted spots. A damaged cord is a serious safety hazard. It can prevent proper power flow. Never use an appliance with a damaged cord.

Also, examine the prongs on the plug. Are they bent or broken? A damaged plug cannot make a good connection with the outlet. If you find damage, the cord or plug needs replacement by a qualified technician. Do not try to repair it yourself.

#### Resetting the Circuit Breaker

Sometimes, an appliance can trip a circuit breaker. This happens to prevent electrical overloads. Go to your home's electrical panel. Find the tripped breaker, which will be in the "off" or middle position. Flip it completely off, then firmly flip it back to the "on" position.

If the breaker trips again immediately after you plug in the Gourmia air fryer, there might be a short circuit within the appliance. In this case, unplug the air fryer and seek professional help. You can also review general troubleshooting for power issues, such as those found in articles like [Why Does My Gourmia Air Fryer Keep Turning Off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-gourmia-air-fryer-keep-turning-off), as power interruption can mimic heating problems.

### Overheat Protection and Safety Features

Air fryers have important safety features built in. These features protect the appliance and you. One common feature is overheat protection. If the air fryer gets too hot, it will shut down. This prevents damage to components and reduces fire risk.

Other safety features involve proper assembly. For the air fryer to work, its parts must be correctly in place. If the basket is not fully pushed in, the unit will not start or heat. Always check these safety measures first.

#### Understanding Overheat Protection

Overheat protection is a vital safety mechanism. It monitors the internal temperature. If the air fryer exceeds a safe operating temperature, it automatically turns off. This can happen if the air vents are blocked or if the unit is used continuously for too long.

After it cools down, the air fryer should reset itself. Unplug the unit for about 30 minutes. Let it cool completely. Then, plug it back in and try again. This often resolves heating issues caused by the overheat protection.

#### Basket and Drawer Not Fully Inserted

Most Gourmia air fryers have a safety switch. This switch requires the cooking basket or drawer to be fully inserted. If the basket is even slightly out of place, the air fryer will not power on or heat up. This prevents the heating element from exposing you to danger.

Always push the basket firmly until it clicks into place. Sometimes, crumbs or food debris can prevent the basket from seating correctly. Clean around the basket area to ensure nothing blocks its full insertion. This small check can often fix a non-heating Gourmia air fryer immediately. Always ensure the basket is fully secured before attempting to preheat or cook. Knowing [how long a Gourmia air fryer takes to preheat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-does-gourmia-air-fryer-take-to-preheat) is useful once you confirm it's heating correctly.

### Heating Element and Thermostat Malfunctions

If the power supply is fine and safety features are not tripped, the issue might be internal. The heating element and thermostat are crucial for generating and regulating heat. Problems with these parts directly affect the air fryer's ability to heat. These parts can wear out over time with regular use.

Diagnosing these internal component issues often requires a bit more investigation. You might need to look inside the appliance. Always unplug the air fryer before performing any internal checks. Safety is paramount when dealing with electrical components.

#### Diagnosing a Faulty Heating Element

A faulty heating element is a common cause for a Gourmia air fryer not heating up. When you turn on your air fryer, the heating element should glow red within minutes. If it does not, it may be broken. Look for visible signs of damage like breaks, cracks, or burnt spots on the coil.

Sometimes, the element looks fine but is still faulty. You can test it with a multimeter if you are comfortable with electrical testing. However, replacing a heating element is a complex task. It often requires professional help or considering a new unit.

#### Issues with the Thermostat or Temperature Sensor

The thermostat tells the heating element when to turn on and off. If the thermostat is faulty, it might not send the correct signals. This leads to the air fryer not heating at all or heating unevenly. A common sign of a faulty thermostat is the air fryer turning on but never reaching the set temperature.

Another related component is the temperature sensor. This sensor sends temperature readings to the control board. If it is dirty or damaged, it can send incorrect readings. This makes the air fryer think it is already hot, so it does not activate the heating element. Cleaning the sensor, if accessible, might help.

#### Control Board or Internal Fuse Failure

The control board is the brain of your Gourmia air fryer. It manages all functions, including heating. A faulty control board can cause various issues, including heating problems. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send power to the heating element. This is a complex repair and usually requires professional service.

Some air fryers also have an internal thermal fuse. This fuse acts as a safety device. It blows if the air fryer overheats to prevent further damage. Once a thermal fuse blows, it needs replacement. This task is for experienced technicians only.

### Dirty Heating Elements and Restricted Airflow

A common, yet often overlooked, reason for an air fryer not heating up is dirt. Food grease, crumbs, and debris can build up over time. This grime can coat the heating element or block airflow. When this happens, the air fryer struggles to reach or maintain the desired temperature. Regular cleaning is vital for maintaining your Gourmia air fryer's performance.

Restricted airflow means the hot air cannot circulate effectively. The air fryer relies on this circulation to cook food. If vents are blocked, the unit might overheat and shut down. It may also simply fail to get hot enough.

#### How Grease Buildup Affects Heating

Over time, grease and food particles can accumulate on the heating element. This creates a barrier. The element cannot transfer heat efficiently to the air. It might also cause the element to overheat locally, triggering the safety shutdown. You might notice smoke or a burning smell before it completely stops heating.

Regularly inspecting and cleaning the heating element can prevent this. Make sure the unit is unplugged and cool. Use a soft brush or cloth to gently wipe away buildup. For stubborn grease, a damp cloth with mild soap can help. After cleaning, ensure the element is completely dry before use. For more detailed instructions, you can refer to guides on [how to clean an air fryer heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-ninja-dual-air-fryer-heating-element).

#### Blocked Air Vents and Circulation

Air fryers have vents for intake and exhaust. These vents allow proper airflow through the cooking chamber. If these vents are blocked, hot air cannot circulate freely. This leads to uneven heating or the air fryer not heating up at all. Blockages can come from food debris, dust, or even placing the air fryer too close to a wall.

Ensure there is sufficient space around your Gourmia air fryer when it operates. Leave at least 5-6 inches of clearance on all sides. Regularly check the vents for any blockages. Use a soft brush or vacuum cleaner to remove dust and crumbs from these areas. A clean air fryer works more efficiently. Keeping your air fryer clean is crucial for its function; learn more about comprehensive cleaning in articles like [how to clean your air fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-fryer).

### Basket and Drawer Issues: Proper Placement is Key

It sounds simple, but a common reason for a Gourmia air fryer not heating up relates to the basket. Air fryers have safety switches. These switches detect if the basket or drawer is fully and correctly inserted. If the basket is not in its proper place, the air fryer will not start heating. This is a safety feature to prevent operation with an open heating element.

Always check that the basket slides in smoothly and locks firmly. Sometimes, a slight misalignment is enough to prevent the unit from functioning. A quick check of the basket can save you a lot of troubleshooting time.

#### Ensuring the Basket is Fully Inserted

When you push the basket into your Gourmia air fryer, it should slide in completely. You might hear a click, indicating it's locked. If the basket is loose or not fully pushed in, the safety switch will remain disengaged. This stops power from reaching the heating element.

Always give the basket a firm push. Wiggle it slightly to ensure it seats properly. Check for any food debris or crumbs that might be blocking the basket's path. Clean the tracks and the area where the basket connects to the main unit. This simple step often resolves the "no heat" issue.

#### Damage to the Basket or Drawer

Over time, the air fryer basket can become bent or warped. This can happen from accidental drops or harsh cleaning. If the basket's shape changes, it may no longer fit snugly into the air fryer. A basket that does not fit correctly will not trigger the safety switch.

Inspect your basket for any deformities. If it looks bent or damaged, it might be the reason for the heating issue. In such cases, you might need to replace the basket. Using a non-damaged basket ensures proper contact with the safety mechanism. Remember, the crisper tray inside the basket is also important. Some units might not operate optimally if it's missing, though many Gourmia models can function even [without the crisper tray](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-the-gourmia-air-fryer-without-the-crisper-tray).
