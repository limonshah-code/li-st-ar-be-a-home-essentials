Move any furniture or obstacles out of the way. This allows installers to move freely. It also helps them maneuver the new stove.

Next, make sure your existing gas line and electrical outlet are accessible. The installers need easy access to these connections. If your current stove uses a gas line, confirm it is shut off. You might need a plumber to cap the line if it is not in use. Ensure the area is clean and free of debris. This includes clearing out any items from the old stove's location.

Professional installers have specific training and certifications. They know how to connect gas lines correctly. They use proper tools and techniques. This expertise minimizes the risk of gas leaks or other hazards.

A professional installation guarantees adherence to local codes. Building codes exist to ensure safety in homes. Installers are aware of these regulations.

However, the potential costs of repairs, safety issues, or even health hazards are much higher.

Consider your skills and comfort level. Do you have experience working with gas lines? Do you understand local building codes for gas appliances? For most homeowners, the answer is no.
