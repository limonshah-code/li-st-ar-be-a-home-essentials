## How To Clean Fur Shoes: A Comprehensive Guide

Fur shoes offer unique style and warmth, but they can quickly lose their charm when dirty. Dust, mud, and everyday grime cling to fur fibers, making your beloved footwear look dull and matted. Keeping your fur shoes clean is simple if you know the correct approach for different fur types. I know the frustration of seeing a beautiful pair of fur-lined boots lose their softness.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about [how to clean fur shoes](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-fur-shoes) properly. We will cover identifying your fur, gathering the right tools, and applying specific cleaning techniques for real fur, faux fur, and sheepskin. You will also learn about stain removal, odor control, and important drying and maintenance tips to keep your fur footwear looking new for years.

### Takeaway:

*   Identify your fur type (real, faux, sheepskin) before cleaning.
*   Pre-treat shoes by brushing and removing loose dirt.
*   Use gentle cleaning solutions and avoid harsh chemicals.
*   Always air dry fur shoes away from direct heat.
*   Regular maintenance prevents significant dirt buildup.

To clean fur shoes, gently brush off loose dirt, then spot clean small stains with a damp cloth and mild soap. For deeper cleaning, use a specialized fur cleaner or a diluted mixture of shampoo and water, applying carefully. Rinse lightly, blot dry, and air dry completely away from heat, then brush to restore softness.

## Understanding Your Fur Footwear

Knowing the type of fur on your shoes is the first step toward proper cleaning. Different furs require different cleaning methods to prevent damage. Misidentifying the fur can lead to irreversible problems like shrinking, matting, or shedding. Let's explore the common types you might encounter on your shoes.

### Real Fur vs. Faux Fur

Distinguishing between real and faux fur is crucial for choosing the right cleaning method. Real fur comes from animals, offering natural warmth and a unique texture. Faux fur is a synthetic material designed to mimic real fur's look and feel.

*   **Real Fur:** Real fur often feels incredibly soft and smooth. When you part the fibers, you might see a leather or suede backing. Real fur can singe when exposed to a flame, leaving an odor like burnt hair. It breathes well and tends to have varying fiber lengths and colors.
*   **Faux Fur:** Faux fur usually has a more uniform appearance and feels slightly coarser or "plastic-like" to the touch. The backing is typically fabric or knitted material. When burned, faux fur melts, leaving a hard bead, and smells like burning plastic. It is less breathable than real fur.

Understanding these differences helps you avoid damaging your shoes. Real fur needs gentle, moisture-controlled cleaning, while faux fur can often withstand more traditional cleaning agents.

### Common Fur Types in Shoes

Shoes can feature various types of fur, each with its own characteristics and cleaning considerations. Sheepskin is a popular choice for boots and slippers, known for its warmth and comfort. Rabbit fur often appears as soft trim or lining.

*   **Sheepskin:** This is a natural material from sheep, often used with the wool still attached. It is incredibly warm, breathable, and moisture-wicking. Sheepskin shoes, like UGGs, are popular for their cozy feel. Cleaning sheepskin requires specific products to maintain its lanolin and softness. If you own shoes made of this material, our guide on [how to clean Ugg shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-ugg-shoes) can offer more specific insights.
*   **Rabbit Fur:** Rabbit fur is very soft, light, and fine. It is often used as trim, pompoms, or as a luxurious lining in dressier shoes. It is delicate and prone to matting if not handled gently. Dry cleaning methods or very light spot cleaning are usually best for rabbit fur.
*   **Synthetic/Faux Fur:** This includes acrylic, polyester, and modacrylic fibers. It is durable and less sensitive to water than real fur. Faux fur is versatile and can be cleaned with milder detergents. You can be a bit more liberal with cleaning solutions on faux fur compared to real fur.

Identify the material before proceeding. This step ensures you use the most effective and safest cleaning strategy for your fur footwear. My own experience taught me that a little research upfront saves a lot of trouble later.

## Essential Tools and Solutions for Fur Shoe Cleaning

Having the right tools and cleaning solutions makes the fur shoe cleaning process much easier and more effective. Using household items you likely already own can save you a trip to the store. Gathering everything before you start also ensures a smooth workflow.

### Basic Cleaning Tools

These are the everyday items you will need for general fur shoe cleaning. Each tool serves a specific purpose in preparing and cleaning your fur.

*   **Soft-bristled brush:** A soft brush helps remove loose dirt and debris without damaging the fur fibers. You can use a shoe brush, a pet brush designed for fine fur, or even a soft toothbrush for small areas. I find a simple baby brush works wonders for delicate fur.
*   **Clean cloths or sponges:** You will need several clean, lint-free cloths for applying cleaners, wiping away dirt, and blotting excess moisture. Microfiber cloths are excellent for this purpose as they are highly absorbent and gentle.
*   **Vacuum cleaner with hose attachment:** For deeper dirt, a vacuum with a low-suction hose attachment can effectively pull out dust and small particles trapped deep within the fur. This is especially useful for dense fur.
*   **Plastic bags/old newspapers:** These are useful for stuffing inside the shoes to maintain their shape during drying. They also absorb moisture from the inside out, speeding up the drying process.

### Gentle Cleaning Solutions

Harsh chemicals can damage fur, especially real fur, by stripping its natural oils or causing the fibers to stiffen. Stick to gentle, mild solutions.

*   **Mild liquid detergent/shampoo:** A small amount of mild dish soap, baby shampoo, or a gentle wool detergent works well for both real and faux fur. Mix a tiny drop with water to create a sudsy solution. This is often enough to tackle common dirt.
*   **Specialized fur cleaner:** For real fur or delicate sheepskin, a cleaner specifically formulated for these materials is the safest bet. These products are designed to clean without damaging natural fibers or drying out the leather backing. Many brands offer sheepskin cleaning kits.
*   **White vinegar:** Diluted white vinegar is excellent for deodorizing and breaking down minor stains without leaving residues. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water for a gentle cleaning and deodorizing spray. It is also good for general shoe care, such as when you need to [clean the inside of shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes) to combat odors.
*   **Cornstarch or baking soda:** These powders are natural absorbents. They can absorb oils and odors from fur without the need for liquid. They are perfect for dry cleaning minor greasy spots or refreshing stale-smelling fur.
*   **Rubbing alcohol (for specific stains):** For ink or tougher, localized stains on faux fur, a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab can be effective. Always test in an inconspicuous area first, as it can be strong.

Having these items ready ensures you are prepared for various cleaning scenarios. My personal approach is to always start with the mildest solution first and only move to stronger options if necessary.

## Pre-Cleaning Steps and Preparation

Before you apply any cleaning solution to your fur shoes, proper preparation is essential. These initial steps help remove loose dirt and prevent stains from setting deeper. Skipping this phase can make the overall cleaning process less effective and potentially damage the fur.

### Dry Cleaning and Debris Removal

The first step is always to remove as much dry dirt and debris as possible. This prevents it from turning into mud when wet, which would make the cleaning job harder. This is similar to preparing any shoe, whether it's [cleaning muddy shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-muddy-shoes) or just dusty ones.

1.  **Shake out loose debris:** Hold your shoes upside down and gently shake them. This helps dislodge any pebbles, sand, or loose dirt trapped within the fur or sole. Do this outdoors if possible.
2.  **Brush the fur:** Use a soft-bristled brush to gently brush the fur in the direction of the nap. This helps lift out embedded dirt, dust, and tangled fibers. For faux fur, you can brush a bit more vigorously. For real fur, be very gentle to avoid pulling out hairs.
3.  **Vacuum the fur (optional but recommended):** If your shoes have dense fur, a vacuum cleaner with a brush or upholstery attachment can effectively remove deeply embedded dirt. Set the vacuum to a low suction level and gently pass the nozzle over the fur, moving in the direction of the fur's lay.
4.  **Inspect for specific stains:** Once the loose dirt is gone, carefully examine the fur for any specific stains like mud, grease, or food spills. Identifying these now helps you choose the right spot-cleaning method later. For broader guidance on stains, our article on [how to clean stained shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes) offers valuable tips.

### Protecting Non-Fur Parts

Many fur shoes have other materials like leather, suede, or rubber soles. Protecting these parts from water or cleaning solutions meant for fur is important. Water can sometimes leave marks on leather or suede.

1.  **Tape off vulnerable areas:** Use painter's tape or masking tape to cover any leather, suede, or decorative elements that you do not want to get wet or come into contact with cleaning solutions. Ensure the tape adheres well but is easy to remove without residue.
2.  **Stuff the shoes:** Crumple up old newspapers or use shoe trees and stuff them firmly inside the shoes. This helps maintain the shoe's shape during the cleaning and drying process. It also absorbs moisture from the inside if the shoe gets damp, preventing shrinkage or warping. I always make sure the shoes are fully stuffed but not stretched.
3.  **Test cleaning solutions:** Before applying any cleaner to the entire fur area, always perform a patch test. Choose an inconspicuous spot, like an inner seam or a small area underneath the tongue. Apply a tiny amount of your chosen cleaning solution, let it sit for a few minutes, then blot it dry. Check for any discoloration, shrinking, or damage to the fur. If no adverse reaction occurs, it is safe to proceed.

Taking these preparatory steps ensures that your cleaning efforts are effective and do not cause unintended harm to your cherished fur shoes. It sets the stage for a successful and safe cleaning process.

## Spot Cleaning Techniques for Minor Stains

Spot cleaning is your best friend for small spills or isolated dirt marks on your fur shoes. This method targets specific areas without soaking the entire shoe, which is ideal for delicate furs. Acting quickly on a fresh stain can often prevent it from becoming a permanent problem.

### Addressing Fresh Stains Immediately

Timely action significantly increases your chances of successful stain removal. Different types of fresh stains require specific approaches.

1.  **Liquid spills (e.g., coffee, juice):**
    *   **Blot, do not rub:** Immediately blot the spill with a clean, dry cloth or paper towel. Apply gentle pressure to absorb as much liquid as possible. Rubbing will spread the stain and push it deeper into the fur fibers.
    *   **Damp cloth wipe:** Dip a clean cloth in plain cold water, wring it out thoroughly until it is just damp, and gently blot the stained area. Continue blotting with a clean section of the cloth until the stain is lifted.
    *   **Air dry:** Allow the area to air dry completely. Avoid using heat.
2.  **Mud or dirt:**
    *   **Let it dry:** Never try to clean wet mud. Allow the mud to dry completely and harden. This is a crucial step I learned from handling many muddy shoes.
    *   **Brush off:** Once dry, gently brush off the dried mud using a soft-bristled brush. Most of the mud should flake away. You can also carefully use the edge of a spoon to scrape off thicker clumps.
    *   **Vacuum:** Use a low-suction vacuum attachment to pick up any remaining dirt particles.
    *   **Damp cloth (if needed):** If a faint mark remains, lightly dab the area with a cloth dampened with a mild soap solution (one drop of mild soap in a cup of water). Blot dry immediately.

### Dealing with Stubborn Spots

Some stains, like grease or ink, require a bit more targeted treatment. Always remember to test any solution on an inconspicuous area first.

1.  **Grease or oil stains:**
    *   **Absorbent powder:** Sprinkle a generous amount of cornstarch, baking soda, or talcum powder directly onto the greasy stain. These powders will absorb the oil.
    *   **Let it sit:** Allow the powder to sit for several hours, or even overnight, to fully absorb the grease.
    *   **Brush and vacuum:** Gently brush off the powder, then vacuum any residue. Repeat if necessary until the stain is gone. This dry method is safe for all fur types.
2.  **Ink or dye stains (faux fur only):**
    *   **Rubbing alcohol:** Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol.
    *   **Dab the stain:** Gently dab the ink stain with the alcohol-soaked swab, working from the outside of the stain inwards. Do not rub, as this can spread the ink.
    *   **Blot with clean cloth:** Immediately blot the area with a clean, damp cloth to remove the alcohol and lifted ink. Repeat until the stain fades.
    *   **Caution:** Rubbing alcohol is generally not recommended for real fur or leather as it can dry out and damage natural fibers.
3.  **Food stains (non-greasy):**
    *   **Scrape off solids:** Carefully scrape off any solid food particles with a dull knife or spoon.
    *   **Mild soap solution:** Mix a tiny amount of mild liquid detergent with cool water.
    *   **Dab and blot:** Dampen a clean cloth with the solution, wring it out well, and gently dab the stain. Immediately follow with a cloth dampened with plain water to rinse, then blot dry with a clean, dry cloth.

Remember, patience and gentle movements are key when spot cleaning fur. Aggressive rubbing can damage the fur fibers and spread the stain. I always proceed slowly, checking my progress after each step.

## Deep Cleaning Methods for Different Fur Types

When spot cleaning is not enough, or your fur shoes need a more thorough refresh, deep cleaning becomes necessary. The approach varies significantly depending on whether your shoes feature real fur, faux fur, or sheepskin. Always prioritize gentleness to maintain the fur's texture and integrity.

### Cleaning Real Fur Shoes

Real fur, such as rabbit or coyote fur trim, is delicate. It is prone to shrinking or stiffening if exposed to too much moisture or harsh chemicals. Dry cleaning or very minimal wet cleaning is the preferred method.

1.  **Professional cleaning recommended:** For valuable or heavily soiled real fur, professional fur cleaning is always the safest option. They have specialized equipment and knowledge to clean and condition fur properly.
2.  **Home dry cleaning (for light soil):**
    *   **Powder application:** Sprinkle a generous amount of absorbent powder like cornstarch or baking soda over the fur. Make sure the powder reaches the base of the fur fibers.
    *   **Gently work in:** Use your fingers or a soft brush to gently work the powder into the fur.
    *   **Let it sit:** Allow the powder to sit for several hours, ideally overnight. It will absorb dirt, oils, and odors.
    *   **Brush out and vacuum:** Outdoors, gently shake the shoes to remove most of the powder. Then, use a soft-bristled brush to thoroughly brush out all remaining powder. Follow up with a low-suction vacuum cleaner attachment to remove any lingering residue. This method effectively refreshes the fur without moisture.
3.  **Very light damp cleaning (for surface dirt):**
    *   **Mild solution:** Mix a tiny drop of very mild shampoo (like baby shampoo) with cool water. The solution should barely lather.
    *   **Damp cloth:** Dip a clean cloth into the solution and wring it out almost completely. The cloth should be barely damp, not wet.
    *   **Gentle wipe:** Gently wipe the surface of the fur in the direction of the nap. Avoid soaking the fur or the leather backing.
    *   **Rinse cloth and wipe:** Dampen another clean cloth with plain water, wring it out, and gently wipe the fur again to remove any soap residue.
    *   **Blot dry immediately:** Use a clean, dry towel to blot the fur.
    *   **Air dry:** Allow to air dry completely away from direct heat. Brush when dry to restore fluffiness.

### Cleaning Faux Fur Shoes

Faux fur is more resilient than real fur and can withstand a bit more moisture. However, avoid machine washing unless the shoe explicitly states it is safe. Our article on [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer) might offer relevant warnings about delicate materials.

1.  **Hand washing method:**
    *   **Prepare solution:** Mix a small amount of mild liquid detergent or baby shampoo with cool water in a basin.
    *   **Dampen fur:** Dip a clean sponge or soft cloth into the soapy water, wring it out well. It should be damp, not dripping.
    *   **Wipe down fur:** Gently wipe down the faux fur sections of your shoes, working in small sections. Pay attention to dirty areas. Avoid soaking the shoe completely, especially the sole or non-fur parts.
    *   **Rinse:** Dip a separate clean cloth into plain cool water, wring it out well, and wipe the fur again to remove soap residue. Repeat this rinsing step until all soap is gone.
    *   **Blot dry:** Use a clean, dry towel to blot the fur aggressively, pressing out as much water as possible.
2.  **Foaming cleaner method:**
    *   **Apply foam:** Some mild upholstery or carpet cleaners come in foam form. Apply a small amount directly to a clean cloth.
    *   **Work into fur:** Gently work the foam into the faux fur with the cloth.
    *   **Wipe clean:** Use a fresh, damp cloth to wipe away the foam and dirt.
    *   **Air dry:** Allow to air dry, then fluff with a brush.

### Cleaning Sheepskin Shoes (e.g., UGGs)

Sheepskin is a unique material that combines leather with wool. It requires specific care to prevent the leather from drying out and the wool from matting. Many brands, like UGG, offer their own cleaning kits.

1.  **Specialized sheepskin cleaner:** This is the most recommended method.
    *   **Lightly dampen surface:** Lightly dampen the entire sheepskin surface of the shoe with cool, clean water. Do not saturate.
    *   **Apply cleaner:** Apply a small amount of the sheepskin cleaner to a clean, damp sponge or soft brush.
    *   **Gentle scrub:** Gently scrub the sheepskin surface evenly. Avoid excessive scrubbing in one spot.
    *   **Rinse carefully:** Use a clean, damp sponge or cloth (rinsed frequently) to gently wipe away the cleaner and dirt. Do not rinse under running water, as this can over-saturate the material.
    *   **Stuff and dry:** Stuff the shoes with paper towels or newspaper to maintain shape. Allow to air dry completely in a cool, well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight or heat. This drying step can take 24-48 hours.
2.  **DIY alternative (use with caution):**
    *   **Diluted baby shampoo:** Mix a small amount (about 1 teaspoon) of baby shampoo with 1 cup of cool water.
    *   **Apply with sponge:** Dampen a sponge with the solution and gently wipe the sheepskin surface.
    *   **Rinse and dry:** Follow the same rinsing and drying instructions as for specialized cleaners.
    *   **Condition (important):** After drying, sheepskin leather can feel stiff. Apply a sheepskin conditioner specifically designed to rehydrate the leather. This step is crucial for maintaining softness and flexibility.

Regardless of the fur type, always ensure thorough drying to prevent mold or odors. My own experience tells me that patience during the drying phase is just as important as the cleaning itself.

## Drying and Restoring Fur's Luster

Proper drying is critical after cleaning your fur shoes. Incorrect drying can lead to matting, stiffness, shrinking, or even mildew growth. Once dry, restoring the fur's natural fluffiness and luster completes the cleaning process.

### Essential Drying Techniques

Never rush the drying process for fur shoes. Air drying is always the safest and most recommended method. Avoid any direct heat sources.

1.  **Blot excess water:** Immediately after cleaning, use clean, dry towels to gently blot and press out as much excess water as possible from the fur. This reduces drying time significantly. For sheepskin, you can gently squeeze larger sections between towels.
2.  **Stuff the shoes:** Fill the inside of the shoes with clean, crumpled paper towels or old newspapers. This helps absorb internal moisture and maintains the shoe's original shape as it dries. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp.
3.  **Air dry in a cool, well-ventilated area:** Place the shoes in a spot with good air circulation, away from direct sunlight, radiators, or heaters. Heat can cause the fur to become brittle, shrink the leather backing (for real fur/sheepskin), or melt faux fur fibers. A fan can help circulate air and speed up drying without adding heat.
4.  **Dry horizontally or slightly elevated:** Lay the shoes on their side or on a drying rack to allow air to circulate around all surfaces.
5.  **Patience is key:** Drying can take anywhere from 24 hours to several days, depending on the fur type, shoe thickness, and humidity levels. Do not wear the shoes until they are completely dry, inside and out. I check them by feeling both the fur and the inner lining.

### Restoring Fur's Softness and Appearance

Once the fur is thoroughly dry, it might look a little flattened or matted. These steps will bring back its natural fluffiness and shine.

1.  **Gentle brushing:** Use a soft-bristled brush (a pet brush or a wide-toothed comb works well for faux fur) to gently brush the fur.
    *   **For real fur:** Brush carefully in the direction of the fur's nap. This separates the fibers and restores their natural lay.
    *   **For faux fur:** You can brush more vigorously, against the nap first to fluff it up, then in the direction of the nap to smooth it out. This helps untangle any matted areas.
    *   **For sheepskin:** Use a wire brush (like a suede brush or specialized sheepskin brush) on the wool side to fluff the fibers once dry. This is especially important for UGG-style boots.
2.  **Light shaking:** After brushing, give the shoes a gentle shake to further fluff the fur and help it settle naturally.
3.  **Conditioning (for real fur/sheepskin):** For real fur and sheepskin, a specialized fur or sheepskin conditioner can rehydrate the leather backing and maintain the softness of the fibers. Spray or apply sparingly according to product instructions, then gently brush through. This prevents stiffness and cracking.
4.  **Protectant spray (optional):** Once completely clean and dry, consider applying a water and stain repellent spray specifically designed for shoes or fur. This creates a protective barrier that helps repel future dirt and moisture, making subsequent cleaning easier. Always choose a product safe for your specific fur type.

Following these drying and restoration steps ensures that your fur shoes not only become clean but also regain their luxurious appearance and feel. This completes the transformation of your shoes from drab to fab.

## Preventative Care and Long-Term Maintenance

Cleaning your fur shoes only when they are visibly dirty is a reactive approach. Implementing regular preventative care and maintenance habits will significantly extend their lifespan and keep them looking their best. A little effort often saves a lot of cleaning hassle down the line.

### Regular Brushing and Shaking

Simple, frequent actions can prevent dirt from embedding deeply and fur from matting.

1.  **Daily shake-out:** After each wear, give your fur shoes a quick shake outdoors. This dislodges loose dirt, dust, and debris before it has a chance to settle into the fur fibers. It is a quick habit that makes a big difference.
2.  **Weekly brushing:** Use a soft-bristled brush to gently brush the fur once a week, or more often if worn frequently. This removes surface dust, prevents tangles, and helps the fur maintain its natural fluffiness. For faux fur, brushing against the nap and then with it can help maintain volume. For real fur, always brush gently with the nap.
3.  **Inspect for minor issues:** While brushing, take a moment to inspect for any small stains or signs of wear. Catching minor issues early makes them easier to address.

### Protection from Elements and Storage

Environmental factors can greatly impact the condition of your fur shoes. Protecting them from moisture, heat, and proper storage are vital.

1.  **Water and stain repellent spray:** Before the first wear, and periodically after cleaning, apply a quality water and stain repellent spray suitable for your fur type. This creates an invisible barrier that repels liquids and makes it harder for stains to penetrate. Always test on an inconspicuous area first. This is similar to protecting other delicate footwear like leather shoes; learn more about caring for those here: [how to clean leather shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leather-shoes).
2.  **Avoid extreme conditions:**
    *   **Moisture:** Try to avoid wearing fur shoes in heavy rain, snow, or slush. If they do get wet, follow the immediate drying steps outlined in the previous section. Dampness can lead to mold, matting, or damage to the leather backing.
    *   **Heat:** Store and dry fur shoes away from direct sunlight, radiators, or heating vents. Excessive heat can dry out real fur, making it brittle, or melt synthetic fibers in faux fur.
3.  **Proper storage:**
    *   **Breathable storage:** Store fur shoes in a breathable shoe bag or box to protect them from dust and dirt. Avoid plastic bags, which can trap moisture and cause mold or mildew.
    *   **Maintain shape:** Use shoe trees or stuff the shoes with acid-free tissue paper or crumpled newspaper to help them retain their shape while stored. This prevents creases and maintains the shoe's structure.
    *   **Cool, dry place:** Store your fur shoes in a cool, dry, dark place. This protects the fur from fading and preserves its texture.

By incorporating these preventative measures into your routine, you will find that your fur shoes require deep cleaning much less often. This approach saves time and effort while keeping your investment looking fantastic for seasons to come. I always apply a protectant spray to my new fur boots as soon as I get them home.

## Dealing with Specific Issues: Odors, Matting, and Water Damage

Sometimes, cleaning fur shoes involves more than just removing dirt. Odors can build up, fur can become matted from wear, and unexpected water exposure can cause problems. Addressing these specific issues requires targeted solutions.

### Eliminating Unpleasant Odors

Fur can absorb odors from sweat, feet, and the environment. Getting rid of these smells is important for fresh-smelling footwear. Our guide on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes) offers broader insights into odor removal, many of which apply here.

1.  **Baking soda absorption:**
    *   **Sprinkle inside:** Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside the fur-lined shoes, especially focusing on the footbed.
    *   **Leave overnight:** Let the baking soda sit for at least 8-12 hours, or even up to 24 hours. It effectively absorbs odors.
    *   **Vacuum out:** Use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to thoroughly vacuum out all the baking soda.
2.  **White vinegar spray (for external fur):**
    *   **Dilute:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle.
    *   **Light mist:** Lightly mist the fur (test on an inconspicuous area first, especially for real fur). Do not saturate.
    *   **Air dry:** Allow the shoes to air dry completely in a
