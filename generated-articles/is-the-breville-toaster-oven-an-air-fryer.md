## Is The Breville Toaster Oven An Air Fryer? Unpacking Its Multifunctionality

Kitchen appliances evolve rapidly. Many people look for tools that do more than one job. This saves space and makes cooking easier. The Breville toaster oven range often comes up in these conversations. It is a popular brand known for smart designs. People often wonder about its air frying capabilities.

I have found Breville models are very versatile. They offer many cooking functions. This includes options beyond just toasting. This article explores if the Breville toaster oven works as an air fryer. We will look at its technology and features. We will also discuss the benefits it offers for your kitchen.

### Takeaway

*   Many Breville Smart Ovens include an "Air Fry" function.
*   They use strong convection to mimic air frying results.
*   These appliances combine multiple cooking modes in one unit.
*   Breville air fryer toaster ovens save counter space.
*   They offer versatility for various cooking tasks.

### Is the Breville toaster oven an air fryer?

Yes, many modern Breville toaster ovens, especially models like the Smart Oven Air Fryer and Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro, include a dedicated air frying function. These appliances combine the capabilities of a traditional toaster oven with the rapid convection technology of an air fryer, offering versatile cooking options in one countertop unit.

### Understanding Breville's Convection Technology

Breville is a brand known for smart kitchen solutions. Their toaster ovens are no exception. These ovens use advanced convection technology. This technology is key to how they perform. It differs from traditional heating methods.

Convection involves circulating hot air. A fan inside the oven moves heated air around the food. This creates an even temperature throughout the cooking chamber. Standard ovens heat food from static elements. This can lead to uneven cooking. Convection speeds up cooking times. It also helps achieve a crispy texture on food surfaces.

Brevilleâ€™s Smart Ovens often feature multiple fan speeds. Some models, like the Smart Oven Air Fryer, have a super convection setting. This high-speed air circulation is what truly mimics an air fryer. It blasts hot air around the food. This process quickly cooks and crisps items. The fan ensures heat reaches all sides of the food. This eliminates the need for flipping in many cases.

The intense air circulation in Breville convection ovens is powerful. It strips moisture from the food's surface. This creates a crunchy exterior. This is the desired outcome for air fried foods. It works well for fries, chicken wings, and vegetables. My experience shows that this technology really makes a difference. It helps food cook faster and get crispier. This makes Breville ovens more than just basic toasters.

### The "Air Fry" Function in Breville Smart Ovens

Many Breville Smart Ovens now come with a specific "Air Fry" setting. This function is not just a marketing term. It signifies a specialized cooking mode. When you select "Air Fry," the oven activates its strongest convection. It uses a higher fan speed and precise heating. This combination creates the ideal environment for air frying.

The oven's internal fan operates at its maximum speed. This circulates very hot air quickly around your food. The high airflow helps to cook food fast. It also ensures that food develops a crispy, golden-brown crust. This is without needing large amounts of oil. This process is very similar to how a dedicated air fryer works. It gives you the fried texture you want.

Using the air fry function in a Breville oven is simple. You place your food in the air fry basket. This basket allows air to circulate fully around the food. Then, you select the "Air Fry" setting on the control panel. The oven automatically adjusts temperature and fan speed. It optimizes for crispy results. This means you get healthier versions of your favorite fried foods.

For instance, I can make perfectly crispy chicken nuggets. Frozen french fries turn out golden and crunchy. The air fry function also works well for roasting vegetables. It gives them a lovely char. Many users appreciate this dedicated setting. It takes the guesswork out of air frying. It ensures consistent, excellent results every time. Learning [how to use your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer-pro) can unlock its full potential.

### Beyond Air Frying: Multifunctionality of Breville Toaster Ovens

Breville toaster ovens offer more than just air frying. They are true multi-functional appliances. This makes them valuable additions to any kitchen. These ovens typically include a range of pre-set cooking functions. You can toast, bake, roast, broil, and warm food. Some advanced models even feature dehydrate and slow cook settings.

The ability to perform multiple tasks is a huge benefit. You can toast bread for breakfast. Later, you can bake cookies or roast a chicken. The next day, you might use it to air fry vegetables. This versatility means you need fewer single-purpose appliances. It frees up valuable counter space. This is especially helpful in smaller kitchens. I find this aspect incredibly useful. I do not need a separate toaster, oven, and air fryer.

Consider the various modes:
*   **Toast:** Perfect for bread, bagels, and frozen waffles.
*   **Bake:** Ideal for cakes, casseroles, and oven-baked meals.
*   **Roast:** Great for meats, vegetables, and potatoes.
*   **Broil:** Excellent for melting cheese or browning dishes.
*   **Warm:** Keeps food at serving temperature without overcooking.
*   **Dehydrate:** Removes moisture from fruits, vegetables, and jerky. You can learn if [you can dehydrate in the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-dehydrate-in-the-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer).
*   **Proof:** Provides a warm environment for dough to rise.
*   **Slow Cook:** Cooks food slowly at a low temperature, similar to a slow cooker.

Each function is optimized for its specific task. The oven uses smart algorithms. It adjusts temperature and fan speed. This ensures the best cooking results for each mode. This level of control makes cooking easier. It also leads to more consistent and delicious outcomes. My Breville oven has become my go-to appliance for almost everything.

### Advantages of a Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven Combo

Choosing a Breville air fryer toaster oven combo offers many benefits. These appliances are more than just a convenience. They enhance your cooking experience significantly. I have found several key advantages that stand out.

First, **space efficiency** is a major plus. Counter space is precious in any kitchen. A multi-functional appliance reduces clutter. Instead of having a separate toaster, a standalone air fryer, and a small oven, you get one unit. This single footprint handles many tasks. It makes your kitchen feel more organized.

Second, **versatility** is unmatched. As discussed, these ovens do much more than just air fry. You can bake a cake, roast a chicken, toast your bread, and dehydrate fruit. This wide range of functions means you can prepare almost any meal. It allows for more creativity in the kitchen. You can experiment with different cooking methods easily.

Third, these ovens provide **healthier cooking options**. Air frying uses hot air circulation to cook food. This requires little to no added oil. You can enjoy crispy foods like fries or chicken wings with far less fat. This is a healthier alternative to traditional deep frying. My family appreciates the taste without the guilt.

Fourth, **energy efficiency** is a hidden benefit. Breville toaster ovens are smaller than full-sized ovens. They heat up much faster. They also use less energy for smaller meals. This saves on your electricity bill over time. For daily meals or snacks, it is far more efficient than preheating a large oven.

Finally, **performance and consistency** are strong points. Breville is known for quality engineering. Their Smart Ovens often feature Element IQ technology. This directs heat to where it is needed most. This ensures precise temperature control and even cooking. My food consistently comes out perfectly cooked and crispy. The combination of features in one unit truly simplifies meal preparation.

### Distinguishing Breville Models: What to Look For

Breville offers a range of toaster ovens. Not all models include an air frying function. It is important to know what to look for when buying one. This ensures you get the features you need. I always advise checking the product specifications carefully.

The most prominent models with air frying capabilities are:
*   **Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer (BOV860):** This is often the base model for air frying. It features the "Air Fry" preset. It uses higher fan speeds for crisping.
*   **Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro (BOV900):** This is a larger, more advanced model. It offers even more functions. It has super convection technology. This provides even stronger airflow for superior air frying and dehydrating.

When looking at Breville models, check the name. If "Air Fryer" is in the product name, it will have the function. Also, look at the control panel. A dedicated "Air Fry" button or setting confirms its capability. Some older or more basic Breville toaster ovens may have convection. However, they may not have the specific "Air Fry" preset. Their convection might not be as powerful as models designed for air frying.

Consider the size you need. The "Pro" model is larger. It fits a 9x13 inch pan. This is good for bigger families or batch cooking. The standard "Air Fryer" model is more compact. It still offers excellent capacity. Think about your typical meal sizes. This will help you choose the right oven volume.

Also, examine the included accessories. Air fryer models usually come with an air fry basket. This basket is crucial for proper air circulation during air frying. Without it, you might not get the best results. Reading reviews and comparing features on Breville's official website is always a good step. This ensures you make an informed decision.

### Mastering Your Breville Air Fryer: Tips for Optimal Results

Getting the best results from your Breville air fryer toaster oven requires a few simple techniques. I have learned these tips through practice. They make a big difference in food quality.

1.  **Preheat Properly:** Just like a full-sized oven, preheating is essential. Breville ovens heat up quickly. Allow 5-10 minutes for the oven to reach the set temperature. This ensures food starts cooking immediately at the correct heat. It helps achieve that perfect crispy exterior.
2.  **Use the Air Fry Basket:** Always use the dedicated air fry basket. This basket is designed to allow maximum air circulation around food. Placing food directly on a solid tray restricts airflow. This prevents proper crisping. The basket ensures even cooking and browning.
3.  **Do Not Overcrowd:** Overcrowding the basket is a common mistake. Food needs space for hot air to circulate freely. If you pack too much food, it steams instead of fries. Cook in batches if necessary. This ensures every piece gets crispy. A single layer is usually best for optimal results.
4.  **Flip or Shake Midway:** While the powerful convection helps, flipping or shaking your food halfway through cooking is beneficial. This promotes even browning on all sides. For fries or smaller items, a quick shake of the basket works well. For larger items, a simple flip with tongs is enough.
5.  **Adjust Cooking Times:** Air frying often cooks faster than conventional baking. Start with the lower end of recommended cooking times. Check food regularly. You can always add more time if needed. Overcooked air-fried food can become dry.
6.  **Use a Little Oil (Optional):** While air frying reduces oil use, a light spray or toss with a teaspoon of oil can enhance crispiness and flavor. This is especially true for fresh vegetables or leaner meats. Avoid aerosol sprays. They can damage non-stick coatings. Use an oil mister instead.
7.  **Clean After Each Use:** Food residues can build up. This affects performance and can cause odors. Cleaning your Breville oven frequently helps maintain its efficiency. Regular cleaning also ensures a hygienic cooking environment.

Following these tips will help you unlock the full potential of your Breville air fryer toaster oven. You will consistently achieve delicious, crispy results.

### Maintenance and Cleaning for Your Breville Toaster Oven

Proper maintenance and regular cleaning are crucial. They ensure your Breville toaster oven lasts long. They also keep it performing at its best. A clean oven operates more efficiently. It prevents smoke and odors. I make cleaning a regular part of my kitchen routine.

*   **Unplug Before Cleaning:** Always unplug the oven from the power outlet. This is a crucial safety step. It prevents accidental activation during cleaning.
*   **Cool Down Completely:** Allow the oven to cool down completely. Hot surfaces can cause burns. Trying to clean a hot oven is also less effective.
*   **Wipe Down Interior Regularly:** After each use, wipe down the interior. Use a damp cloth with mild dish soap. This removes food splatters and crumbs before they harden. For stubborn grease, a baking soda paste can work wonders. Apply the paste, let it sit, then wipe clean. Knowing [how to clean the inside of your Breville air fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-inside-of-breville-air-fryer) is key to its longevity.
*   **Clean Accessories:** The air fry basket, baking pan, and crumb tray need regular cleaning. Most Breville accessories are not dishwasher safe. Hand wash them with warm, soapy water. For the air fry basket, a brush can help remove stuck-on food. Check if [you can put the Breville air fryer basket in the dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-breville-air-fryer-basket-in-dishwasher).
*   **Empty the Crumb Tray:** The crumb tray collects crumbs and small food pieces. Empty it after every few uses. This prevents burning and smoke during operation. It also reduces fire risk.
*   **Clean Exterior Surfaces:** Wipe the exterior with a soft, damp cloth. Use a non-abrasive cleaner if needed. Avoid harsh chemicals. They can damage the finish.
*   **Address Spills Immediately:** Clean up spills as soon as the oven cools. This prevents them from baking onto the surface. Baked-on spills are much harder to remove.

Regular cleaning prevents residue buildup. It also ensures efficient cooking. A well-maintained Breville oven provides consistent results. It also extends the appliance's lifespan. An easy-to-clean oven makes maintenance less of a chore. Many users find the [Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer easy to clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-the-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer-easy-to-clean). This makes regular upkeep simpler.

### FAQs About Breville Toaster Oven Air Fryers

An air fryer toaster oven offers greater versatility, combining multiple cooking functions like baking, roasting, and toasting with air frying. It saves counter space compared to having separate appliances. Standalone air fryers might heat up slightly faster and be more compact for small batches, but the combo unit offers more overall utility for diverse cooking needs.

#### How does air frying in a Breville differ from deep frying?
Air frying in a Breville oven uses rapid circulation of hot air to cook food and create a crispy texture, requiring little to no oil. Deep frying submerges food entirely in hot oil. Air frying is a much healthier method, significantly reducing fat content while still delivering a satisfyingly crunchy result.

#### What accessories come with a Breville air fryer toaster oven?
Typically, Breville air fryer toaster ovens come with a wire rack, a baking pan, and an air fry basket. The air fry basket is crucial for effective air circulation during the air frying process. Some models may also include a pizza pan or a broiling rack, depending on the specific model and its functions.

#### Can you put aluminum foil in a Breville air fryer oven?
Yes, you can generally put aluminum foil in a Breville air fryer oven. It can be used to line the drip tray for easy cleanup or to cover food to prevent over-browning. However, avoid covering the air fry basket with foil, as this obstructs airflow and defeats the purpose of air frying. Also, ensure foil does not touch heating elements.
