### Your Kenmore dishwasher's manufacturing year is usually hidden within its serial number. This unique code, often found on a sticker inside the dishwasher door, contains specific digits or letters that reveal the month and year of production. Once you find it, a quick decoding method tells you its exact age.

## Why Knowing Your Kenmore Dishwasher's Age Matters

Understanding your Kenmore dishwasher's manufacturing year offers many benefits. This knowledge helps you make informed decisions about your appliance. It goes beyond simple curiosity. The age of an appliance impacts its performance and lifespan.

Knowing the age guides your maintenance schedule. Older dishwashers might require more frequent cleaning. They may also need specific checks for common wear and tear issues. For example, knowing the age helps you anticipate when parts might fail. You can plan for repairs or replacements better. It also affects warranty claims. Most warranties cover appliances only for a few years after manufacture.

Your dishwasher's age also helps you evaluate its efficiency. Newer models often have better energy ratings. An older Kenmore dishwasher might use more water and electricity. This costs you more money over time. If your dishwasher is very old, upgrading could save you money on utility bills. It also helps you decide if a repair is worth the cost. A major repair on an old machine might be less wise than investing in a new one.

## Decoding Your Kenmore Dishwasher: Finding the Model and Serial Number

To determine your Kenmore dishwasher's age, you first need to find its model and serial numbers. These numbers are unique identifiers for your specific appliance. They are always printed on a label or data plate. This plate is usually placed in a discreet but accessible location on the dishwasher itself. Finding this sticker is the critical first step.

Most Kenmore dishwashers have this information on the inner edge of the dishwasher door. This is a common place for appliance manufacturers. Open the door fully and look around the perimeter. Sometimes, it is on the side of the door or on the frame of the dishwasher tub. It might also be on the kick plate at the very bottom, beneath the door. Take your time to inspect these areas carefully. The sticker might be small or blend in with the surrounding parts.

Once you find the sticker, you will see several pieces of information. Look for "Model No." or "M/N" followed by a series of letters and numbers. Then, find "Serial No." or "S/N" with another distinct set of characters. Sometimes, the terms "Date Code" or "Mfg. Date" might also appear directly. Write down both the model and serial numbers accurately. These details are crucial for the next steps. Sometimes, the sticker is faded. Use a flashlight if needed to read it clearly.

## The Heart of the Matter: How to Find Your Kenmore Dishwasher's Manufacturing Date Code

The manufacturing date of your Kenmore dishwasher is almost always embedded within its serial number. Kenmore itself does not make appliances. Instead, it rebrands appliances made by other major manufacturers. These include Whirlpool, GE, Electrolux (Frigidaire), and others. Each original equipment manufacturer (OEM) uses its own unique serial number format. This means the method for decoding the date varies.

The serial number typically uses specific characters to represent the year and month. For example, some manufacturers use a letter to denote the year. Others might use a pair of digits. The month is usually represented by a number (1-12) or another letter. Knowing which company made your specific Kenmore model is important. This helps you apply the correct decoding method. You can often find the OEM listed on the same data plate. Sometimes, it's inferred by the model number's first few digits.

Once you identify the OEM, you can match their serial number format. This article will break down common formats from major manufacturers. You will then be able to pinpoint the exact manufacturing month and year. This process turns a string of characters into meaningful information. It tells you exactly when your Kenmore dishwasher left the factory.

## Cracking the Code: Interpreting Kenmore Serial Number Formats

Interpreting the serial number for your Kenmore dishwasher requires knowing who made it. Since Kenmore uses several original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), their serial number formats differ. I will explain common patterns for the major brands that produce Kenmore appliances. This helps you identify the manufacturing date.

### Whirlpool/KitchenAid Made Kenmore Dishwashers

Many Kenmore dishwashers come from Whirlpool. This includes models also sold under brands like KitchenAid and Maytag. Whirlpool serial numbers often follow a specific structure. You will typically see a serial number with two letters followed by seven digits, like "FN1234567." The first letter indicates the plant. The second letter is important for the year. This letter corresponds to a year in a cyclical pattern. For instance, 'M' might be 2000, 'N' 2001, and so on.

The first two digits after the letters represent the week of manufacture (01-52). The next digit is often the last digit of the year. However, it is more reliable to use the letter code for the year. The last four digits are sequential production numbers. For example, a serial number like "FW3400012" could mean it was made in the 34th week of a certain year. You need a chart to match the letter 'W' to the correct year. Online tools and manufacturer websites often provide these charts.

### GE Appliances Made Kenmore Dishwashers

GE Appliances also manufactures many Kenmore dishwashers. Their serial numbers have a different format. GE serial numbers often start with two letters. These letters indicate the month and year of manufacture. For example, a serial number starting with "AL" would mean a specific month and year. The first letter represents the month (A=Jan, B=Feb, etc.). The second letter indicates the year (A=1970, B=1971, then restarting or using a different sequence for newer decades).

The system often cycles every 20 years. So, 'A' might be 1970, 1990, or 2010. You need to consider the age of your appliance to pick the right decade. The remaining digits are typically product sequence numbers. For instance, a serial number like "RZ123456G" means 'R' is a month and 'Z' is a year. You should consult a GE date code chart to get the exact year. Some charts are available on appliance parts websites.

### Electrolux/Frigidaire Made Kenmore Dishwashers

Electrolux, which also owns the Frigidaire brand, produces Kenmore dishwashers. Their serial numbers often use the first digit for the year. The next two digits indicate the week of manufacture. For instance, a serial number like "1F23456789" would suggest a manufacturing year ending in '1'. The 'F' might be a plant code. The '23' would then mean the 23rd week of that year.

This format is generally straightforward. However, like other manufacturers, Electrolux might have variations. Always verify with specific charts if possible. The important thing is to look for the first or second digit. It will usually correspond to the last digit of the manufacturing year. The following two digits will represent the week. This combination gives you the precise date. For example, if a serial number starts with 8E15XXXX, it means it was made in the 15th week of a year ending in 8 (like 2008 or 2018).

Remember, the key is to correctly identify the OEM. Then, apply their specific serial number decoding logic. This method will consistently reveal the manufacturing year of your Kenmore dishwasher.

## Beyond the Sticker: Alternative Ways to Determine Your Kenmore Dishwasher's Year

Sometimes, the sticker with the model and serial number is unreadable or missing. This can happen with very old appliances or due to wear and tear. Do not worry; there are still other ways to find "what year was my Kenmore dishwasher made." These methods might require a bit more digging. However, they can provide the information you need.

One of the easiest alternative methods is checking your original purchase receipts. If you bought the dishwasher new, the receipt will clearly show the purchase date. This date is usually very close to the manufacturing date. Sometimes, it might be a few months later, but it gives you a strong estimate of its age. Dig through old files or email archives for this proof of purchase. Many retailers send electronic receipts now, making this search simpler.

Another valuable resource is the owner's manual or installation guide. These documents often come with the appliance. They typically contain a section for recording the model and serial numbers. More importantly, they often include the copyright year of the manual itself. While not the exact manufacturing year, the copyright date gives you an idea. The appliance was made either in or shortly after that copyright year. For instance, a manual copyrighted in 2010 means your dishwasher was made in 2010 or later.

You can also use online databases. Many appliance parts websites let you enter a model number. They then show you parts breakdowns and sometimes manufacturing date ranges. Some forums or appliance enthusiast sites maintain lists of date codes. These resources can be helpful if you cannot find the direct serial number information. Additionally, if you registered your appliance for a warranty, the manufacturer might have your purchase date on file. Checking your online account with Sears or the OEM is a good idea. These methods help when the direct sticker decoding is not possible.

## Troubleshooting: When You Can't Find the Manufacturing Date on Your Kenmore

It can be frustrating when you cannot locate or read the manufacturing date on your Kenmore dishwasher. Despite searching, sometimes the sticker is gone, faded, or in an obscure spot. Do not give up hope. There are still steps you can take to figure out "what year was my Kenmore dishwasher made." These tips help you when the primary methods fail.

First, double-check all possible locations for the data plate. Some less common spots include the very top edge of the inner door. Also, look underneath the control panel or even on the back of the machine. You might need to gently pull the dishwasher out from the cabinet to check the back. Use a bright flashlight. Sometimes, dust and grime can obscure the sticker. A gentle cleaning might reveal the information.

If the sticker is truly unreadable, focus on the model number. Even without the serial number, the model number can provide clues. Kenmore model numbers often start with three digits, a dot, then more digits (e.g., 665.123456789). The first three digits before the dot usually identify the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). For example, "665" often indicates a Whirlpool-made Kenmore. "790" often points to Electrolux/Frigidaire. "363" might be GE. Once you know the OEM, you can search for "Whirlpool date codes" or "GE appliance age lookup." This approach helps narrow down the possibilities.

If all else fails, consider contacting Sears PartsDirect or a local appliance repair technician. Provide them with the full model number, even if you lack the serial number. They often have access to databases that can cross-reference model numbers with manufacturing date ranges. Some experienced technicians can even estimate an appliance's age based on its appearance or internal components. They might recognize specific design changes that occurred in certain years. They might also advise on common problems that arise with older machines, such as when you might need to address issues like [how to get mildew out of dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-mildew-out-of-dishwasher). This professional help can be the last resort for dating your dishwasher.

## Maintaining Your Kenmore Dishwasher Based on Its Age

Knowing the manufacturing year of your Kenmore dishwasher is valuable for maintenance planning. Older appliances often require different care than newer ones. Their components experience more wear and tear over time. Adjusting your maintenance routine based on age helps extend your dishwasher's life. It also helps you avoid unexpected breakdowns.

For example, an older dishwasher might benefit from more frequent deep cleaning cycles. Mineral deposits and food residues build up more over years of use. This can affect performance and cleanliness. Regular descaling and filter cleaning become even more important. You should also check hoses and seals more often on an older unit. These parts can become brittle or crack with age, leading to leaks.

If your Kenmore dishwasher is approaching or past its typical lifespan (around 10-12 years), consider proactive replacements for certain parts. Common parts like the wash pump, heating element, or door latch might wear out. Replacing these before they fail can prevent bigger problems. Knowing the age helps you anticipate these needs. For instance, an older machine might be more prone to issues like strange smells. This could be due to build-up or wear. Learning [how to get mildew out of dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-mildew-out-of-dishwasher) can become a more frequent task.

Ultimately, your dishwasher's age guides your decision on repair versus replacement. A minor repair on a newer machine is usually worth it. However, multiple costly repairs on an old unit might not be economical. Investing in a new, energy-efficient model could save money in the long run. Use the manufacturing date as a key factor in these important household decisions.
