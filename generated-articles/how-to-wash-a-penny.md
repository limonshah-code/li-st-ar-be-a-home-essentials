## How To Wash A Penny: Restore Shine Safely

Have you ever found an old, dull penny and wondered if its former shine could return? Many people simply let tarnished pennies sit unnoticed. But what if you could easily transform them? Learning **how to wash a penny** is a simple and satisfying task. It brings back their gleam, making them look almost new. This process can be fun for science experiments or for simply tidying up loose change. I will guide you through effective and safe methods. We will explore household items that make pennies sparkle. This article covers everything from basic washing steps to careful handling of older coins. You will learn how to make your pennies shine again.

### Takeaway:

*   Use acidic solutions like vinegar or lemon juice with salt to remove tarnish.
*   Rinse pennies thoroughly after washing to stop the chemical reaction.
*   Dry pennies completely to prevent immediate re-tarnishing.
*   Handle collectible pennies with extreme care; often, do not clean them.

To wash a penny, combine an acid like white vinegar or lemon juice with salt. Soak the penny in this solution for a few minutes. The acid reacts with the copper oxide (tarnish) on the penny's surface. This chemical reaction dissolves the grime. Then, scrub gently with a soft cloth or toothbrush. Rinse the penny well with water. Dry it completely to reveal a brighter, cleaner coin.

## Why Wash a Penny? Understanding Penny Tarnish

Pennies often look dirty and dull. This happens because of a process called tarnishing. Copper, the main metal in pennies, reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction creates copper oxide. Copper oxide is the dark, brownish-black layer you see on old pennies. It makes them lose their bright, coppery color. Washing a penny helps to remove this layer. It reveals the shiny copper underneath.

Some people wash pennies for fun science experiments. You can see a clear chemical reaction happening. Children often enjoy watching the transformation. Other people simply want to clean their loose change. A clean penny feels nicer to handle. It also looks better if you keep it in a coin jar or dish. Cleaning common pennies is usually safe. It does not reduce their value. For truly old or rare pennies, however, cleaning can be a mistake. It can lower their collector's value. Always consider the penny's age and rarity before you decide to wash it.

## Gather Your Supplies to Wash Pennies

Washing pennies does not require special tools. You likely have most items in your kitchen. This makes it an easy DIY project. You will need a few common household products. These items create the cleaning solution. They help remove the tarnish effectively. I always make sure to have everything ready before I start. This saves time and makes the process smooth.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Dull Pennies:** Choose a few dirty pennies to start with.
*   **Small Bowl or Dish:** A non-metal container is best. Plastic or glass bowls work well.
*   **White Vinegar:** This is a common household acid. It is very effective for cleaning copper.
*   **Table Salt:** Salt helps speed up the chemical reaction.
*   **Lemon Juice (Optional):** This is another acidic alternative to vinegar.
*   **Baking Soda (Optional):** Good for neutralizing acid and light scrubbing.
*   **Soft Cloth or Paper Towels:** For drying the pennies.
*   **Old Toothbrush or Cotton Swab:** For gentle scrubbing.
*   **Water:** For rinsing the pennies after cleaning.

Having these supplies ready ensures a successful penny washing session. You are now prepared to restore their shine.

## Step-by-Step: Washing Pennies with Vinegar and Salt

This method is the most popular and effective way to wash pennies. It uses a simple acid-salt combination. The acid dissolves the copper oxide. The salt helps the acid work faster. Follow these steps carefully to get the best results. I find this method works wonders on most common pennies. You will be amazed at how quickly they transform.

### Mixing the Solution

1.  **Pour Vinegar:** Add about a quarter cup of white vinegar into your small non-metal bowl.
2.  **Add Salt:** Stir in one teaspoon of table salt. Make sure the salt dissolves completely. This creates your cleaning solution.

### Soaking and Scrubbing

1.  **Place Pennies:** Carefully drop your dull pennies into the solution. Do not overcrowd the bowl. Make sure each penny is fully submerged.
2.  **Observe the Reaction:** You will notice bubbles forming. The pennies will start to brighten almost immediately. This is the acid reacting with the tarnish.
3.  **Soak Time:** Let the pennies soak for about 5-10 minutes. For very tarnished pennies, you might need a bit longer. However, avoid soaking for too long. Excessive soaking can damage the penny's surface.
4.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Remove one penny from the solution. Use an old toothbrush or cotton swab to gently scrub its surface. You will see the remaining tarnish come off easily.

### Rinsing and Drying

1.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Hold each penny under running water. Rinse away all traces of the cleaning solution. Any left-over acid can cause new tarnish.
2.  **Dry Completely:** Place the rinsed pennies on a soft, clean cloth or paper towel. Pat them dry thoroughly. Make sure there is no moisture left. Moisture leads to re-tarnishing. For general coin cleaning tips, explore [how to wash a coin](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-coin).

Following these steps will help you achieve sparkling clean pennies.

## Alternative Washing Methods for Pennies

While vinegar and salt work very well, other household items can also clean pennies. These methods use different acids. They offer good alternatives if you prefer a different approach or have specific ingredients on hand. I have tried several methods, and these are quite effective. They provide options for various situations.

### Lemon Juice and Salt

Lemon juice is another natural acid. It works similarly to vinegar.

1.  **Combine Ingredients:** Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice with one teaspoon of table salt in a small bowl.
2.  **Soak Pennies:** Place pennies in the mixture. Let them soak for 5-10 minutes.
3.  **Scrub and Rinse:** Gently scrub the pennies with a soft brush. Rinse them thoroughly with water. Dry them completely. This method is effective for removing light to moderate tarnish. It often leaves a fresh scent.

### Ketchup or Hot Sauce

These condiments contain vinegar and other mild acids. They can be surprisingly effective for spot cleaning.

1.  **Apply Directly:** Squeeze a small amount of ketchup or hot sauce onto a penny.
2.  **Rub and Wait:** Rub it around to cover the penny's surface. Let it sit for a few minutes. You might see the tarnish dissolve.
3.  **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse the penny well under running water. Dry it completely with a soft cloth. This method is good for a quick clean.

### Cola Soft Drinks

Cola drinks contain phosphoric acid. This acid can also break down tarnish.

1.  **Submerge Pennies:** Place pennies in a glass of cola.
2.  **Soak Overnight:** Let them soak overnight. The reaction is slower than with vinegar or lemon juice.
3.  **Rinse and Dry:** In the morning, remove the pennies. Rinse them thoroughly and dry completely. This is a passive cleaning method.

Each of these alternatives can help you achieve bright, clean pennies. Always remember to rinse and dry thoroughly. For more specific advice on maintaining copper, see our guide on [how to clean copper penny](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-copper-penny).

## Washing Old or Collectible Pennies

Cleaning collectible pennies requires extreme caution. Unlike common pocket change, old or rare pennies can lose significant value if cleaned improperly. Collectors prefer coins with their original "patina." Patina is the natural aging process that creates a protective layer. This layer tells the coin's history. Removing it can damage the coin's surface. It can also make it look unnatural. This reduces its appeal to serious collectors.

I strongly advise against cleaning any penny you suspect might have numismatic value. A common date penny from recent decades is usually safe to clean. But if you have a penny from the early 1900s, or one with a special mint mark, think twice. Here are some guidelines:

*   **Research First:** Before doing anything, research the penny's date and mint mark. Use online resources or coin collecting guides. Determine its potential rarity and value.
*   **Consult an Expert:** If you are unsure, show the coin to a professional coin dealer or appraiser. They can assess its condition and offer advice. They can tell you if cleaning would harm its value.
*   **Avoid Abrasives:** Never use abrasive materials on collectible coins. This includes polishes, harsh brushes, or rough cloths. These can scratch the surface. Such damage is irreversible.
*   **No Chemicals:** Strong chemicals can strip the coin of its original surface. They can leave permanent discoloration. This is particularly true for older copper coins.

For any coin you are unsure about, the best approach is to do nothing. Preserve its original state. This protects its historical and monetary value. You can learn more about general coin care by visiting our article on [how to wash a coin](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-coin).

## Drying and Storing Your Washed Pennies

After you wash a penny, drying and proper storage are crucial steps. Skipping these can lead to immediate re-tarnishing. Copper reacts quickly with oxygen and moisture. A damp penny will start to tarnish again very fast. This makes all your cleaning efforts useless. I have seen many people clean coins only to have them dull again within days. Proper drying prevents this. It ensures your pennies stay bright for longer.

### Drying Process

1.  **Thorough Rinsing is Key:** First, ensure you have rinsed every trace of the cleaning solution off the penny. Any residual acid will accelerate re-tarnishing.
2.  **Pat Dry:** Place each penny on a soft, clean cloth or paper towel. Gently pat it dry. Do not rub vigorously. This could leave microscopic scratches.
3.  **Air Dry (Optional, with caution):** You can let the pennies air dry for a short period after patting. Make sure the air is clean and dust-free. However, complete immediate drying is generally safer.
4.  **Avoid Heating:** Do not use heat to dry your pennies. High temperatures can cause discoloration. It can also accelerate future tarnishing.

### Proper Storage

Once completely dry, how you store your pennies matters.

*   **Airtight Containers:** Store cleaned pennies in airtight containers or plastic bags. This limits their exposure to air and moisture.
*   **Coin Flips or Holders:** For pennies you want to keep nice, use non-PVC coin flips or archival-safe holders. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) can react with coins over time. This causes damage.
*   **Cool, Dry Place:** Store your containers or holders in a cool, dry environment. Avoid areas with high humidity or extreme temperature changes. Basements or attics are often not ideal.

Following these drying and storage tips will help maintain the shine of your freshly washed pennies.

## What Not to Use When Washing Pennies

Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to use. Certain substances and methods can permanently damage pennies. They can reduce their appearance. For collectible coins, using the wrong cleaner can destroy their value. Even for common pennies, harsh treatments can cause irreversible harm. I always advise against these methods to protect the coin's surface.

Here are things you should never use to wash a penny:

*   **Abrasive Cleaners:** Avoid anything that scrapes or scratches the coin. This includes steel wool, abrasive scouring pads, or gritty powders. These will leave visible marks on the copper. These scratches are permanent.
*   **Harsh Chemicals:** Do not use strong industrial cleaners, bleach, or ammonia-based products. These chemicals can react harshly with copper. They can cause discoloration, pitting, or irreversible damage to the coin's surface. They are also dangerous to handle.
*   **Polishing Cloths with Abrasives:** Some polishing cloths contain fine abrasives. These are designed for other metals. They can strip away the coin's surface. This changes its original appearance.
*   **Coin Polishes:** Specific coin polishes exist, but they are generally not recommended. They often remove a microscopic layer of metal. This can make the coin look unnaturally shiny. This is called "stripping." Stripped coins have little value to collectors.
*   **Tumbling or Vibrating Cleaners:** Devices used for cleaning jewelry or other metal items might seem appealing. However, they can cause micro-abrasions across the coin's surface. This results in an unnatural, dull finish.
*   **Heat:** Do not bake, boil, or apply direct heat to pennies. Heat can cause irreversible changes to the copper. This includes discoloration and damage to the coin's structure.

Always stick to the mild, acidic solutions like vinegar or lemon juice with salt. These are effective without causing damage.

## Common Questions About Washing Pennies

People often have questions about cleaning coins. It is good to clarify common concerns. Knowing the answers helps you make informed decisions about your pennies. I have gathered some frequently asked questions. My goal is to provide clear, concise answers.

### Can washing a penny decrease its value?

Yes, washing a penny can decrease its value, especially for old or rare coins. Collectors prefer coins with their original patina, which cleaning removes. For common modern pennies, cleaning generally does not affect monetary value, but it can make them look too shiny or "unnatural" to some. Always identify a penny's rarity before cleaning.

### How long does the shine last after washing a penny?

The shine after washing a penny is temporary. Copper reacts with oxygen in the air, causing it to re-tarnish. This process can start within hours or days. Proper rinsing and airtight storage can slow down re-tarnishing significantly. Storing them in a cool, dry place helps maintain their shine longer.

### What is the science behind washing a penny?

Washing a penny uses a simple acid-base reaction. The tarnish on a penny is copper oxide, a base. Acids like vinegar or lemon juice react with this copper oxide. This reaction creates new compounds that dissolve in water. This removes the dark layer. The salt acts as an electrolyte, speeding up the chemical reaction.

### Can I use dish soap to wash a penny?

Dish soap alone is not effective for removing tarnish from pennies. It can clean off surface dirt and grime, but it will not react with the copper oxide that causes the dark, dull appearance. For tarnished pennies, you need an acidic solution combined with salt to see a significant change in shine.

### Is washing pennies safe for children?

Washing pennies can be a fun and educational activity for children. It demonstrates a chemical reaction. Always supervise children closely during the process. Ensure they do not ingest the cleaning solution. Make sure they wash their hands thoroughly afterward. Use mild solutions like vinegar or lemon juice.

### What causes pennies to turn green?

Pennies turn green due to a process called verdigris. This is a type of copper corrosion. It happens when copper reacts with moisture and carbon dioxide over a long time. It creates a green-blue patina. This is different from the dark tarnish (copper oxide) and is more difficult to remove without damaging the coin.

## Conclusion

Learning **how to wash a penny** is a simple yet rewarding skill. You can transform dull, tarnished coins into shiny pieces with common household items. We explored using vinegar and salt, lemon juice, or even ketchup. Each method offers a way to remove the copper oxide that causes tarnish. Remember to always rinse your pennies thoroughly. Drying them completely is also crucial. This prevents immediate re-tarnishing.

While cleaning common pennies is safe and fun, always exercise caution with old or collectible coins. Improper cleaning can permanently reduce their value. Knowing what to avoid, such as harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, is vital for coin preservation. I hope this guide helps you brighten your pennies safely and effectively. Now you can easily make your loose change sparkle!
