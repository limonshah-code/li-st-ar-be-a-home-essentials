## Cleaning Your Toms: How To Wash Them In The Washing Machine

Are your favorite Toms looking a bit dull and dirty? You probably wear them often, which means they collect dirt and grime. Many people wonder if their beloved canvas shoes can survive a trip through the washing machine. Good news! You can absolutely wash Toms in the washing machine. It makes cleaning them easy and effective.

This guide provides simple steps to machine wash your Toms properly. I will walk you through preparing your shoes, choosing the right detergent, and selecting the best wash settings. You will also learn about drying techniques and how to keep your Toms looking fresh for a long time. Let us get those Toms sparkling clean again!

### Takeaway

*   **Prepare Toms:** Remove loose dirt, laces, and insoles before washing.
*   **Protect Shoes:** Place Toms in a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Use Gentle Products:** Choose a mild detergent and avoid harsh chemicals.
*   **Select Cold Water:** Wash on a delicate cycle with cold water.
*   **Air Dry:** Always air dry Toms away from direct heat or sunlight.

To wash Toms in the washing machine, first remove laces and insoles, then brush off loose dirt. Place them in a mesh laundry bag with a few towels. Wash on a cold, delicate cycle using a mild detergent. Finally, air dry them completely to prevent damage and odor.

## Preparing Your Toms for Machine Washing

Getting your Toms ready before they go into the washing machine is a crucial step. This preparation helps to protect both your shoes and your appliance. Taking a few minutes now can prevent damage and ensure a better clean. I always start with this stage to ensure success.

First, remove any large clumps of dirt or debris from the shoes. You can use a soft brush or an old toothbrush for this job. Gently scrub the canvas and soles to dislodge stubborn grime. This step prevents dirt from spreading inside your washing machine.

Next, remove the laces from your Toms. Laces can tangle during the wash cycle and might not get as clean if left attached. You can wash them separately by hand or place them in a small mesh bag with the shoes. If your Toms have removable insoles, take those out as well. Insoles often need separate cleaning or air drying to prevent moisture buildup and odors.

Finally, place your Toms inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag acts as a protective barrier during the wash cycle. It stops the shoes from banging against the machine drum, which can cause damage to both the shoes and the washing machine. I often throw a few old towels into the machine with the shoes. These towels provide cushioning and help balance the load. This simple addition further protects your shoes from harsh impact during agitation.

## Choosing the Right Detergent and Supplies

Selecting the correct cleaning products is very important when you decide to wash Toms in the washing machine. The wrong detergent can damage the fabric or leave residue. My rule is always to choose products that are gentle yet effective. This approach protects the color and material of your Toms.

Opt for a mild liquid detergent. Harsh detergents, especially those with bleach or strong chemicals, can fade the color of your canvas Toms. They might also break down the adhesive that holds the shoe together. Look for detergents labeled "gentle" or "delicate." Some people prefer to use eco-friendly or natural detergents, which are often free from harsh additives.

Avoid using powdered detergents. Powder can sometimes clump and not dissolve properly in cold water, leaving white residue on your shoes. Liquid detergents dissolve more easily and rinse away cleaner. You only need a small amount of detergent for a pair of Toms. Using too much creates excessive suds and makes rinsing difficult.

For stubborn stains, consider spot treating them before the main wash. You can use a small amount of laundry detergent mixed with water to create a paste. Apply it to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, then gently scrub with a soft brush. This pre-treatment significantly improves the chances of removing tough marks. Never use bleach directly on your Toms, as it can severely damage the fabric and color. If you are dealing with particularly smelly shoes, adding a half cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle can help neutralize odors. Vinegar is a natural deodorizer and is safe for most fabrics.

## Selecting the Best Washing Machine Settings for Toms

Choosing the right settings on your washing machine is critical to avoid damaging your Toms. You want a cycle that is gentle and uses cool water. This prevents shrinking, fading, and deterioration of the shoe materials. I always double-check these settings before starting the wash.

Set your washing machine to a "delicate" or "gentle" cycle. These cycles have a slower spin speed and less agitation, which is perfect for items like shoes. Some machines even have specific "hand wash" or "extra gentle" settings that work well. Avoid using normal or heavy-duty cycles, as these are too harsh for fabric shoes like Toms. They can cause your shoes to lose their shape or fray.

Always use cold water. Hot water can cause the canvas fabric to shrink or the colors to bleed. It can also weaken the glue that holds the shoe soles in place. Cold water cleans effectively without these risks. It is also better for the environment and saves energy. Many modern washing machines offer specific "cold wash" options, which are ideal.

Make sure to set the spin speed to low. A high spin speed can put excessive stress on the shoes, potentially distorting their shape or damaging the drum of your washing machine. A low spin speed helps remove excess water without being too aggressive. After the cycle finishes, your Toms will still be quite damp, but that is normal. Different washing machines might have slightly different names for these settings.

## Loading Your Toms into the Washing Machine

Loading your washing machine correctly helps ensure your Toms get clean without damage. Proper loading balances the machine and protects your shoes. I always take care during this step to prevent problems. It helps the wash cycle run smoothly.

After placing your Toms in a mesh laundry bag, put them into the washing machine drum. Do not simply toss them in loosely. The mesh bag keeps them contained and prevents them from clanking against the sides of the drum. This protection is vital for both your shoes' longevity and the machine's safety.

It is a good idea to add a few old towels or a couple of blankets to the load. These soft items provide cushioning for your Toms. They prevent the shoes from banging around too much during the wash and spin cycles. This cushioning reduces noise and minimizes impact on the shoes. Using towels also helps to balance the washing machine load. An unbalanced load can cause the machine to shake excessively, which is not good for its components.

Distribute the items evenly inside the drum. Do not overload the machine. Overloading prevents proper agitation and rinsing, meaning your Toms will not get as clean. It can also strain your washing machine. A standard front-loading or top-loading machine can usually handle one or two pairs of Toms with a couple of towels comfortably. Always ensure the machine is not too full, allowing space for items to move freely. This simple step protects your shoes and ensures a thorough clean. You can compare this process to how you might wash other fabric items like Keds; our article on [can you wash Keds in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-keds-in-the-washing-machine) offers similar advice.

## Drying Your Toms After Washing Machine Cleaning

Drying your Toms properly after washing is just as important as the washing process itself. Incorrect drying can lead to shrinkage, damage, or unpleasant odors. I always emphasize air drying to preserve the shape and quality of the shoes. This step requires patience but is worth it.

Never put your Toms in a tumble dryer. The high heat from a dryer can cause the canvas to shrink significantly. It can also melt the glue that holds the soles to the fabric, leading to permanent damage. The dryerâ€™s tumbling action can also distort the shape of the shoes. This type of damage is often irreversible.

The best way to dry your Toms is to air dry them. After removing them from the washing machine, reshape them gently. You can stuff the toes with paper towels or clean old socks to help them maintain their original form as they dry. This prevents the shoes from becoming misshapen. Replace the paper towels if they become too damp.

Find a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or extreme heat. Placing them outside on a cloudy day or indoors near a fan works well. Direct sunlight can fade the color of your Toms. Excessive heat from radiators or heaters can also cause shrinkage. Air circulation is key to quick and even drying. It can take 24 to 48 hours for Toms to dry completely, depending on humidity and airflow. Make sure they are completely dry before wearing them or putting them away. Wearing damp shoes can cause new odors or mildew to form.

## Tips for Keeping Your Toms Clean Longer

Keeping your Toms clean between washes reduces the need for frequent machine cleaning. This helps extend their life and keeps them looking good. I have a few simple habits that really make a difference. These tips save time and effort in the long run.

First, wipe down your Toms regularly. After each wear, especially if you have walked through dusty or muddy areas, quickly wipe off any surface dirt. A damp cloth or a soft brush works well for this. This prevents dirt from setting into the canvas fabric. Consistent spot cleaning means fewer major washes.

Consider applying a fabric protector spray to your Toms. These sprays create a barrier on the canvas that repels water and stains. This makes it harder for dirt and liquids to penetrate the fabric, making them easier to clean. Reapply the protector periodically, especially after washing. Always follow the product instructions for best results.

Store your Toms properly when you are not wearing them. Keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Avoid throwing them into a pile with other shoes where they can get dirty or crushed. Using shoe trees or stuffing them with newspaper can help maintain their shape during storage. Proper storage prevents dust accumulation and shape distortion.

Rotate your shoes. Do not wear the same pair of Toms every single day. Giving your shoes a break allows them to air out completely between wears. This helps prevent odors and reduces wear and tear on the fabric. Having a few pairs to rotate extends the life of each. These practices are simple but highly effective in maintaining the cleanliness and appearance of your Toms.

## Troubleshooting Common Toms Washing Issues

Even with the best intentions, you might run into a few issues when washing Toms. Understanding how to handle these common problems helps you get the best results. I have encountered these issues myself and know how to fix them. A little knowledge goes a long way.

One common issue is lingering odors after washing. Sometimes, despite washing, a faint smell remains. This often happens if the shoes did not dry completely or if the initial odor was very strong. To combat this, try adding half a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle during the next wash. Vinegar is excellent for neutralizing odors. Ensure the shoes dry thoroughly in a well-ventilated area for at least 48 hours. You can also sprinkle baking soda inside the dry shoes overnight to absorb remaining smells.

Another problem can be the appearance of yellowing or residue on the canvas after drying. This usually happens if the shoes were not rinsed completely or if too much detergent was used. Hard water can also leave mineral deposits. To fix this, re-wash the Toms using only cold water and no detergent. Make sure to select an extra rinse cycle. If hard water is an issue, consider adding a water softener to your wash. This will help prevent mineral buildup.

Sometimes, Toms might seem slightly stiff after drying. This is normal for canvas fabric. Gently flex and wear them to help soften the material. You can also rub the canvas with your hands to break down any stiffness. If the shoes lost some shape, re-stuff them with paper or shoe trees while they are damp. This helps them regain their original form as they dry. Patience is key with canvas shoes. Knowing these solutions helps you overcome minor setbacks and keep your Toms looking great.
