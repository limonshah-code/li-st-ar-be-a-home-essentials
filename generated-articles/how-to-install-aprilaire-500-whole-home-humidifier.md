## Choosing the Right Spot: Ideal Aprilaire 500 Placement

Selecting the correct location for your Aprilaire 500 is very important. The placement affects how well the humidifier works. It also impacts the ease of installation and future maintenance. Consider both technical requirements and practical access. I always look for a spot that is easy to reach but also effective.

The Aprilaire 500 is a bypass humidifier, meaning it needs two connections to your HVAC system. It typically mounts on the supply (warm air) plenum or the return (cold air) plenum of your furnace. Both locations work effectively. However, mounting on the supply plenum often provides slightly better performance. This is because the warm air can absorb more moisture. You can learn more about specific duct options by reading articles like [Can Aprilaire Humidifier Be Installed On Return Duct](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-aprilaire-humidifier-be-installed-on-return-duct).

When choosing, look for a flat section of ductwork large enough for the humidifier unit. Ensure there is enough space around the unit for maintenance access later. You will need room to connect water lines, drain lines, and electrical wiring. Also, check for nearby access to a water supply line and a drain. A floor drain or utility sink is ideal for the drain line. The humidistat, which controls the humidifier, usually mounts on the return duct.

### Key Considerations for Placement:
*   **Duct Type:** Mount on either the supply (warm air) or return (cold air) plenum.
*   **Flat Surface:** Choose a flat, stable section of ductwork.
*   **Clearance:** Ensure at least 6-8 inches of clearance around the unit for access.
*   **Water Access:** Locate near a cold-water line (e.g., utility sink, washing machine line).
*   **Drain Access:** Ensure a nearby floor drain, utility sink, or condensate pump.
*   **Humidistat Location:** The humidistat should be on the return air duct or a wall in the living space, not too close to the furnace.
*   **Bypass Connection:** Plan the bypass duct run, keeping it as short and straight as possible.

Think about the path for the bypass duct. It connects the humidifier to the opposite plenum. For example, if the humidifier is on the supply, the bypass duct connects to the return. Keep this duct run minimal. This planning ensures your Aprilaire 500 operates at peak efficiency.

## Mounting the Humidifier and Ductwork Connections

Once you choose the perfect spot, the physical installation begins. Securely mounting the humidifier unit is a crucial first step. Proper mounting ensures stability and a good seal. I always double-check my measurements before cutting anything. This prevents mistakes.

Start by marking the humidifier's footprint on your selected ductwork. The Aprilaire 500 kit comes with a template for this purpose. Tape the template to the duct. Use a pencil to trace the outline of the humidifier opening and screw holes. Precision here saves effort later. After marking, use your tin snips to cut the large opening for the humidifier. Make sure your cut is clean and smooth.

Next, attach the humidifier to the duct. Place the humidifier over the cut opening. Line up the mounting holes with your markings. Use self-tapping sheet metal screws to secure the unit firmly to the duct. Make sure it is level and tightly sealed against the ductwork. Apply duct sealant or foil tape around the edges if needed. This prevents air leaks and ensures all air flows through the humidifier.

### Steps for Mounting and Ductwork:
1.  **Attach Template:** Tape the provided template to the chosen duct location.
2.  **Mark and Cut:** Use a pencil to trace the opening and screw holes. Carefully cut the opening with tin snips.
3.  **Mount Humidifier:** Position the Aprilaire 500 over the opening. Use self-tapping screws to secure it.
4.  **Seal Edges:** Apply duct sealant or foil tape around the humidifier's base for an airtight seal.
5.  **Install Bypass Duct Collar:** On the opposite plenum, mark and cut a 6-inch diameter hole for the bypass duct collar. Secure the collar with screws.
6.  **Connect Bypass Duct:** Measure and cut the bypass duct to length. Connect it between the humidifier and the bypass duct collar. Use hose clamps or screws to secure the duct.
7.  **Seal Bypass Connections:** Seal all connections on the bypass duct with foil tape or sealant.

Now, connect the bypass duct. This 6-inch duct links the humidifier to the opposite plenum. For example, if your humidifier is on the supply duct, the bypass duct runs to the return duct. Cut a 6-inch hole in the opposing duct and install the bypass duct collar. Then, connect the flexible bypass ducting between the humidifier and the collar. Ensure all connections are secure and sealed. This setup allows furnace air to flow through the humidifier and return to the main airflow.

## Connecting Water and Drain Lines

Connecting the water supply and drain lines is a critical step. These connections provide water to the humidifier and remove excess. Correct plumbing prevents leaks and ensures the humidifier functions properly. I always double-check all connections before turning on the water.

Start by tapping into a cold-water line. A saddle valve is commonly used for this. Choose a copper pipe that is at least 1/2 inch in diameter. Install the saddle valve according to its instructions. It punctures the pipe to create a water tap. Alternatively, you can use traditional plumbing fittings for a more secure, permanent connection. Run 1/4-inch copper or flexible PEX tubing from the saddle valve to the humidifier's water inlet. Ensure the tubing is cut to the correct length and connected securely. Do not overtighten fittings.

Next, connect the drain line. The Aprilaire 500 has a drain outlet that removes water not absorbed by the air. Run flexible plastic tubing (typically 1/2 inch) from the humidifier's drain outlet to a suitable drain. A floor drain, utility sink, or condensate pump are common options. Ensure the drain line has a continuous downward slope. This allows gravity to carry the water away. If there's no downward slope, water can sit in the line and cause problems.

### Steps for Water and Drain Connections:
1.  **Water Supply Tap:** Install a saddle valve on a cold-water line (1/2 inch copper pipe recommended).
2.  **Run Water Line:** Connect 1/4-inch copper or PEX tubing from the saddle valve to the humidifier's water inlet.
3.  **Secure Water Connections:** Use appropriate fittings and tighten carefully to prevent leaks.
4.  **Connect Drain Line:** Attach 1/2-inch flexible plastic tubing to the humidifier's drain outlet.
5.  **Route Drain Line:** Run the drain line with a continuous downward slope to a suitable drain (floor drain, utility sink, or condensate pump).
6.  **Secure Drain Line:** Use hose clamps to secure the drain tubing. Ensure no kinks or obstructions in the line.

Once all connections are made, slowly open the water supply valve. Check for any leaks at the saddle valve and the humidifier inlet. Address any leaks immediately before proceeding. A properly installed drain line prevents water damage and ensures efficient operation. After installation, you will want to understand how to keep it working well, so look up resources like [How To Clean Aprilaire Humidifier Filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-aprilaire-humidifier-filter).

## Wiring the Aprilaire 500 for Power

Wiring is often the most intimidating step for many people. However, it is straightforward with careful attention to detail. The Aprilaire 500 requires low-voltage wiring for its operation. This connects the humidifier to your furnace's control board and the humidistat. Always turn off power to your furnace before starting any wiring. Safety is paramount when dealing with electricity.

The Aprilaire 500 typically uses an 18-gauge thermostat wire. You will run wires from the humidifier to the humidistat. Then, run wires from the humidistat to your furnace's control board. Most furnaces have a 24-volt transformer and terminals marked "HUM" or "G" and "C" for humidifier connections. Consult your furnace's wiring diagram for exact terminal locations. I always label my wires before connecting them. This helps keep things clear.

The humidistat acts as the control center. It senses the humidity level in your home and tells the humidifier when to turn on or off. Mount the humidistat on the return air duct or on a wall in the main living area. If mounted on the duct, ensure it is not too close to the furnace itself. Connect the humidifier's two wires to the "HUM" or "H" terminals on the humidistat. Then, connect wires from the humidistat's "R" and "C" (or "G" and "C") terminals to the corresponding 24V terminals on your furnace control board.

### Wiring Steps:
1.  **Turn Off Power:** Locate your furnace's circuit breaker and turn off the power. Confirm it is off.
2.  **Mount Humidistat:** Install the humidistat on the return duct or desired wall location.
3.  **Wire Humidifier to Humidistat:** Run two 18-gauge wires from the Aprilaire 500 to the humidistat's "HUM" or "H" terminals.
4.  **Wire Humidistat to Furnace:** Run two 18-gauge wires from the humidistat's "R" and "C" (or "G" and "C") terminals to the corresponding 24V terminals on your furnace control board.
5.  **Make Connections:** Strip wire ends and secure them to terminals using wire nuts where appropriate. Ensure all connections are tight.
6.  **Verify Wiring Diagram:** Double-check your connections against the wiring diagram provided with your Aprilaire 500 and furnace.

After making all electrical connections, replace any access panels on your furnace. Then, you can restore power to the furnace. Incorrect wiring can damage components. If you are unsure, consult a qualified HVAC technician. Taking your time with this step is essential for proper function and safety.
