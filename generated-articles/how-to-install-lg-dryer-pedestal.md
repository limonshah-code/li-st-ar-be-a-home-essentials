## Easily Install Your LG Dryer Pedestal

Have you ever wished your dryer was just a little bit taller? Maybe you need more storage in your laundry room. Installing an LG dryer pedestal solves both of these issues. This simple project improves ergonomics and adds valuable space. I will walk you through each step of the process. You can enhance your laundry experience with confidence.

### Takeaway:

*   **Gather Tools First:** Collect all necessary items before starting.
*   **Prioritize Safety:** Disconnect power and get help for lifting.
*   **Follow LG Instructions:** Always refer to your specific model's manual.
*   **Level for Stability:** Ensure the pedestal and dryer are perfectly level for quiet operation.

Installing an LG dryer pedestal involves securing the pedestal to the base of your LG dryer using provided brackets and screws, then carefully positioning the elevated appliance. This process typically requires lifting assistance and ensuring all connections, including the dryer vent and power, are properly reattached and checked for stability after leveling.

## Why Install an LG Dryer Pedestal? Discover the Benefits

Installing an LG dryer pedestal offers several significant advantages. The primary benefit is improved ergonomic height. This means less bending over to load and unload laundry. Your back will thank you. Pedestals also reduce strain on your knees and hips.

Beyond comfort, LG dryer pedestals provide convenient storage. Many models come with a spacious pull-out drawer. This drawer is perfect for holding laundry detergents, fabric softener, and other supplies. It keeps your laundry area neat and organized. This added storage helps declutter countertops and shelves.

Pedestals can also help reduce dryer vibration. The extra height and solid base add stability. This can lead to quieter operation. A stable dryer experiences less movement during cycles. This creates a more peaceful laundry environment. An LG dryer pedestal is a smart addition to any laundry room.

## Selecting the Right LG Dryer Pedestal

Choosing the correct LG dryer pedestal is a crucial first step. LG designs pedestals to fit specific dryer models. You must check your dryer's model number. This ensures the pedestal you buy is compatible. A mismatch can lead to instability or incorrect fitting.

LG pedestals come in various colors to match your appliance. Common colors include white, graphite steel, and black stainless steel. Select a color that complements your dryer and laundry room decor. This creates a cohesive and attractive look. The right aesthetic enhances your home.

Consider the drawer features of the pedestal. Some pedestals offer deeper drawers for larger items. Others might have internal dividers for better organization. Think about what you plan to store in the drawer. Your storage needs will guide your selection. Ensure the pedestal meets your functional requirements.

## Essential Tools and Materials for Pedestal Installation

Before you begin installing your LG dryer pedestal, gather all the necessary tools and materials. Having everything ready saves time and effort. You will need a Philips head screwdriver for most screws. A level is essential to ensure your dryer sits evenly. This prevents wobbling and noise during operation.

You will also need work gloves to protect your hands. A moving dolly or furniture glides are highly recommended. These tools make moving the heavy dryer much easier and safer. A sturdy blanket or cardboard can protect your floor from scratches. Place it under the dryer as you move it.

Always refer to your specific LG dryer pedestal installation manual. It lists the exact hardware included and any special tools. Typically, the pedestal comes with mounting brackets and screws. Make sure all parts are present before you start. Missing components can halt your project.

## Preparing Your Laundry Space for Pedestal Installation

Proper preparation of your laundry space is key for a smooth installation. First, disconnect your dryer from its power source. Unplug electric dryers from the wall outlet. For gas dryers, turn off the gas supply valve and disconnect the gas line. Safety is your top priority when working with appliances.

Next, disconnect the dryer vent hose. This hose typically connects to the dryer's back. Remove any clamps or screws holding it in place. Carefully pull the hose away from the dryer. Now, clean the area around and behind your dryer. You can learn how to [How to Clean LG Dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer) before moving it. This ensures a clean space for the pedestal.

Clear a path to move the dryer. You will need ample space to tilt and maneuver the appliance. Consider moving any nearby obstacles like laundry baskets or shelves. If possible, have someone assist you. Dryers are heavy and awkward to move alone. This step ensures safety and ease of access.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Attaching the Pedestal to Your LG Dryer

Attaching the pedestal to your LG dryer requires careful attention to detail. Start by laying the dryer on its front or side on a protective blanket. This position gives you easy access to the dryer's underside. Make sure the dryer is stable in this position. Gently tilt it onto its padded side.

Next, position the LG dryer pedestal on the floor near the dryer. The pedestal should be oriented correctly, with the drawer facing the same direction as the dryer's door. Align the pedestal's top edge with the dryer's base. Most LG pedestals have alignment guides or holes. These help you match up the two units perfectly.

Now, attach the mounting brackets. LG pedestals come with specific brackets that secure the dryer to the pedestal. Fasten these brackets using the screws provided in your pedestal kit. Typically, you will screw the brackets into the dryer's frame and the pedestal's frame. Ensure all screws are tight. This creates a secure connection.

Double-check all connections before standing the dryer upright. Ensure the pedestal is firmly attached and there is no wobbling. With the help of another person, carefully lift the dryer and pedestal assembly. Place it upright in its final location. Take your time during this step to prevent injury or damage.

## Placing and Leveling Your LG Dryer with Pedestal

Once your LG dryer and pedestal are securely attached, move the combined unit to its final position. Carefully slide it into place, making sure there is enough clearance behind for the vent hose. Avoid dragging the unit directly to prevent floor damage. Use furniture glides or a dolly if needed.

Connect the dryer vent hose. Ensure the hose is not kinked or crushed. A clear vent path is essential for dryer performance and safety. Secure the vent hose with a clamp. Make sure it forms a tight seal. A proper vent connection is vital for efficient drying. You can also refer to [How to Install an Electric Dryer Vent](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-an-electric-dryer-vent) for detailed instructions on this critical step.

Next, level the dryer and pedestal assembly. LG pedestals often have adjustable feet. Use a wrench to turn these feet up or down. Place a level on top of the dryer, checking both side-to-side and front-to-back. Adjust the feet until the dryer is perfectly level. This prevents excessive vibration and noise during operation.

Finally, reconnect the power supply. Plug the electric dryer back into the wall outlet. If you have a gas dryer, reconnect the gas line and turn the gas supply back on. Check for any gas leaks using a soap and water solution. Bubbles indicate a leak. Run a test cycle to ensure everything works correctly. This final check confirms successful installation.

## Post-Installation Checklist and Maintenance Tips

After successfully installing your LG dryer pedestal, take a moment for a final check. Ensure all connections are secure. Run an empty cycle on your dryer. Listen for unusual noises or excessive vibration. A properly installed and leveled unit runs smoothly.

Regular maintenance extends the life of your dryer and pedestal. Keep the pedestal drawer clean. Remove any lint or debris that might accumulate inside. This keeps the drawer operating smoothly. A clean drawer maintains its function and appearance.

Remember to clean your dryer's lint filter after every use. This is crucial for dryer efficiency and safety. Periodically, you should also clean the exhaust vent. A clogged vent reduces performance and poses a fire hazard. Learn more about [How to Clean Filter on LG Dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-on-lg-dryer) for proper maintenance.

### How much height does an LG dryer pedestal add?

### How do I know if my LG dryer is level after installing the pedestal?
To check if your LG dryer is level after installing the pedestal, place a carpenter's level on top of the dryer. Check the level from side to side and from front to back. Adjust the pedestal's leveling feet until the bubble on the level is centered in all directions.
