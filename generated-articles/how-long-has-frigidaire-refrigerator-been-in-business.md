## The Birth of Frigidaire: Early Innovations in Refrigeration

The story of the Frigidaire refrigerator begins in 1916. Alfred Mellowes created the first self-contained refrigerator. He called it the "Guardian Frigerator." This was a breakthrough. Most refrigerators at the time used ice. Mellowes' invention used electricity for cooling.

General Motors saw the potential in this new device. They bought Mellowes' company in 1918. GM renamed the company "Frigidaire." This marked the official start of the Frigidaire brand. They quickly began to mass-produce these electric refrigerators.

Early Frigidaire refrigerators changed home kitchens. They offered a more reliable way to store food. People no longer needed to buy ice regularly. This saved time and effort. Frigidaire became a household name for refrigeration. People even started using "frigidaire" as a general term for any refrigerator, just like "Kleenex" for tissues. This shows the brand's early impact. It also cemented its place in appliance history.

GM invested heavily in research and development. This helped Frigidaire improve its cooling technology. They made units more efficient and user-friendly. The initial models were large and expensive. Over time, Frigidaire worked to make them more accessible. These efforts laid the foundation for the modern refrigerator industry. The company focused on quality and innovation from the very beginning.

## The General Motors Era: Dominance and Expansion

General Motors owned Frigidaire for many decades. This period, from 1918 to 1979, saw great growth for the Frigidaire refrigerator. GM provided large resources. This helped Frigidaire become a dominant force in the appliance market. They built large factories. They also invested in extensive advertising campaigns.

Frigidaire introduced many firsts during this time. They released the first home refrigerator with a separate freezer compartment in 1926. This was a major step. It allowed people to store frozen foods for longer periods. This innovation made home life much easier. They also introduced color options for refrigerators. This allowed consumers to match their appliances to their kitchen decor.

Frigidaire's reach extended beyond just refrigerators. They also made other home appliances. These included washing machines, ranges, and air conditioners. This broadened their product line.

During the mid-20th century, Frigidaire refrigerators were common in many American homes. The brand stood for reliability and modern living. It was a time when appliances were transforming daily life. Frigidaire played a big part in this transformation. Their products were known for their quality construction. This era set Frigidaire apart as a leader in the appliance industry. Their legacy from this time still influences their designs today.

After World War II, appliance demand grew. Frigidaire met this demand with new features. They introduced automatic defrost systems. This feature removed the need for manual defrosting. It was a huge convenience for homeowners. Earlier models required users to turn off the fridge and melt ice buildup. This new system saved time and effort.

## Changing Hands: The Electrolux Acquisition
