## How To Get Rid Of New Mattress Smell: A Comprehensive Guide

Getting a new mattress is exciting. You anticipate better sleep and a fresh start in your bedroom. However, that excitement can quickly turn to concern when a strong, distinct odor fills your room. This "new mattress smell" is a common issue many people face.

This odor comes from a process called off-gassing. Materials in the mattress release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air. While these compounds are generally harmless in the levels found in mattresses, the smell can be unpleasant. It can also disrupt your sleep and cause mild irritation for some individuals.

I understand how frustrating it is to have your new bed smell. My own experience with a new memory foam mattress taught me the importance of proper ventilation. This article will guide you through effective, simple methods to get rid of the smell from your new mattress. We will cover everything from basic airing techniques to powerful natural odor neutralizers.

### Takeaway

*   **Ventilate Immediately:** Unpack your new mattress and place it in a well-ventilated room for several days.
*   **Use Baking Soda:** Sprinkle baking soda generously over the mattress surface to absorb odors.
*   **Harness Sunlight:** If possible, expose the mattress to direct sunlight outdoors to accelerate off-gassing.
*   **Employ Activated Charcoal:** Place activated charcoal bags near the mattress to absorb lingering smells.
*   **Be Patient:** Mattress odors can take days or even weeks to fully dissipate, so consistent effort is key.

To get rid of the smell from a new mattress, unbox it immediately and allow it to air out in a well-ventilated room for several days, preferably with open windows and a fan. For persistent odors, sprinkle baking soda over the entire surface, let it sit for several hours or overnight, then vacuum thoroughly. Repeating these steps helps neutralize common off-gassing smells.

### Understanding New Mattress Smell and Off-Gassing

Many new products have a distinct smell. New mattresses are no exception. This odor is often called "new mattress smell" or "off-gassing." It happens when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released into the air from the materials used in the mattress.

Mattresses contain various synthetic and natural components. These can include polyurethane foam, adhesives, fire retardants, and fabrics. When these materials are new, they release gases. This release causes the noticeable smell.

The smell is generally harmless for most people. VOC levels from mattresses are usually very low. However, some individuals might experience mild symptoms. These can include headaches, nausea, or respiratory irritation. It is important to address the smell for comfort and peace of mind.

Different mattress types can have varying smells. Memory foam mattresses are often known for a stronger initial odor. This is due to the specific chemicals in the viscoelastic foam. Other mattresses, like hybrids or innerspring, might have lighter smells.

Understanding the source helps you know why certain methods work. Our goal is to dissipate these VOCs safely. We want to remove the smell quickly so you can enjoy your new bed. Rest assured, this is a common and solvable issue.

### Initial Steps for Effective Mattress Ventilation

The very first and most crucial step in getting rid of new mattress smell is proper ventilation. As soon as your new mattress arrives, unbox it. Remove all plastic packaging immediately. This allows the mattress to breathe and begin the off-gassing process.

Place the mattress in a room with good airflow. If possible, choose a spare room or a space that can be isolated. Open all windows in the room as wide as possible. This creates a cross-breeze.

Using a fan can significantly speed up ventilation. Position a fan near an open window to draw air out of the room. You can also place a fan in the room to circulate air directly over the mattress. This helps disperse the VOCs into the outdoor air.

Allow the mattress to air out for several days before you sleep on it. The longer it airs, the better. Some people find that 48 to 72 hours is sufficient. Others might need a full week or more, especially for memory foam or bed-in-a-box mattresses. I personally set up my new mattress in a guest room for a few days before moving it into my bedroom.

During this period, avoid putting on sheets or mattress protectors. Keep the mattress as exposed as possible. This maximizes the surface area for off-gassing. Good initial ventilation is the foundation for eliminating the smell.

If you have other new items that might off-gas, like a new rug, consider airing them out in a similar fashion. Just like with a new mattress, [getting rid of new rug smell](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-rid-of-new-rug-smell) often starts with ventilation. This simple step makes a big difference.

### Natural Remedies: Using Baking Soda for Odor Absorption

Baking soda is a powerful natural deodorizer. It works by absorbing odors rather than masking them. This makes it an excellent solution for getting rid of new mattress smell. I always have a box of baking soda on hand for various cleaning needs.

To use baking soda, first, ensure your mattress is free of any coverings. Liberally sprinkle a thick layer of baking soda over the entire surface of the mattress. Do not skimp on the amount. Focus on areas that seem to have a stronger smell.

Allow the baking soda to sit on the mattress for an extended period. For best results, leave it for at least 12 to 24 hours. Some people even leave it for a few days if the smell is very strong. The longer it sits, the more odors it can absorb.

After the waiting period, vacuum up all the baking soda thoroughly. Use a brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner to ensure you remove all residue. Pay close attention to seams and crevices where powder might hide. You can find useful tips on how to effectively [clean stains off mattress with baking soda](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-off-mattress-with-baking-soda), which often use similar vacuuming techniques.

If the smell persists, you can repeat this process. Flip the mattress if possible and treat the other side as well. Baking soda is safe, inexpensive, and highly effective. It is one of my go-to methods for freshness.

This method is especially useful for foam mattresses, as they can trap odors. It is a gentle yet powerful way to neutralize unwanted smells. When learning [how to clean a foam mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-foam-mattress) for general freshness, baking soda is almost always recommended.

### Harnessing the Power of Sunlight and Fresh Air

Sunlight and fresh air are natural sanitizers and deodorizers. They can be incredibly effective in helping to get rid of smell from a new mattress. UV rays from the sun can break down organic compounds. Fresh air carries away lingering odors.

If you have an outdoor space like a balcony, deck, or yard, consider taking your new mattress outside. Choose a sunny, dry day. Lay the mattress flat or prop it up against a clean surface. Ensure it is not directly on the ground.

Allow the mattress to air out in the sunlight for several hours. You can even leave it out for a full day if weather permits. Make sure to check the weather forecast. You do not want the mattress to get wet. Moisture can lead to mold or mildew problems, which create their own unpleasant smells.

If moving the mattress outside is not an option, maximize natural airflow indoors. Keep windows open in the mattress's room constantly. Use fans to direct air movement. A box fan placed in a window facing outwards can draw stale air out of the room.

Combine sunlight exposure with other methods. For example, you can sprinkle baking soda on the mattress while it is outside in the sun. This dual action can significantly speed up the deodorizing process. The more fresh air and natural light your mattress gets, the faster the new smell will disappear.

Remember that patience is key. It might take a few days of consistent airing to notice a significant improvement. My personal experience confirms that direct sunlight makes a huge difference. It is a powerful, natural tool in your fight against new mattress odors.

### Activated Charcoal and Other Odor Absorbers

Beyond baking soda, activated charcoal is another highly effective odor absorber. Activated charcoal is porous. It has millions of tiny holes that trap odor molecules. This makes it excellent for neutralizing smells, including those from a new mattress.

You can buy activated charcoal in various forms. Look for activated charcoal bags or canisters. These are specifically designed for air purification and odor removal. Place several bags directly on the surface of your mattress. You can also put them around the bed frame.

Allow the activated charcoal to sit for several days. It works continuously to pull odors from the mattress and the surrounding air. For a stronger effect, you can even place charcoal inside a mattress protector for a short period, if you have one.

Other natural absorbers can also help. Small bowls of white vinegar can absorb odors. Place a few bowls around the room, not directly on the mattress. Vinegar is known for its odor-neutralizing properties. Be careful not to spill it, as it can damage the mattress material. You might find a similar approach helpful if you are trying to [get vinegar smell out of carpet](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-vinegar-smell-out-of-carpet) after a cleaning mishap.

Coffee grounds are another option. Place fresh coffee grounds in open containers near the mattress. The strong scent of coffee can help mask and absorb other odors. However, this is more of a temporary solution compared to charcoal or baking soda.

These additional absorbers complement ventilation and baking soda. They provide continuous odor removal. Using a combination of these methods gives you the best chance of quickly getting rid of that new mattress smell. I often use activated charcoal bags in my closets and they work wonders.

### Addressing Specific Mattress Types: Memory Foam and Others

Different mattress types can off-gas differently. Understanding your mattress material helps you tailor your approach to odor removal. Memory foam mattresses are often the biggest culprits for new mattress smell. This is due to the specific viscoelastic polymers used in their construction.

When you buy a memory foam mattress, expect a more pronounced odor initially. The smell usually dissipates over time. However, it can be stronger and linger longer than other types. For a memory foam mattress, I recommend maximum ventilation. Unroll it in a well-ventilated room immediately. Allow it to air out for several days, possibly even a week or more, before sleeping on it. Consistent air circulation is key. If you're wondering [how to clean a memory foam mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-memory-foam-mattress) for general hygiene, remember that airing is a primary step there too.

Hybrid mattresses combine memory foam with innerspring coils. They might have a moderate off-gassing smell from the foam layers. The ventilation methods still apply effectively. Innerspring mattresses, being mostly metal coils and fabric, tend to have the least off-gassing smell. Their odor is often from the fabric treatments or packaging.

Latex mattresses, especially natural latex, might have a faint, sweet, or rubbery smell. This is natural to the material. It is generally not considered off-gassing of synthetic VOCs. This natural scent typically fades quickly. Ensure you know if your latex mattress is natural or synthetic, as synthetic latex can have a more chemical odor.

No matter the type, avoid sealing a new mattress in plastic once unpacked. This traps the VOCs. If the smell is very strong or you are sensitive, consider sleeping elsewhere for a few nights. This gives the mattress more time to air out. Patience is particularly important with memory foam.

Regularly cleaning and maintaining your mattress can also prevent future odors. Knowing [how to deep clean your mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-deep-clean-your-mattress) can ensure it remains fresh long after the new smell is gone.

### Patience and Prevention: Long-Term Mattress Freshness

Getting rid of the smell from a new mattress takes time and consistent effort. Do not expect the odor to vanish overnight. For most mattresses, the initial strong smell will diminish significantly within a few days to a week. However, some lingering faint odors might persist for several weeks. This is normal.

Continue to ventilate the room regularly, even after the initial off-gassing period. Open windows when weather permits. This helps maintain fresh air circulation. You can also use a fan periodically to keep the air moving.

Consider using a mattress protector once the smell has largely dissipated. A good quality, breathable mattress protector can shield your mattress from spills and dust. It can also help keep it fresh in the long run. Choose one that allows for airflow.

Regular mattress maintenance helps prevent new odors from developing. Vacuum your mattress every few months. This removes dust mites and dead skin cells. Dust mites can contribute to unpleasant smells over time. I vacuum my mattress every time I change the sheets.

Flipping or rotating your mattress according to manufacturer instructions also promotes even wear and airflow. This can help with overall freshness. If you ever need to clean up spills or accidents, address them immediately. Prompt cleaning prevents odors from setting in.
