This income compares to the top earners in smaller combat sports or unique competitions. For instance, some pro arm wrestlers or cornhole players also see varying income levels. Their top athletes make good money.

The challenge for pillow fighting is to expand its commercial appeal. Increased broadcast deals and major corporate sponsorships will boost salaries across the board.
