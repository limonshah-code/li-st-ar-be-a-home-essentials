## Can You Wash Throw Pillows for a Fresher Home?

Throw pillows bring comfort and style to any living space. They add color, texture, and a cozy feel to your sofa or bed. Over time, these decorative items collect dust, dirt, pet dander, and spills. Many people wonder, "Can you wash throw pillows?" The answer is often yes, but it depends on the pillow's material and construction. Proper cleaning extends their life and keeps your home looking and smelling fresh. Understanding how to care for them prevents damage and maintains their appearance. This article provides a comprehensive guide to cleaning your throw pillows safely and effectively. We will cover identifying washable materials, proper cleaning methods, and essential drying techniques.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Care Labels First:** Always read the care label before washing throw pillows.
*   **Separate Covers and Inserts:** Wash covers separately if they are removable.
*   **Pre-Treat Stains:** Address specific spots before full washing.
*   **Choose Correct Method:** Machine wash, hand wash, or spot clean based on fabric.
*   **Dry Completely:** Ensure pillows are fully dry to prevent mold and mildew.

Yes, you can wash throw pillows, but the method varies greatly. Most throw pillow covers are washable, either by machine or hand. Pillow inserts, especially those made of synthetic fibers or down, can often be washed. However, some materials like memory foam or delicate embellishments require special spot cleaning or professional care.

## Understanding Throw Pillow Care Labels

Your throw pillow’s care label is your most important guide. It provides specific instructions from the manufacturer. Ignoring these labels can lead to damage, shrinkage, or discoloration. Take a moment to locate and read the label before you begin any cleaning process. These small tags offer crucial details about the fabric type and recommended cleaning methods.

Care labels use symbols to tell you how to wash, bleach, dry, iron, and dry clean. A picture of a wash tub indicates machine washing. A hand in a tub means hand washing. A circle means dry clean only. A crossed-out symbol means "do not" perform that action. For example, a crossed-out wash tub means "do not wash." If your pillow has no label, you must proceed with caution. Test a small, hidden area first if you are unsure about the fabric's reaction to water or detergent. This simple step helps prevent damage to your decorative pillows.

### Decoding Common Symbols

Knowing common laundry symbols helps you clean your throw pillows correctly. These symbols are universal and guide you through the washing process. A basic understanding saves your pillows from harm. Look for the wash tub, triangle, square, iron, and circle symbols.

*   **Wash Tub:** This symbol tells you about washing. Dots inside indicate water temperature. One dot means cold water, two dots mean warm water, and three dots mean hot water. A line under the tub shows the gentle cycle. Two lines mean a very gentle cycle. A hand in the tub means hand wash. A cross over the tub means do not wash.
*   **Triangle:** This symbol refers to bleaching. An empty triangle means you can use any bleach. A triangle with diagonal lines means non-chlorine bleach only. A crossed-out triangle means do not bleach. Bleach can damage certain fabrics and colors.
*   **Square:** This symbol provides drying instructions. A circle inside a square indicates tumble drying. Dots inside the circle show the dryer heat setting. One dot is low heat, two dots are medium, and three dots are high. A line under the square means permanent press. Two lines mean delicate. A crossed-out square means do not tumble dry. A square with a horizontal line means flat dry. A square with a vertical line means drip dry.
*   **Iron:** This symbol tells you how to iron. Dots on the iron indicate the iron temperature. One dot is low heat, two dots are medium, and three dots are high. A crossed-out iron means do not iron.
*   **Circle:** This symbol relates to dry cleaning. An empty circle means dry clean. A crossed-out circle means do not dry clean. Specific letters inside the circle provide instructions for professional cleaners.

Understanding these symbols makes cleaning your throw pillows simple. Always prioritize the instructions on the label. This helps maintain the pillow's look and feel for years. Proper care helps your home stay fresh and appealing.

## Preparing Your Throw Pillows for Washing

Preparation is key to a successful cleaning process. It helps protect your throw pillows and ensures a thorough clean. Skipping these steps can lead to uneven cleaning or damage. Proper preparation makes the washing process easier and more effective.

Start by assessing each pillow. Check for any loose threads, tears, or embellishments. If you find any damage, repair it before washing. This prevents further damage during the cleaning cycle. Remove any attached decorations like buttons or beads if possible. These items can get caught in the washing machine or cause rips.

### Separating Covers and Inserts

Many throw pillows come with removable covers. This design makes cleaning much simpler. Always remove the cover from the pillow insert if possible. The insert and cover often require different cleaning methods. Washing them separately prevents damage to both components.

Zip or button up any zippers or closures on the covers before washing. This prevents snagging and helps maintain the cover's shape. Pillow inserts, especially those with delicate fillings, should be handled with care. Some inserts might be washable, while others need spot cleaning. Check the insert’s label as well. Keeping them separate ensures each part receives the correct care. This separation prevents bulk in the washer and allows both parts to dry completely.

### Pre-Treating Stains

Stains are a common issue for throw pillows. Pre-treating stains before washing improves the chances of full removal. Different stains require different approaches. Act quickly when a spill happens to prevent the stain from setting. Fresh stains are always easier to remove than old ones.

For most common stains like food or drinks, use a mild stain remover. Apply a small amount directly onto the stained area. Gently rub it in with a clean cloth or soft brush. Do not rub too hard, as this can spread the stain or damage the fabric fibers. For oil-based stains, sprinkle baking soda or cornstarch on the spot. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes to absorb the oil. Then brush off the powder.

Always test your stain remover on an inconspicuous area first. This checks for colorfastness or potential damage to the fabric. Follow the product instructions for best results. Pre-treatment significantly boosts the effectiveness of your main wash cycle. This step makes your throw pillows look new again.

## Machine Washing Throw Pillow Covers Safely

Machine washing is convenient for many throw pillow covers. It is a quick and efficient way to clean them. However, not all covers are suitable for machine washing. Always refer to the care label before placing covers in the machine. Cotton, linen, and many synthetic covers are often machine washable. Delicate fabrics like silk, velvet, or heavily embellished covers usually require hand washing or dry cleaning.

If your cover is machine washable, use the right settings. Overloading the machine can prevent proper cleaning. It also puts stress on the fabric. Wash covers in small batches to ensure they move freely. This allows detergent and water to penetrate all areas. Machine washing covers can make them look fresh and vibrant.

### Choosing the Right Cycle and Detergent

Selecting the correct wash cycle and detergent is crucial for machine washing throw pillow covers. Using the wrong settings can shrink, fade, or damage the fabric. Gentle care ensures your covers last longer. Pay attention to both the fabric type and the level of dirt.

For most throw pillow covers, a gentle or delicate cycle is best. This cycle uses less agitation, protecting the fabric fibers and any decorative elements. Cold water is usually recommended for throw pillows. Cold water helps prevent color bleeding and shrinkage. It also uses less energy, which is good for the environment. For whites or heavily soiled covers, warm water might be an option if the care label allows.

Use a mild, color-safe detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach unless specifically instructed on the care label. For dark or vibrant colors, a detergent designed for colors helps maintain brightness. Measure the detergent carefully according to the product instructions. Too much detergent can leave residue, while too little may not clean effectively. Using the correct products and settings helps keep your [decorative pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-arrange-throw-pillows-on-sofa) looking their best. If you are washing regular bed pillows, the same principles apply. You can find more details on general pillow washing in our guide [Can You Wash Pillows in Washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-pillows-in-washer).

### Loading the Washer Correctly

Loading your washing machine properly helps ensure a thorough clean. It also protects your throw pillow covers from damage. Do not just toss everything in. Careful loading makes a difference in the outcome.

Wash throw pillow covers separately from other laundry items. This prevents zippers or buttons from snagging other clothes. It also prevents colors from bleeding onto other fabrics. Place the covers in a mesh laundry bag, especially if they have delicate details or zippers. The mesh bag provides an extra layer of protection during the wash cycle.

Avoid overfilling the washing machine. Covers need space to move freely in the water and detergent. An overloaded machine will not clean effectively. It also puts undue stress on your washing machine and the fabrics. Distribute the covers evenly in the drum. This helps balance the load and ensures a proper spin cycle. Proper loading contributes to cleaner, longer-lasting throw pillow covers.

## Hand Washing Delicate Throw Pillows and Inserts

Some throw pillows or their inserts are too delicate for machine washing. Hand washing provides a gentle alternative. This method is suitable for fabrics like silk, rayon, or those with delicate embellishments. It is also ideal for pillow inserts that might lose their shape in a machine. Hand washing gives you more control over the cleaning process.

Before starting, gather your supplies. You will need a clean basin or bathtub, mild detergent, and clean towels. Ensure your space is clean to avoid transferring more dirt. Hand washing extends the life of fragile items. It keeps your cherished throw pillows in good condition.

### Gentle Cleaning for Fragile Fabrics

Hand washing requires a gentle touch. This method helps preserve the integrity of delicate fabrics. Rough handling can stretch, tear, or damage the material. Treat these items with care.

Fill a clean basin or bathtub with cool or lukewarm water. Add a small amount of mild, pH-neutral detergent. Swirl the water to dissolve the detergent. Submerge the throw pillow cover or insert gently into the soapy water. Avoid aggressive scrubbing or twisting motions. Gently squeeze the item multiple times to allow the soapy water to penetrate. Focus on areas with visible dirt or stains. Let the item soak for 10-15 minutes, but no longer. Prolonged soaking can damage certain fibers. This gentle process helps lift dirt without harming the fabric.

### Submerging and Rinsing

After the initial wash, thorough rinsing is essential. Leftover soap residue can attract dirt or irritate skin. Proper rinsing ensures your throw pillow is truly clean. This step removes all traces of detergent.

Drain the soapy water from the basin. Refill the basin with clean, cool water. Submerge the throw pillow item again. Gently squeeze it to release the dirty water and soap. Repeat this rinsing process several times. Continue until the water runs clear and no soap bubbles remain. Do not wring or twist the item forcefully. This can distort its shape or damage the fabric. Instead, gently press the water out. Once rinsed, carefully lift the item from the water. Support its weight to prevent stretching. This careful approach protects your delicate throw pillows. If you have ever wondered [how to clean pillows in a bathtub](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-pillows-in-bathtub), this is the general process.

## Cleaning Non-Washable Throw Pillow Inserts (Spot Cleaning & Airing)

Not all throw pillow inserts are fully washable. Some materials, like memory foam or solid foam, cannot withstand a full water immersion. Water can damage their structure or encourage mold growth. If your insert’s care label says "spot clean only" or "dry clean," respect those instructions. For these cases, spot cleaning and airing are the best options. These methods help refresh your pillows without full immersion.

Even if you cannot fully wash an insert, you can still keep it clean. Regular spot checks and airing prevent dirt and odors from building up. This keeps your non-washable inserts fresh. Pay attention to common areas where dirt accumulates.

### Spot Cleaning Foam and Down Alternatives

Spot cleaning is ideal for foam, memory foam, or down alternative inserts. It targets specific dirty areas without saturating the entire pillow. This method is gentle and effective for minor spills or marks. Always test your cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area first.

For foam or memory foam, mix a small amount of mild detergent with water. Use a clean white cloth. Dampen the cloth with the solution. Gently blot the stained area. Do not rub, as this can push the stain deeper. Continue blotting until the stain lifts. For down or down alternative inserts, a similar gentle blotting method works. Be careful not to wet the filling too much.

After cleaning, use another clean cloth dampened with plain water. Blot the area again to remove any soap residue. Then, use a dry cloth to blot up as much moisture as possible. Allow the spot-cleaned area to air dry completely. Place the pillow in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight, which can damage some foam materials. Ensure the spot is fully dry before putting the cover back on. This prevents mildew and odors. If you are cleaning other foam pillows, like bed pillows, these same techniques apply. Our article on [how to clean foam pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-foam-pillows) provides more detail.

### Refreshing with Air and Baking Soda

Even inserts that cannot be washed benefit from regular refreshing. Airing and using baking soda can remove odors and minor dust. This simple practice keeps your throw pillows smelling fresh. It also helps reduce allergens.

Take your throw pillow inserts outdoors on a dry, sunny day. Hang them on a clothesline or place them on a clean surface. Allow them to air out for several hours. Sunlight helps kill bacteria and removes odors naturally. If outdoor airing is not possible, place them near an open window. Good air circulation is key.

For stubborn odors, baking soda is an excellent natural deodorizer. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the entire pillow insert. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or even a few hours. The baking soda absorbs odors. After sitting, use a vacuum cleaner with an upholstery attachment to thoroughly vacuum up the baking soda. This process leaves your pillow inserts smelling clean and refreshed. Regular airing and baking soda treatments extend the freshness of your non-washable throw pillows. It also contributes to a cleaner home environment.

## Drying Throw Pillows and Inserts Correctly

Proper drying is as important as proper washing. Incorrect drying can lead to mold, mildew, or damage to your throw pillows. Incomplete drying can also cause unpleasant odors. Take your time with this step to ensure your pillows stay fresh and last longer. The method of drying depends on the pillow component and its material.

Never put a damp throw pillow back on your sofa or bed. This creates a breeding ground for mildew. Always ensure everything is completely dry before reassembling. This attention to detail protects your investment.

### Tumble Drying Pillow Covers

Many machine-washable throw pillow covers can be tumble dried. This is a quick and convenient drying method. However, you must use the correct settings. Overheating can cause shrinkage, fading, or damage to the fabric. Always check the care label for specific dryer instructions.

For most covers, use a low heat or air fluff setting. High heat can damage delicate fabrics or cause colors to fade. Remove the covers from the dryer while they are still slightly damp. This helps prevent wrinkles and excessive shrinkage. You can then air dry them completely.

To help the covers dry evenly and prevent creases, toss a few dryer balls into the dryer. Dryer balls also help fluff up the fabric. Do not overload the dryer. Covers need space to tumble freely for even drying. Once dry, smooth out any wrinkles and prepare to reassemble your pillows.

### Air Drying Inserts and Delicate Materials

Air drying is the safest method for delicate throw pillow covers and most inserts. This gentle approach prevents heat damage and helps maintain shape. It takes longer than machine drying but offers superior protection. This is especially true for down, feather, or synthetic fiber inserts.

After hand washing or spot cleaning, gently press excess water from the pillow or cover. Do not wring or twist. Place delicate covers flat on a clean, dry towel. Roll the towel and pillow cover together to absorb more moisture. Then, unroll and lay the cover flat on a drying rack. Ensure good airflow around the item.

For inserts, place them on a clean, dry surface or a sturdy drying rack. Rotate and fluff them periodically to promote even drying. This prevents moisture from collecting in one spot. A fan can speed up the drying process. Ensure the area is well-ventilated. It might take several hours or even a day for thicker inserts to dry completely. Feel the pillow carefully to ensure no damp spots remain before putting the cover back on.

## Maintaining Freshness and Longevity of Your Throw Pillows

Regular cleaning extends the life and beauty of your throw pillows. But maintenance goes beyond just washing. Daily habits can significantly impact their freshness and longevity. Think of it as preventative care for your decorative items. A little effort each day keeps them looking new.

Maintaining freshness also contributes to a healthier home environment. Clean pillows reduce allergens and dust. They also make your living space more inviting. These simple steps ensure your throw pillows remain a highlight of your decor.

### Regular Fluffing and Spot Checks

Fluffing your throw pillows regularly helps maintain their shape and loft. It also redistributes the filling, preventing flat spots. This simple action makes your pillows look fuller and more inviting. Make it a daily habit.

When fluffing, gently pat and knead the pillow. Turn it over and do the same on the other side. You can also hold two opposite corners and push them together. This helps air circulate through the filling. As you fluff, do a quick spot check for new stains or spills. Address any new marks immediately. Fresh stains are much easier to remove than old, set-in ones. This proactive approach saves you from larger cleaning tasks later. Regular fluffing and quick spot checks keep your pillows looking their best.

### Protecting Your Pillows

Protecting your throw pillows prevents frequent heavy cleaning. There are several ways to keep them cleaner between washes. This reduces wear and tear from washing cycles. It also helps them stay new for longer.

Consider using pillow protectors, especially for inserts. These thin, zippered covers provide a barrier against spills, dust, and allergens. They are usually machine washable and much easier to clean than the pillow insert itself. If you have children or pets, a protector is a good investment.

Rotate your throw pillows regularly. This ensures even wear and tear across all sides. It also exposes different parts to light and air. Avoid placing pillows in direct sunlight for prolonged periods, as this can fade colors. For pillows not in use, store them in breathable bags in a cool, dry place. This prevents dust accumulation and protects them from moisture. Implementing these protective measures will extend the life and beauty of your throw pillows.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: How often should I wash my throw pillow covers?
**A1:** The frequency depends on use and household conditions. For high-traffic areas or homes with pets and children, wash covers every 1-3 months. Less used pillows might only need washing every 6-12 months. Regular spot cleaning and airing can extend the time between full washes. Always check the care label for specific instructions.

### Q2: Can I wash a throw pillow if it doesn't have a removable cover?
**A2:** Yes, but carefully. If the care label allows, hand wash the entire pillow in a basin. For non-washable materials like solid foam or memory foam, spot clean only. You can also air out the pillow and use baking soda to absorb odors. Always test any cleaning solution on a small, hidden area first.

### Q3: What kind of detergent should I use for throw pillows?
**A3:** Use a mild, pH-neutral detergent for most throw pillow covers and inserts. For colored fabrics, choose a color-safe detergent to prevent fading. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach unless explicitly stated on the care label. Delicate fabrics like silk or wool may require a specialized gentle detergent.

### Q4: How do I remove stubborn stains from my throw pillows?
**A4:** Act quickly. For most stains, pre-treat with a mild stain remover or a mixture of gentle detergent and water. Blot the stain; do not rub. For grease stains, apply baking soda or cornstarch to absorb oil, then vacuum. Always test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area first.

### Q5: Can I put throw pillow inserts in the dryer?
**A5:** It depends on the insert material. Synthetic fiber inserts often can be tumble dried on low heat with dryer balls. Down or feather inserts may also be dried on low heat, but require frequent fluffing to prevent clumping. Memory foam and solid foam inserts should never go in a dryer; they must be air dried completely. Check the care label for guidance.

### Q6: What if my throw pillow says "dry clean only"?
**A6:** If the care label clearly states "dry clean only," it is best to follow that instruction. Attempting to wash it at home can damage the fabric, cause shrinkage, or ruin its shape. Take such pillows to a professional dry cleaner for safe and effective cleaning. Spot cleaning may be an option for very minor surface marks.

## Conclusion

Keeping your throw pillows clean is a simple way to maintain a fresh and inviting home. We have learned that the answer to "Can you wash throw pillows?" is generally yes, but with important caveats.

Choosing the right cycle and detergent for machine-washable covers, or employing a gentle touch for hand washing, protects your pillows. For non-washable inserts, spot cleaning and airing out with baking soda prove highly effective. Most importantly, ensure your throw pillows and inserts are completely dry before reuse. This prevents mold and mildew. By following these guidelines, you can keep your throw pillows looking vibrant and feeling fresh for years. Regular care not only extends their life but also contributes to a cleaner, healthier living space for everyone to enjoy. Start cleaning your throw pillows today and enjoy a fresher home.
