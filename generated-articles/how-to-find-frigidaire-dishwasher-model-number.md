## Locate Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Model Number Easily

Have you ever faced a problem with your Frigidaire dishwasher? Perhaps you need to order a new part, schedule a repair, or check if your appliance is still under warranty. To do any of these, you first need a key piece of information: your Frigidaire dishwasher model number. Finding this number can seem like a treasure hunt, but it does not have to be difficult.

This article provides a simple guide to help you find your Frigidaire dishwasher model number. We will show you common spots where Frigidaire places this important tag. Knowing where to look will save you time and frustration. By the end, you will know exactly how to get the details you need for any Frigidaire dishwasher service or query.

### Takeaway:

*   **Check the Inner Door Frame:** This is the most common spot for the model number tag.
*   **Inspect Door Edges:** Look on the top or side edges of the dishwasher door.
*   **Examine the Control Panel:** Sometimes the tag is near the controls.
*   **Review Documentation:** Your owner's manual or purchase receipt can list the number.

To find your Frigidaire dishwasher model number, start by opening the dishwasher door fully. Look along the edges of the inner door, inside the door frame, or on the sides of the tub. The model number is usually on a sticker or rating plate here. It is a unique identifier needed for service and parts.

### Why Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Model Number Matters

Your Frigidaire dishwasher model number is more than just a series of letters and digits. It is a specific identifier for your appliance. This number tells technicians exactly which version of the dishwasher you own. Different models have different components and features.

When you need a replacement part, the model number ensures you get the correct one. A wrong part will not fit or work properly. For instance, a part for an older model may not fit a newer one. Using the correct model number prevents errors and saves you money.

The model number also helps with warranty claims. Frigidaire uses this number to verify your appliance's purchase date and warranty status. Without it, you cannot prove your dishwasher is covered. This means you might pay for repairs that should be free.

Troubleshooting issues becomes easier with the model number. Online resources and repair guides often provide solutions specific to certain models. If you contact customer support, they will ask for this number first. It helps them provide accurate advice and faster service. This information also proves useful for [how to find Frigidaire oven model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-frigidaire-oven-model-number) and when looking up parts for other Frigidaire appliances, such as your [how to find Frigidaire refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-frigidaire-refrigerator-model-number). Knowing where to find it simplifies appliance ownership.

### Common Locations for the Frigidaire Dishwasher Model Tag

Frigidaire usually places the model and serial number tag in easy-to-find spots. These locations are standard across many of their appliance lines. Knowing these common areas helps you find the information quickly. Most often, the tag is inside the dishwasher itself.

The most frequent location is along the inner edge of the dishwasher door. When you open the door, look around the perimeter of the tub opening. The sticker might be on the side, top, or bottom edges of this frame. It is often a white or silver sticker with black text.

Another common spot is on the side of the dishwasher tub itself. This is still inside the appliance, but on the left or right wall. You might need to pull out the bottom rack to get a clearer view. The tag is usually small but clearly visible.

Sometimes, the tag can be on the backside of the outer door panel. This is less common but still possible. You would need to open the door fully and look at the part that faces outwards when the door is closed. Always start by checking the interior edges first, as those are the most common places for a quick find. These general rules apply for other brands too, such as when you need to [find your LG dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-lg-dishwasher-model-number).

### Checking the Inner Door Frame

The inner door frame is the most common place to find your Frigidaire dishwasher model number. This location makes sense because it is easily accessible but still protected from daily use. Most Frigidaire dishwashers have the label here. I always start my search in this spot when helping friends or family.

To check this area, first open your dishwasher door completely. Let it lie flat. Now, look along the entire perimeter of the opening. The label is usually a small, rectangular sticker. It contains both the model number and the serial number.

The sticker might be on the top edge of the inner door. It could also be on the left or right side edge of the inner door. Sometimes it is on the bottom edge, though this is less common. Use a flashlight if the kitchen lighting is poor. The numbers are often printed in a small font.

Be sure to write down both the model number and the serial number. The serial number is unique to your specific appliance. The model number identifies the product line. Both are important for service calls, parts orders, and warranty checks.

### Inspecting the Side or Top of the Door

While the inner door frame is primary, Frigidaire also places model number tags on other parts of the door assembly. The side or top edges of the door itself are good secondary locations. These spots are still easy to reach without moving the appliance. I have seen many older Frigidaire models with the tag here.

Open the dishwasher door fully, as if you were loading it. Look along the narrow edges of the door. The sticker might be on the very top edge, where it meets the counter. It could also be on the side edge, close to the hinge.

Sometimes, the tag is visible only when the door is slightly ajar. Try opening the door halfway and looking. The sticker might be tucked into a seam or a less obvious spot. Run your hand along the edges to feel for a raised sticker.

The sticker is usually made of durable material. It can withstand moisture and heat from the dishwasher. However, over time, it might become faded or worn. If you cannot read it clearly, try taking a picture with your phone and zooming in. This often helps to clarify faint print. Remember to check both the left and right sides, as well as the top. This comprehensive search covers most door-related locations.

### Looking at the Tub Edges and Control Panel

If the door itself does not reveal the model number, expand your search to the dishwasher tub. The edges of the tub are another common area for Frigidaire to place identification tags. These spots are still inside the appliance, making them accessible. I have found many tags on the tub sides when the door proved empty.

Start by pulling out both the upper and lower dish racks. This gives you a clear view of the entire tub interior. Look along the metal or plastic edges where the door seals against the tub. The sticker might be on the left or right side of the tub, near the opening.

Sometimes, the tag is very low on the tub, near the filter or drain area. You might need to crouch down or use a flashlight to see it clearly. The material of the tub itself can hide the tag if it blends in. Be thorough in your search.

Less commonly, the model number can be on the control panel. This is usually on the inside edge of the control panel, facing the tub. If your control panel is on the top edge of the door, look underneath it. This spot is rare but worth a quick check if other locations yield no results. Keep a notepad ready to jot down the numbers as soon as you find them.

### Checking the Back or Bottom of the Appliance

When all internal locations fail, you might need to check the exterior of your Frigidaire dishwasher. The back or bottom of the appliance can sometimes house the model number tag. This usually means pulling the dishwasher out from its cabinet space. This step requires more effort but can be the last resort.

First, ensure the dishwasher is disconnected from power. Unplug it from the wall outlet or trip the circuit breaker. This is for your safety. Next, carefully slide the dishwasher out from its installed position. You might need help, as dishwashers are heavy.

Once exposed, look at the entire back panel. The tag could be near the water inlet or drain hoses. It might be on a metal plate or a sticker. Also, check the bottom of the appliance. Some manufacturers place identification tags on the base.

This method is less ideal for casual checks. It is usually reserved for situations where the appliance needs repair and must be moved anyway. If you cannot find the tag inside, consider if you truly need it right now. For parts or minor troubleshooting, internal checks are usually enough. If you own another brand, such as a [KitchenAid dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-kitchenaid-dishwasher-model-number), you may also need to check similar areas.

### Understanding Frigidaire Model and Serial Numbers

Once you find the tag, you will see two main sets of numbers: the model number and the serial number. It is important to know the difference between them. Both are vital for different purposes. Confusion between the two is common.

The model number identifies the product line. All Frigidaire dishwashers of the same specific design share the same model number. For example, a "FFID2426TD" model number refers to a particular type of Frigidaire dishwasher. This number tells parts suppliers and technicians the general specifications of your appliance. It helps them find the correct manuals and diagrams.

The serial number is unique to your specific appliance. No two Frigidaire dishwashers have the same serial number, even if they are the same model. The serial number helps Frigidaire track manufacturing dates, warranty information, and specific production batches. If there is a recall, the serial number helps identify affected units.

Always write down both numbers. When speaking with customer service or a repair technician, they will ask for both. Providing both ensures they have all the necessary information to assist you accurately. The format of these numbers can vary, but they are usually clearly labeled on the sticker. They often appear with "MODEL NO." and "SERIAL NO." next to them. This distinction is also important if you own other appliances like a [Maytag dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how to find maytag dishwasher model number).

### Alternative Ways to Find Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Information

Sometimes, the sticker with the model and serial number is missing, faded, or damaged. Do not worry if this happens. There are still other ways to find the information you need. These methods rely on documentation or digital records.

**1. Owner's Manual:** Your dishwasher's owner's manual is a valuable resource. The model and serial number are almost always printed on the cover or inside the first few pages. If you kept your manual, this is an easy way to retrieve the details. If you lost the paper manual, you might find a digital version on the Frigidaire website using general product categories.

**2. Purchase Receipt or Invoice:** When you bought your Frigidaire dishwasher, the model number was likely listed on the sales receipt or invoice. Check your email for digital receipts or your physical files. This document also shows the purchase date, which is important for warranty checks.

**3. Online Product Registration:** Many people register their appliances online after purchase. If you registered your Frigidaire dishwasher, you can often log into your account on the Frigidaire website. Your registered products and their details should be listed there. This is a quick digital lookup.

**4. Credit Card or Bank Statement:** If you cannot find the receipt, your bank or credit card statement might show the retailer and date of purchase. You can then contact the retailer with this information. They might be able to look up your purchase details, including the model number.

**5. Original Packaging:** If you still have the box your dishwasher came in, the model and serial number are usually printed on it. This is less likely, but possible for recently purchased units.

These alternative methods ensure you can find your Frigidaire dishwasher's model number even if the physical tag is gone. I always recommend keeping purchase records in a safe place.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What does "P/N" or "Prod. No." mean on the Frigidaire tag?**
A: "P/N" or "Prod. No." stands for "Part Number" or "Product Number." This is often another way to refer to the model number. It helps Frigidaire identify the specific product version. Always use this number when ordering parts or seeking technical support for your appliance.

**Q2: Can I find the model number online without looking at the dishwasher?**
A: Yes, possibly. If you registered your Frigidaire dishwasher online, you can log into your account on the Frigidaire website to find the details. Also, if you have the original purchase receipt, it will list the model number. Otherwise, you must check the physical appliance.

**Q3: Is the serial number the same as the model number?**
A: No, the serial number and model number are different. The model number identifies the product line or type of dishwasher. The serial number is unique to your specific appliance. Each dishwasher has its own distinct serial number. Both are important for service.

**Q4: What if the sticker is completely unreadable or missing?**
A: If the sticker is unreadable or missing, check your owner's manual, original purchase receipt, or any online product registration you may have completed. These documents usually contain the model number. As a last resort, contacting Frigidaire customer support with your purchase date might help them identify your model.

**Q5: Why is the model number so important for appliance repair?**
A: The model number is crucial for repair because it tells technicians exactly what components and specifications your dishwasher has. Parts are model-specific. Without the correct model number, a technician might order the wrong parts or provide incorrect troubleshooting advice. This leads to delays and added costs.
