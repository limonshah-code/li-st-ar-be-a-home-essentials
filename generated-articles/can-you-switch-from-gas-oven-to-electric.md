Gas is highly flammable and dangerous. Even a small leak can cause serious problems. Therefore, this step needs a licensed professional.

A qualified gas plumber or HVAC technician handles gas line work. They have the tools and expertise to shut off the gas supply safely. They will then disconnect the existing gas line from your old oven. After disconnection, they cap the line. Capping means sealing the end of the gas pipe securely. This prevents any gas from escaping into your home. The plumber will perform a leak test to ensure the cap is tight. This step is non-negotiable for safety. Attempting this yourself is extremely risky. It can lead to gas leaks, explosions, or carbon monoxide poisoning.

In many areas, permits are required for gas line alterations. Your plumber will know the local codes and regulations. They will ensure all work complies with these rules. This guarantees the work is done safely and legally. Gas ovens rely on this fuel, and issues can arise if not handled properly. For example, you might experience issues like [why does my gas oven turn off by itself](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-gas-oven-turn-off-by-itself) if there's a problem with the gas flow or safety mechanism. After the gas line is capped, it becomes inactive. You can then proceed with your electric oven installation.
