### Takeaway

*   Choose a thick steak cut for best results.
*   Pat your steak completely dry before seasoning.
*   Preheat your cast iron skillet until it is very hot.
*   Use a high smoke point oil for searing.
*   Flip the steak only once or twice for a strong crust.
*   Always use a meat thermometer for accurate doneness.
*   Rest your steak thoroughly after cooking to keep juices inside.

To cook steak in a cast iron skillet medium rare, you must use high heat to create a crust. Then, cook until the internal temperature reaches 130-135°F. Rest the steak for 5-10 minutes. This method ensures a juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked result every time.

## Selecting Your Steak for Cast Iron Perfection

Picking the right steak is the first step. It truly impacts your final dish. For a medium rare steak in a cast iron skillet, thickness matters most. Choose cuts that are at least 1 to 1.5 inches thick. This allows the outside to sear properly before the inside overcooks.

Popular choices include ribeye, New York strip, and sirloin. Ribeye offers great marbling. Marbling means fat woven through the meat. This fat melts during cooking. It adds incredible flavor and juiciness. New York strip has a good balance of tenderness and flavor. Sirloin is a leaner option. It still cooks well if prepared correctly. Always look for bright red meat. The fat should be creamy white. Avoid meat that looks dull or has grey spots.

High-quality steak improves your cooking success. You want a piece of meat that feels firm. It should have consistent thickness. This helps it cook evenly. Investing in a good steak pays off with a delicious meal.

## Preparing Your Steak for Optimal Cast Iron Searing

Proper preparation ensures a perfect crust. It also helps achieve even cooking. Many people overlook these steps. But they are vital for how to cook steak in a cast iron skillet medium rare. First, take your steak out of the refrigerator. Let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For thicker cuts, let it sit for up to an hour. A cold steak hitting a hot pan cooks unevenly. The outside burns before the inside warms.

Next, pat the steak very, very dry. Use paper towels for this. Moisture on the steak's surface prevents a good sear. Water on the surface boils away first. This steams the meat instead of searing it. A dry surface allows the Maillard reaction to occur. This reaction creates the delicious brown crust. This crust is full of flavor.

Finally, season your steak generously. Use coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. Some chefs use only these two. Others add garlic powder or onion powder. Do not be shy with the salt. A good amount of salt helps draw out some moisture. This aids in searing. Apply it just before you cook. This prevents the salt from drawing out too much moisture prematurely.

## Mastering the Heat: Preheating Your Cast Iron Skillet

Heating your cast iron skillet correctly is crucial. This step creates the famous cast iron sear. A well-preheated pan delivers a consistent, even crust. Place your cast iron skillet on a burner. Set the heat to medium-high or high. Wait patiently for the skillet to heat up. This takes longer than with other pans.

You know the skillet is hot enough when you see a faint wisp of smoke. You can also drop a small bead of water into the pan. It should sizzle and evaporate instantly. Add a high smoke point oil to the hot skillet. Examples include grapeseed oil, avocado oil, or refined sunflower oil. Use just enough to coat the bottom lightly. Swirl the oil around. It should shimmer. Do not let it smoke excessively.

Proper preheating ensures the steak does not stick. It also helps form that perfect crust quickly. Remember, cast iron retains heat exceptionally well. So, adjust your stove setting once the pan is hot.

This ensures optimal performance without damaging your range.

## The Searing Process: Achieving the Perfect Crust

Now for the exciting part: searing your steak. This is where the magic happens. Carefully place your dry, seasoned steak into the hot, oiled cast iron skillet. It should sizzle loudly on contact. Do not move the steak for the first few minutes. Let it sit and develop that beautiful brown crust. This initial sear usually takes 2-3 minutes per side.

Use tongs to lift one edge of the steak. Check for a deep golden-brown crust. Once it forms, flip the steak to the other side. Repeat the searing process. If your steak is thick, you can sear the edges too. Hold the steak with tongs. Sear each side for about 30-60 seconds. This creates an all-around crust.

For added flavor, you can add butter, garlic, and fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme to the pan. Do this during the last minute or two of cooking. The butter will melt and brown. Tilt the pan slightly. Use a spoon to baste the melted butter and herb mixture over the steak. This infuses the steak with incredible aromas and flavor. This basting step also helps create an even crust.

## Achieving Medium Rare: Temperature and Timing

The key to a perfect medium rare steak lies in its internal temperature. Visual cues alone are not reliable. A meat thermometer is your best friend here. For medium rare, you are aiming for an internal temperature between 130°F and 135°F. Start checking the temperature after about 4-5 minutes of total searing for a 1-inch thick steak. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the steak. Make sure it does not touch bone or the pan.

Remember that steak continues to cook after you remove it from the heat. This is called carryover cooking. It can raise the internal temperature by 5-10 degrees. So, pull your steak off the heat a few degrees below your target. For example, if you want 130°F, remove it at 125-128°F. Thicker steaks have more carryover cooking.

The exact cooking time varies. It depends on steak thickness, starting temperature, and stove heat. Generally, a 1-inch thick steak might take 3-5 minutes per side for medium rare. A 1.5-inch thick steak might need 5-7 minutes per side. Always trust your thermometer. It ensures a consistently juicy, rosy-pink interior every time you cook steak in a cast iron skillet medium rare.

## Post-Cook Care: Resting Your Steak and Skillet Cleanup

Resting your steak is just as important as cooking it. Many people skip this step. Do not make this mistake. After removing your steak from the cast iron skillet, place it on a cutting board. Tent it loosely with foil. Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. For thicker cuts, rest up to 15 minutes. During cooking, the meat fibers contract. This pushes juices to the center. Resting allows these juices to redistribute throughout the steak. If you cut it too early, all the delicious juices will run out onto your board. You will end up with a drier steak.

While your steak rests, consider the skillet. Cleaning your cast iron skillet immediately after use is best. Let it cool down slightly. It should still be warm to the touch. This makes cleaning easier. Use hot water and a stiff brush or scraper. Avoid harsh soaps. They can strip away the seasoning. For detailed steps on post-meal cleaning, read our guide on [how to clean cast iron skillet after use](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-cast-iron-skillet-after-use). Proper cleaning ensures your skillet lasts a lifetime.

If you encounter stubborn food bits, you might need a little more effort. Sometimes, food can stick firmly. Or maybe the pan starts to look dull or rusty. Learning general care for your cast iron is key. You can find comprehensive advice on [how to clean cast iron skillet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-cast-iron-skillet) and also understand [how should cast iron skillet look](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-should-cast-iron-skillet-look) for optimal performance. Seasoning it properly after cleaning keeps it non-stick and ready for your next steak.

## Troubleshooting Common Steak Cooking Mistakes

Cooking steak can sometimes go wrong. But most common mistakes are easy to fix. Understanding them helps you cook steak in a cast iron skillet medium rare perfectly. One common issue is uneven cooking. This happens if the steak is too cold when it hits the pan. It also occurs if the steak is not of uniform thickness. Make sure your steak is at room temperature. Use cuts that are evenly thick. If parts are thinner, you can fold them slightly.

Another problem is not getting a good sear. This often comes from a pan that is not hot enough. Or, you might not have patted the steak dry enough. Ensure your skillet is smoking hot before adding the steak. Always pat your steak until completely dry. If your steak sticks to the pan, the pan might not be hot enough, or it lacks proper seasoning. Sometimes, burnt food residue causes sticking. If you have trouble with burnt-on food, consult our guide on [how to clean burnt cast iron](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-burnt-cast-iron).

Overcooking is perhaps the most frustrating mistake. This usually happens from guessing doneness. Always use a reliable meat thermometer. Pull the steak off the heat a few degrees before your target temperature. This accounts for carryover cooking. Lastly, forgetting to rest the steak ruins its juiciness. Always allow sufficient resting time. A little patience ensures a tender and delicious steak every time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to cook steak medium rare in cast iron?
Cooking time varies. For a 1-inch thick steak, it typically takes 2-3 minutes per side for searing. Then, cook for an additional 1-2 minutes per side on lower heat until the internal temperature reaches 130-135°F. Thicker steaks will take longer. Always rely on a meat thermometer for accuracy, not just time.

### What is the ideal internal temperature for medium rare steak?
The ideal internal temperature for a medium rare steak is between 130°F and 135°F. Remember that the steak will continue to cook slightly after removal from heat. It might rise by 5-10 degrees. So, pull it off the heat when it hits 125-128°F. This ensures perfect doneness after resting.

### Should I add butter to steak in cast iron skillet?
Yes, adding butter to your steak in the cast iron skillet is highly recommended. Add it during the last 1-2 minutes of cooking. Use 1-2 tablespoons of unsalted butter along with fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme and garlic cloves. Basting the steak with this mixture adds rich flavor and helps create a beautiful golden crust.

### Why is my cast iron steak sticking to the pan?
Steak sticking often means your cast iron skillet was not hot enough. It could also mean you did not use enough oil. Ensure the pan is preheated until it is very hot and shimmering with oil. A well-seasoned cast iron skillet also helps prevent sticking. Make sure your steak is patted completely dry before cooking too.

### Can I cook a frozen steak in a cast iron skillet?
While you technically can cook a frozen steak in a cast iron skillet, it is not ideal for achieving medium rare doneness. Cooking from frozen makes it hard to get an even cook. The outside will overcook before the inside thaws and reaches the correct temperature. Thawing the steak completely beforehand is always recommended for best results.

### How thick should my steak be for cooking in a cast iron skillet?
For optimal results and to achieve a perfect medium rare, your steak should be at least 1 to 1.5 inches thick. This thickness allows enough time for the outside to develop a deep, flavorful crust without overcooking the interior. Thinner steaks cook too quickly, making medium rare difficult to achieve.
