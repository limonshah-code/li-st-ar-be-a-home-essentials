### Why Won't My LG Dryer Heat?

Your LG dryer does not heat up because of a problem with its electrical supply, a blocked vent system, or a faulty component. Common faulty parts include the thermal fuse, heating element, thermostats, or the igniter in gas models. Fixing these issues often brings back the heat.

## Understanding Common Reasons Your LG Dryer Won't Heat

When your LG dryer does not produce heat, several common issues could be the cause. These problems range from simple fixes to parts that need replacement. Knowing these reasons helps you find the specific problem. It also helps you decide if you can fix it yourself. We will explore the most frequent culprits behind a cold LG dryer.

One main reason for no heat is a lack of proper airflow. Lint builds up over time. This lint can block the dryer vent. A blocked vent causes the dryer to overheat. When the dryer overheats, a safety part, like a thermal fuse, blows. This fuse cuts power to the heating element. It prevents a fire. This issue highlights the importance of regular cleaning.

Electrical issues also play a big role. The dryer needs the correct voltage to heat. A tripped circuit breaker means the dryer does not get enough power. Sometimes, a power cord can have damage. The electrical outlet itself can be faulty. Checking these first saves a lot of time. These checks are simple. They do not require special tools.

Lastly, internal parts can fail. The heating element is a common part to break in electric dryers. It creates the heat. Thermostats control the temperature. If a thermostat fails, the dryer might not heat or might overheat. Gas dryers have different parts like an igniter and flame sensor. If these fail, the gas burner will not light. Understanding these parts helps in finding the problem. Each part has a specific job in the heating process.

## Checking Electrical Supply and Circuit Breaker for LG Dryers

No heat in your LG dryer often starts with a power problem. The dryer needs a strong electrical connection to create heat. Many people overlook this basic step. But checking the power supply can quickly solve the issue. It saves you from complex troubleshooting.

First, look at your home's electrical panel. Find the circuit breaker labeled for your dryer. Dryers usually use two circuit breakers linked together. This is a 240-volt circuit. Sometimes, only one breaker trips. This lets the dryer motor run, but it will not heat. If you see a breaker in the "off" or middle position, it has tripped. Push it firmly to the "off" position first. Then, push it back to the "on" position. This resets the circuit. If it trips again, you might have a different electrical issue that needs professional help. A tripped breaker means an overload or a short.

Next, check the power cord and wall outlet. Make sure the dryer plug sits firmly in the outlet. A loose plug can prevent the dryer from getting full power. Visually inspect the power cord for damage. Look for frayed wires or burnt spots. A damaged cord is a safety risk. You should replace it right away if it has damage. Also, ensure the outlet provides the correct voltage. You can use a voltage meter if you have one. Or, you can test another appliance in the same outlet. If other appliances also have issues, the problem is with the outlet or home wiring.

Sometimes, the power issue relates to the dryer itself, not just the outlet. The terminal block where the power cord connects inside the dryer can loosen. Wires can come off the screws. This causes a partial power supply. If you are comfortable, you can remove the dryer's back panel. Check these connections. Make sure they are tight. Always disconnect the dryer from power before touching internal parts. A power problem can make your [LG dryer not turn on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-lg-dryer-turn-on) at all, or it might just affect the heating.

## Addressing Lint Accumulation and Dryer Vent Blockages

Lint buildup is a very common cause for an LG dryer not heating. It is also a major fire hazard. Over time, lint collects in the lint filter and the dryer vent system. This blockage restricts airflow. Good airflow is essential for a dryer to work correctly. Without proper airflow, the dryer cannot get rid of the moist, hot air. This causes it to overheat.

First, always clean your lint filter before every load. Pull the lint filter out. Remove all the lint. Hold it under running water to check for wax buildup from fabric softener. If water pools on the screen, scrub it with a brush and warm, soapy water. Rinse well and let it dry completely. A clean lint filter is the first defense against clogs.

Second, inspect the dryer vent hose. This hose connects the dryer to the outside vent. Lint often gathers in the flexible part of this hose. Disconnect the hose from the dryer and the wall. Use a vacuum cleaner to remove any lint inside. Look for kinks or crushes in the hose. A crushed hose also restricts airflow. Replace any damaged or excessively long hoses. Shorter, rigid metal ducts are better than long, flexible ones. They prevent lint buildup and improve efficiency.

Third, clean the outside dryer vent. Go outside your house. Locate the dryer vent cover. Lint can build up inside this cover and block the flap. Clean any visible lint from the opening. Some vent covers have screens. These screens can also get clogged. Make sure the flap opens freely when the dryer runs. A clogged vent system can cause the dryer's thermal fuse to blow. This happens because the dryer gets too hot. A blown thermal fuse stops the heating element from working. Regular cleaning of your LG dryer, including the vent, prevents many problems.

## Inspecting and Replacing the LG Dryer Thermal Fuse

The thermal fuse is a safety device in your LG dryer. It is a small, inexpensive part. Its job is to protect the dryer from overheating. If the dryer gets too hot, the thermal fuse blows. When it blows, it cuts power to the heating element. This stops the dryer from producing heat. It is a one-time fuse. Once it blows, you must replace it. You cannot reset it.

A common reason for a thermal fuse to blow is a restricted airflow. This goes back to clogged lint filters or blocked dryer vents. Always clear any airflow issues before replacing the fuse. Otherwise, the new fuse will likely blow again quickly. This is crucial for fixing the underlying problem. It also ensures safe dryer operation.

To inspect the thermal fuse, you need to access it. On most LG dryers, the thermal fuse is near the blower wheel or the heating element housing. It is a small white component. It has two wires connected to it. You will need to remove the back panel of the dryer to find it. Make sure the dryer is unplugged before you start. Use a multimeter set to measure continuity. Place the probes on each terminal of the fuse. A good fuse shows continuity, meaning the circuit is complete. If the multimeter shows no continuity, the fuse is blown.

Replacing the thermal fuse is simple once you have access. Disconnect the old fuse's wires. Unscrew it from its mount. Install the new thermal fuse in the same location. Connect the wires exactly as they were on the old fuse. Make sure connections are secure. Then, put the dryer back together. Remember, replacing the fuse only solves the symptom. You must find and fix why the dryer overheated in the first place.

## Diagnosing and Repairing the LG Dryer Heating Element

The heating element is a critical component in electric LG dryers. It is the part that generates the heat. Over time, the heating coil can break or burn out. When this happens, your dryer will run, but it will not produce any heat. This is a very common issue for electric dryers. Identifying a faulty heating element helps you restore your dryer's function.

To check the heating element, you need to access it. On many LG electric dryers, you can find the heating element assembly by removing the back panel. The heating element is a metal coil housed within a metal chamber. Visually inspect the coils. Look for any visible breaks, scorch marks, or signs of damage. Sometimes, the break is small and hard to see. A multimeter gives a definite answer.

Unplug the dryer from the power source before you touch any internal parts. Disconnect the wires leading to the heating element. Set your multimeter to the Rx1 setting or ohms. Touch one probe to each terminal of the heating element. A working heating element should show a reading between 7.6 to 10.8 ohms. If the multimeter shows infinite resistance or no continuity, the heating element has failed. It needs a replacement. This test works for electric dryers. Gas dryers use a different heating system. If your dryer is electric and [won't heat up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-electric-dryer-heat-up), the heating element is a prime suspect.

Replacing a heating element involves a few steps. You may need to remove the entire heating element housing. Be careful with wiring. Make sure to connect the new element exactly as the old one was. Secure all screws and connections. This repair is common enough that many DIYers can do it. However, if you feel unsure, a professional appliance technician can help. Proper installation ensures safe and effective heating.

## Troubleshooting LG Dryer Thermostats and Sensors

LG dryers use several thermostats and sensors to control temperature. These components ensure the dryer maintains the correct heat level. They also prevent overheating. If one of these parts fails, your dryer might not heat up at all. Or, it might heat unevenly. Identifying which thermostat or sensor is bad is key to a proper repair.

Most LG electric dryers have at least two main thermostats: a cycling thermostat and a high-limit thermostat. The cycling thermostat controls the operating temperature inside the drum. It cycles the heat on and off to maintain the selected temperature setting. The high-limit thermostat is a safety device. It monitors the temperature inside the heater housing. If the temperature exceeds a safe limit, this thermostat trips. It cuts power to the heating element. This prevents fire. A blown thermal fuse usually goes hand-in-hand with an overheating issue caused by a failing high-limit thermostat or restricted airflow.

To test these thermostats, you must access them. They are typically found near the heating element or blower housing. Each thermostat has two wires connected to it. Use a multimeter set to continuity mode. Disconnect the wires from the thermostat. Touch one probe to each terminal of the thermostat. A good thermostat will show continuity at room temperature. If there is no continuity, the thermostat is bad. You need to replace it. Always ensure the dryer is unplugged before testing.

LG dryers also use a thermistor or temperature sensor. This sensor sends temperature readings to the control board. If the thermistor gives inaccurate readings, the control board might not turn on the heating element. You can test a thermistor for resistance using a multimeter. The resistance value changes with temperature. Check your dryer's service manual for the correct resistance values at specific temperatures. If the thermistor readings are off, replacing it can restore heating. Faulty thermostats or sensors are common reasons your dryer lacks heat.

## Examining Gas Dryer Components: Igniter and Flame Sensor (for Gas LG Models)

Gas LG dryers operate differently from electric models. Instead of a heating element, they use natural gas or propane to produce heat. Two key components are essential for a gas dryer to heat: the igniter and the flame sensor. If either of these parts fails, your gas dryer will not produce heat. The dryer may still tumble, but clothes remain cold.

The igniter is a small, fragile ceramic part. It heats up to glow orange, igniting the gas. When the dryer starts a heat cycle, the igniter receives electricity. It gets hot enough to light the gas flowing from the gas valve. If the igniter is cracked, broken, or simply not getting hot enough, the gas will not ignite. You will not hear the "whoosh" sound of the gas burner lighting.

To check the igniter, you need to access the burner assembly. This often involves removing the front panel or the lower access panel of the dryer. With the dryer unplugged, carefully inspect the igniter for visible damage. Look for cracks or breaks in the ceramic. You can also test its resistance with a multimeter. A working igniter usually shows a resistance value within a specific range, often between 60 to 400 ohms. No reading or an infinite reading means the igniter is bad.

The flame sensor, also called a radiant sensor, works with the igniter. It detects if the gas has ignited. Once the igniter lights the gas, the flame sensor sends a signal to the gas valve. This signal tells the valve to stay open. If the flame sensor does not detect a flame, it signals the gas valve to close. This cuts off the gas supply for safety. If the flame sensor is faulty, it may not sense the flame even if the igniter works. This causes the gas valve to close. The dryer will then not heat. You can test the flame sensor for continuity with a multimeter. It should show continuity when cool. If it does not, replace it. These gas-specific components are vital for heat production in gas models.

## Blower Wheel and Airflow Issues Affecting LG Dryer Heat

Even if the heating element or igniter works, your LG dryer still needs proper airflow to heat effectively. The blower wheel is a fan that pulls air through the dryer. It then pushes the hot, moist air out through the vent system. If the blower wheel has issues, airflow becomes restricted. This causes the dryer to overheat or not heat at all.

A common problem is a clogged blower wheel. Lint can build up on the fan blades. This buildup reduces the blower wheel's efficiency. It can also cause the wheel to spin slower. Less air moves through the dryer. The heating element might turn on, but the hot air does not circulate well. This leads to longer drying times and no heat or insufficient heat. A blockage in the blower housing also causes similar issues. Objects like small socks or coins can get past the lint filter and block the blower wheel.

To inspect the blower wheel, you usually need to remove the back panel or sometimes the front of the dryer. Once you access the blower housing, carefully check the fan blades. Remove any lint or debris you find. Ensure the wheel spins freely without wobble. Sometimes, the blower wheel becomes loose on its motor shaft. This causes it to slip or not spin effectively. If it wobbles or feels loose, tighten the set screw that holds it to the motor shaft.

Poor airflow also causes the thermal fuse to blow. The dryer's safety features activate when air cannot escape. This stops the heating cycle. So, if your thermal fuse keeps blowing after replacement, check the blower wheel and the entire vent path. A clean blower wheel ensures hot air moves correctly. This helps your dryer heat efficiently. Good airflow is as important as a working heating element for your LG dryer.
