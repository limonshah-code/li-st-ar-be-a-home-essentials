### Understanding Battery Terminal Rust and Its Causes

Rust on battery terminals is a common sight. It often appears as a white, blue, or green powdery substance. This buildup is not true rust in the iron sense. It is battery corrosion. This corrosion forms when battery acid reacts with the metal terminals. Small amounts of hydrogen gas release from the battery during normal operation. This gas combines with moisture and salts in the air. This reaction creates the corrosive buildup you see.

Several factors contribute to this corrosion. Overcharging your battery can cause excessive gas release. This speeds up the corrosion process. Loose or damaged battery cables also increase the risk. These gaps allow more air and moisture to reach the terminals. A cracked battery case lets acid leak out directly. This causes significant corrosion. Old batteries are more prone to this problem. Their seals and internal components degrade over time. Understanding these causes helps you address the root issue. It also helps you perform targeted maintenance.

Ignoring this corrosion leads to big problems. It creates resistance in the electrical circuit. This resistance makes it harder for your battery to deliver power.
