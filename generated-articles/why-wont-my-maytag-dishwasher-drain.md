**Why won't my Maytag dishwasher drain?** Your Maytag dishwasher likely isn't draining due to a clog in the filter, drain hose, or air gap. A faulty drain pump, an issue with the garbage disposal connection, or a malfunctioning float switch or check valve can also prevent proper water removal.

### Common Causes of Maytag Dishwasher Drainage Issues

When your Maytag dishwasher leaves standing water inside, it often points to a few common culprits. Understanding these causes helps you find the right solution. These problems usually involve obstructions or mechanical failures. Knowing where to look saves you time and effort.

#### Clogged Filters and Sumps

The most frequent reason a **Maytag dishwasher won't drain** is a clogged filter. Over time, food particles, grease, and other debris accumulate in the filter and sump area at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. This build-up creates a barrier that prevents water from flowing into the drain pump. It is surprising how much debris can gather here.

You can often see the standing water in the bottom of your Maytag dishwasher. This is a clear sign that water is not reaching the drain system. Regularly cleaning this area is crucial for proper operation. Ignoring a clogged filter reduces cleaning efficiency and causes drainage problems. For detailed instructions on cleaning, you can refer to [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain).

#### Kinked or Blocked Drain Hoses

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. If this hose gets kinked, twisted, or blocked, water cannot exit the appliance. A common issue is the hose becoming pinched during installation or when moving the dishwasher. This blockage acts like a dam, stopping water flow.

Inside the hose, debris can also build up, narrowing the passage. This makes it harder for water to drain effectively. Check the entire length of the hose for visible damage or twists. Make sure it has a proper high loop to prevent backflow. [Installing a Maytag dishwasher drain hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-maytag-dishwasher-drain-hose) correctly is important.

#### Air Gap or Garbage Disposal Issues

If your dishwasher connects to an air gap on your sink or directly to a garbage disposal, these components can also cause drainage problems. An air gap prevents dirty drain water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If the air gap gets clogged with food particles, water cannot pass through it to the main drain. The water will then back up into the dishwasher tub.

Similarly, if your garbage disposal is clogged or if the knockout plug was not removed during installation, your dishwasher will not drain. The disposal acts as a critical connection point for the drain hose. If water cannot enter the disposal, it has nowhere else to go. Always check these connections first.

### Troubleshooting the Drain Pump and Motor

When your Maytag dishwasher struggles to drain, and simple clogs are not the issue, the problem often lies with the drain pump. The drain pump is a vital component. It uses a motor to force water out of the dishwasher and into the drain line. If this pump malfunctions, water cannot be expelled from the appliance.

#### Checking for Obstructions in the Pump Impeller

Even if the filter is clear, debris might bypass it and reach the drain pump's impeller. Small pieces of glass, food particles, or even a twist tie can get lodged in the impeller blades. This obstruction prevents the impeller from spinning freely. The pump might hum, but it will not move water effectively.

To check for obstructions, you must access the pump, which is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher. Before doing this, always turn off the power to your dishwasher at the circuit breaker. Carefully remove any standing water. Then, follow your appliance manual to access the pump area and inspect the impeller for foreign objects.

#### Testing the Drain Pump Motor

If the impeller is clear, the drain pump motor itself might be failing. A faulty motor can prevent the pump from operating at all, or it might make a loud grinding noise. You can sometimes test the motor for continuity with a multimeter if you are comfortable with electrical tests. No continuity means the motor is bad.

A failing motor requires replacement. This can be a more involved repair. You might hear the motor try to run but fail to move water. This suggests a motor that lacks enough power to drive the impeller.

### Inspecting and Clearing Dishwasher Filters

Regular maintenance is key to preventing drainage problems in your Maytag dishwasher. The filter system catches food particles and prevents them from reaching the drain pump. Over time, these particles accumulate, forming a thick sludge that blocks water flow. Cleaning the filter is a straightforward process and often solves the problem.

Most Maytag dishwashers have a removable cylindrical filter and a coarse filter screen at the bottom of the tub. You should remove both of these components for cleaning. Be sure to consult your owner's manual for specific instructions on how to access your model's filters. The process typically involves twisting and lifting.

Once removed, rinse the filters under hot running water. Use a soft brush or sponge to scrub away any stuck-on food or grease. You can also use a mild dish soap for stubborn residue. Make sure to clean the filter housing inside the dishwasher as well, as debris can collect around it.

After cleaning, carefully reinsert the filters. Ensure they are seated correctly and securely. A loose filter can allow debris to bypass it, leading to future clogs. Making this a monthly routine helps your Maytag dishwasher drain properly and run efficiently. Regular cleaning helps keep your dishes sparkling clean too.

### Addressing Drain Hose and Air Gap Problems

The drain hose is the pathway for water to exit your dishwasher. Problems with this hose or the connected air gap are common reasons why your Maytag dishwasher might not drain. These issues can be simple to fix, but they require careful inspection. Do not overlook these components during your troubleshooting process.

#### Clearing the Drain Hose

First, check the entire length of the drain hose for visible kinks or bends. The hose usually runs from the dishwasher, under the sink, and connects to the garbage disposal or a dedicated drain. Straighten any kinks you find. If the hose is severely bent or damaged, it might need replacement.

Next, you need to check for internal blockages. Disconnect the drain hose from both ends. You can often clear blockages by forcing water through the hose with a garden hose or by using a long brush designed for cleaning pipes. For stubborn clogs, a plumber's snake might be necessary. Always wear gloves during this process.

Remember to place a bucket under the hose when disconnecting it. This will catch any remaining water. After clearing, reattach the hose securely. Ensure the hose has a high loop. This loop prevents dirty water from the sink or disposal from flowing back into your dishwasher.

#### Solving Air Gap Clogs

If your dishwasher uses an air gap, it will be a small cylindrical fitting on your sink or countertop. These units can get clogged with food debris. To check, remove the air gap cover and the cap underneath. Use a paper towel or a small brush to clean out any visible gunk.

Sometimes, the hoses connected to the air gap also get clogged. Disconnect these hoses and inspect them for blockages. Clear any debris you find. Once clean, reassemble the air gap components. Run some water through your sink to ensure the air gap drains properly before trying the dishwasher again.

### Checking the Garbage Disposal Connection

If your Maytag dishwasher is connected to your kitchen's garbage disposal, this connection is a frequent source of drainage issues. Many people overlook this simple check. A simple oversight during installation or a clogged disposal can stop your dishwasher from draining. It is a vital step in troubleshooting.

The first thing to confirm is that the knockout plug inside the garbage disposal's dishwasher inlet was removed during installation. If you recently installed the disposal yourself or had a new one put in, this plug might still be in place. This plug is designed to keep the disposal sealed until a dishwasher is connected. If it's still there, water from the dishwasher has nowhere to go.

To check for the knockout plug, you need to disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the garbage disposal. Look inside the disposal's inlet port where the hose connects. If you see a small, round plastic plug, use a screwdriver and hammer to punch it out. Ensure all pieces of the plug fall into the disposal chamber, then run the disposal to grind them up and flush them away.

Beyond the knockout plug, ensure your garbage disposal itself is clear of clogs. Run the disposal with cold water for a minute to clear any food waste. If the disposal is backed up, it will prevent your dishwasher from draining properly. A clear disposal ensures a clear path for dishwasher waste water.

### Diagnosing Electrical and Mechanical Failures

While clogs are common, sometimes the reason your Maytag dishwasher won't drain involves internal electrical or mechanical components. These issues are less frequent but can be more challenging to diagnose and fix. They require a deeper understanding of the dishwasher's inner workings. Always disconnect power before checking internal components.

#### Float Switch Malfunction

The float switch is a safety device located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It detects the water level. When water fills the tub, the float rises, activating a switch that signals the control board to stop filling and start the wash cycle. If the float switch gets stuck in the "full" position, even when empty, the dishwasher might think it has water and won't initiate the drain cycle.

The float switch can become stuck due to debris or simply fail electrically. To check it, manually push the float up and down to ensure it moves freely. Clean any debris around it. If it moves freely but the dishwasher still doesn't drain, the switch itself might be faulty. A multimeter can test its continuity.

#### Drain Valve or Check Valve Issues

Some Maytag dishwashers have a drain valve that opens to allow water into the drain pump. If this valve is stuck closed or malfunctions, water cannot pass to the pump. Similarly, a check valve, often located near the drain pump or in the drain hose, prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If the check valve is stuck closed or clogged, it will obstruct drainage.

You might need to physically inspect these valves for blockages or signs of damage. The check valve is typically a small flap. It allows water to flow in one direction only. If it's stuck closed or filled with debris, water will not drain. Cleaning or replacing these small parts can resolve the issue.

#### Control Board or Timer Problems

The control board is the "brain" of your Maytag dishwasher. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump, telling it when to operate. If the control board or the main timer (in older models) malfunctions, it might not send the correct signal to the drain pump, causing it to fail to activate. This is often an intermittent issue.

Diagnosing a faulty control board is difficult for the average homeowner. There are usually no visible signs of damage. If you have checked all other possibilities and the dishwasher still won't drain, a failing control board could be the culprit. At this point, I often advise calling a qualified appliance technician. They have specialized diagnostic tools and expertise to identify and fix complex electrical issues.

### Preventive Maintenance for a Healthy Dishwasher

Regular maintenance is the best way to keep your Maytag dishwasher running smoothly and prevent drainage problems. Just like any other appliance, a little care goes a long way. By taking proactive steps, you can avoid frustrating stand-still water in your tub. This will save you time and potential repair costs.

First, **scrape plates before loading**. While dishwashers are designed to handle some food particles, large pieces of food can easily clog filters and drains. Scrape off excess food into the trash before placing dishes in the dishwasher. This simple habit significantly reduces the amount of debris entering your appliance. It helps keep the filters clear.

Second, **clean your dishwasher's filter regularly**. I recommend doing this at least once a month, or more often if you use your dishwasher daily. Refer to your Maytag manual for specific filter cleaning instructions. Removing and rinsing the filter under hot water will prevent food build-up. This is the most common cause of drainage issues.

Third, **periodically run a cleaning cycle**. You can use a commercial dishwasher cleaner or a simple solution of white vinegar and baking soda. Place a cup of white vinegar on the top rack and run a hot cycle with an empty dishwasher. Follow up with baking soda sprinkled on the bottom for another short cycle. This helps remove grease and mineral deposits. [Cleaning your Maytag dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-my-maytag-dishwasher) regularly helps maintain its health.

Finally, **check your drain hose and air gap periodically**. Ensure the drain hose is not kinked and has a proper high loop. If you have an air gap, inspect it for debris and clean it if necessary. A quick visual check can prevent major clogs. These simple steps ensure a long, efficient life for your Maytag dishwasher.
