## Understanding Glass and Your Cuisinart Air Fryer

The question of using glass in air fryers often comes up. Air fryers, including Cuisinart models, operate by circulating very hot air. This creates a cooking environment similar to a convection oven. Not all types of glass are designed to withstand such rapid and intense heat. Understanding the properties of different glass types is essential for safe use.

Glass can react in various ways when exposed to high temperatures. Regular drinking glasses or decorative glass items are not made for oven use. They can crack or shatter when heated quickly or unevenly. This is known as thermal shock. Tempered glass, however, is a different story.

Tempered glass undergoes a special heating and cooling process. This process makes it much stronger and more resistant to thermal shock than ordinary glass. It is designed to withstand significant temperature changes. This is why tempered glass is often used for bakeware and oven doors. Always look for specific labels on your glass items. These labels indicate if they are oven-safe or heat-resistant. Your Cuisinart air fryer reaches temperatures that require such durable materials.

When considering what to use, think about how air fryers work. The hot air surrounds the food quickly. This means any bakeware must handle fast temperature increases. A standard Cuisinart air fryer can reach up to 450째F (232째C). This is a high heat environment. Using the wrong type of glass can lead to dangerous situations. Always prioritize safety in your kitchen.

## Identifying Safe Glass for High Temperatures

Choosing the right glass bakeware for your Cuisinart air fryer is critical. Not all glass is created equal when it comes to heat.
