2.  **Disconnect from Power Source:**
    *   **For 12V DC power (most common for Everchill):** Locate the 12V circuit breaker or fuse for your refrigerator in your RV's power distribution panel. Flip the breaker to the "OFF" position or remove the fuse. This cuts the main power supply to the unit.
    *   **For 120V AC power (if applicable, for shore power or inverter):** If your Everchill unit can also run on AC power, unplug your RV from shore power or turn off the inverter. Alternatively, locate the specific 120V AC circuit breaker for the refrigerator in your RV's main breaker panel and switch it off.
3.  **Wait for Several Minutes:** Once power is completely disconnected, wait for at least 5 to 10 minutes. This waiting period allows any residual charge in the system's capacitors to dissipate. It also ensures the control board fully resets its memory. I usually use this time to quickly check the surrounding area for obstructions or debris.
4.  **Reconnect Power:**
    *   **For 12V DC power:** Flip the 12V circuit breaker back to the "ON" position or reinsert the fuse.
    *   **For 120V AC power:** Plug your RV back into shore power, turn on the inverter, or flip the 120V AC circuit breaker back to "ON."
5.  **Turn On the Refrigerator:** Go back to your Everchill RV refrigerator. Press the power button to turn the unit back on. The display should light up, and you should hear the compressor start running shortly after. If your refrigerator does not turn on immediately, you might need to consult [how to turn on your RV refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-on-rv-refrigerator).

After these steps, monitor your refrigerator for a few hours. Check if it maintains the desired temperature. If the problem persists, you may need to investigate further.

## Checking Electrical Connections and Fuses for Everchill Units

If a basic power cycle does not resolve your Everchill RV refrigerator issues, the next step involves checking its electrical connections and fuses.

    *   **12V DC Fuse:** Locate your RV's 12V DC power distribution panel, typically near the battery or main control center. Find the fuse labeled for the "Refrigerator" or "Fridge." Inspect the fuse for a broken wire or blackened appearance, which indicates it is blown. Replace any blown fuse with one of the exact same amperage rating. I carry spare fuses specifically for this reason.
    *   **12V DC Circuit Breaker:** Some RVs use resettable 12V circuit breakers instead of fuses. Check if the breaker for the refrigerator has tripped (it will often be in an "OFF" or middle position). Push it firmly to the "ON" position to reset it.
    *   **120V AC Circuit Breaker:** If your Everchill model can run on AC power, check the main 120V AC circuit breaker panel in your RV. Ensure the breaker labeled for the refrigerator is in the "ON" position and has not tripped. Reset it if necessary.
*   **Inspect Wiring Connections at the Refrigerator:**
    *   **Access the Rear Panel:** Carefully access the rear of your Everchill RV refrigerator. This usually involves removing an exterior access panel on the side of your RV. Be careful as the area can be tight.
    *   **Check 12V DC Connections:** Locate the 12V power wires (typically red for positive, black or white for negative) connected to the refrigerator's control board or terminal block. Ensure these connections are tight and free from corrosion. A loose connection can cause intermittent power or complete failure.
    *   **Check Ground Wire:** Verify that the ground wire is securely attached. A poor ground connection can lead to various electrical issues.
    *   **Look for Frayed Wires:** Inspect all visible wiring for any signs of damage, fraying, or chew marks from pests. Damaged wires need professional repair.
    *   **Thermal Fuse Check (if present):** Some refrigerators have a small inline thermal fuse near the heating element or on the control board. If it has blown, it will interrupt the circuit. These require replacement.

After checking and securing all connections and replacing any blown fuses or reset tripped breakers, attempt to [get your RV refrigerator to work](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-rv-refrigerator-to-work) by turning it back on. If the issue persists, the problem might be more specific.
