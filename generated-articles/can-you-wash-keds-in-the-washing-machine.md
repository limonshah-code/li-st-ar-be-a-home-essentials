Yes, you can wash most canvas Keds in a washing machine. It is a good way to clean them. You must follow specific steps to protect your shoes and your washer. Use a gentle cycle and cold water for best results. Always air dry your Keds afterward.

### Why Machine Washing Keds Can Be a Smart Choice

Machine washing Keds offers several benefits. It provides a deep clean that hand washing might miss. This method is also very time-saving. I find it much easier than scrubbing each shoe by hand.

Keds are known for their classic canvas design. This material responds well to machine cleaning. The fabric can withstand the agitation of a gentle wash cycle. This helps remove dirt, grime, and even some light stains.

Canvas Keds often absorb sweat and odors over time. A washing machine cleans the entire shoe thoroughly. This helps eliminate unpleasant smells. Your Keds will feel and smell fresh again.

Using a machine helps ensure a consistent clean. Both shoes get the same treatment. This reduces the chance of uneven cleaning. It makes the pair look uniform. For specific machine types, learning [can you wash shoes in LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-lg-washing-machine) or [can you wash shoes in Bosch washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-bosch-washing-machine) can be helpful. Different machines might have specific cycles for shoes.

It is important to follow the correct steps. Preparing your Keds properly protects them from damage. It also keeps your washing machine safe. I always make sure to prepare my Keds carefully before starting a cycle. This simple act saves future problems.

Remember, this method works best for canvas Keds. Other materials need different care. Always check your shoe's material first. This ensures a safe and effective clean every time.

### Essential Preparation Before Washing Your Keds

Proper preparation is important for successful machine washing. It protects your Keds from damage. It also helps your washing machine work correctly. I never skip these first steps.

First, remove the laces from your Keds. Laces can tangle during the wash cycle. They can also get caught in the machine's agitator. Washing them separately allows for a better clean anyway. You can hand wash laces or put them in a small mesh bag.

Next, take out the insoles if they are removable. Some Keds have glued-in insoles, so do not force them. If you can remove them, clean them separately. This helps prevent them from getting waterlogged. It also allows the inside of the shoe to dry better.

After that, brush off any loose dirt or debris. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush. Scrape off mud or caked-on dirt from the soles. This prevents dirt from clogging your washing machine. It also helps the detergent work better on the fabric.

Pre-treat any visible stains on your Keds. Apply a small amount of mild stain remover. You can also use a mixture of mild detergent and water. Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes. Gently rub the stain with a soft brush. This step is crucial for removing stubborn marks.

Place your Keds in a mesh laundry bag. This bag protects the shoes during the wash cycle. It keeps them from banging around inside the drum. It also stops small parts, like eyelets, from scratching the machine. I always use a separate bag for each pair. This helps keep things organized and safe. This preparation helps achieve a clean outcome. This also prolongs the life of both your shoes and your washer.

### Choosing the Right Detergent for Clean Keds

Selecting the proper detergent is crucial when washing Keds. The right choice protects the fabric and color. It also ensures effective cleaning without harsh chemicals. I always use gentle options for my shoes.

Opt for a mild liquid laundry detergent. Powder detergents can sometimes leave residue on the fabric. Liquid detergents dissolve more easily in cold water. This helps prevent streaks or undissolved soap spots on your Keds. Look for detergents labeled "gentle" or "for delicates."

Avoid detergents with harsh chemicals or bleach. Bleach can damage the canvas material. It can also cause discoloration, especially on colored Keds. Harsh chemicals might break down the adhesive holding the shoes together. This can lead to your Keds falling apart.

For extra cleaning power and odor removal, consider adding baking soda. A half-cup of baking soda can be added directly to the wash. It helps neutralize odors naturally. Baking soda also boosts the cleaning action of your detergent. I often use this trick for smelly shoes. For more specific advice on tackling odors, you can explore guides like [how to wash smelly shoes in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-smelly-shoes-in-washing-machine).

White vinegar is another useful addition. Add about half a cup of white vinegar to the fabric softener dispenser. Vinegar acts as a natural deodorizer and brightener. It helps remove soap residue from the shoes. It also kills odor-causing bacteria. I find it leaves my Keds smelling truly fresh.

Do not use too much detergent. Using too much can create excessive suds. This makes it harder for the machine to rinse thoroughly. Excess soap can also leave a film on your Keds. Follow the detergent's recommended amount for a small load. For washing items like a belt, similar care is taken as excess detergent could damage material. You might find some helpful tips about [can you wash a belt in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-a-belt-in-the-washing-machine).

Always ensure the detergent is completely rinsed out. Residual soap can attract more dirt over time. It can also irritate your skin. A proper rinse cycle is key for clean Keds.

### Setting Your Washing Machine for Keds Care

Once your Keds are prepared and you have the right detergent, it is time to set up the washing machine. Proper settings prevent damage to your shoes and the appliance. I follow these steps carefully every time.

First, choose the water temperature. Always use cold water for washing Keds. Hot water can cause several problems. It can shrink the canvas material. Hot water can also cause colors to bleed. This might ruin the look of your shoes. Cold water protects the fabric and the shoe's adhesives.

Next, select the wash cycle. The delicate or gentle cycle is the best choice. These cycles use less agitation. They are designed for items that need careful handling. Avoid heavy-duty or regular cycles. These can be too harsh for Keds. They might cause tears or damage to the shoe's structure.

Consider adding a few old towels to the wash. Place two or three old towels with your Keds. These towels help balance the load in the machine. They also cushion the Keds during the cycle. This prevents the shoes from banging loudly against the drum. The towels also absorb some of the impact. This protects both your Keds and your washing machine.

Set the spin speed to a low setting. A high spin speed can be too forceful. It can warp the shape of your Keds. A low spin helps remove excess water gently. This prepares them for drying without causing stress on the material. Some machines, like a Miele, have specific shoe or delicate settings. Knowing [can I wash shoes in Miele washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-wash-shoes-in-miele-washing-machine) can guide you further.

If your machine has an extra rinse option, use it. This ensures all detergent is thoroughly washed out. Residual soap can lead to stiffness or dullness. An extra rinse gives you cleaner, fresher Keds.

Avoid overloading the washing machine. Washing too many pairs at once can reduce cleaning effectiveness. It can also strain your machine. Stick to one or two pairs of Keds per wash. This allows enough space for proper agitation and rinsing.

### Protecting Your Keds and Washer During the Cycle

Protecting both your Keds and your washing machine during the wash cycle is vital. Small steps here prevent big problems later. I make sure to do these things every time I wash my Keds.

Always place your Keds inside a mesh laundry bag. This is a very important step. The bag acts as a protective barrier. It keeps the shoes contained and prevents them from flopping around. This stops the Keds from hitting the sides of the washing machine drum. Without a bag, constant banging could damage both the shoes and the machine. The bag also prevents laces or other small parts from getting caught. This protects the delicate parts of the shoes.

Add two to three old towels to the washing machine with your Keds. These towels serve multiple purposes. First, they help balance the load. This is especially useful in top-loading machines. An unbalanced load can cause the washer to shake violently. This can lead to wear and tear on the machine. Second, the towels act as cushions. They absorb much of the impact as the shoes tumble. This further protects your Keds from damage. They also protect the machine's inner components. Third, the towels add extra friction. This can help to scrub the Keds more effectively.

Ensure all zippers, snaps, or hooks on the towels are closed. Loose metal parts can scratch the inside of your washing machine. They could also snag on the mesh bag or the Keds themselves. This simple check avoids accidental damage.

Avoid washing your Keds with delicate clothing items. The shoes, even in a bag, can still be heavy. They could potentially damage fragile fabrics. Stick to washing Keds with items like towels or other sturdy garments. If you are washing things like a shower curtain, you would similarly consider the wash load to protect it from damage and to protect the machine, so looking at [can you wash a shower curtain in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-a-shower-curtain-in-the-washing-machine) could give you context.

Do not use a top-loading machine with a central agitator if possible. A front-loading machine or a top-loader without a central agitator is gentler. The agitator in older machines can be rough. It can twist and pull at your Keds, causing damage. If you only have an agitator machine, place the Keds carefully around the agitator, not directly on top of it.

After the cycle finishes, remove your Keds promptly. Do not leave them sitting in the damp machine. This can lead to mildew growth. This can also cause a bad smell. Taking them out quickly helps them stay fresh.

### The Best Way to Dry Keds After Washing

Drying your Keds properly after washing is just as important as the wash itself. Incorrect drying methods can cause shrinkage, damage, or odors. I always follow specific steps to ensure my Keds dry perfectly.

The best way to dry Keds is by air drying. Never put your Keds in a machine dryer. High heat from a dryer can cause the canvas to shrink. It can also melt the rubber soles and adhesives. This can distort the shape of your shoes. It will make them uncomfortable or even unwearable. The heat can also cause yellowing on white Keds.

After removing your Keds from the washing machine, gently reshape them. You can stuff the inside of each shoe with white paper towels or clean, plain newspaper. This helps absorb excess moisture. It also helps maintain the shoe's original shape as it dries. Avoid using colored newspaper, as the ink might transfer to your shoes. Replace the paper as it becomes damp.

Place your Keds in a well-ventilated area. A spot with good airflow is ideal for drying. You can put them outdoors on a sunny, breezy day. Make sure they are not in direct, intense sunlight for too long. Too much direct sun can fade colors or make the rubber brittle. A shaded outdoor spot is often best.

If drying indoors, choose a spot near a window or fan. You can also place them on a drying rack. Ensure there is enough space around each shoe for air to circulate. Do not put them in a damp basement or a closed closet. This can lead to mildew and a musty smell. Bathroom rugs, for example, are also best air-dried for similar reasons to prevent mildew, and you can learn about [how to wash bathroom rugs in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-bathroom-rugs-in-washing-machine).

Allow ample time for your Keds to dry completely. This can take 24 to 48 hours, depending on humidity. It is important that they are fully dry before you wear them. Wearing damp Keds can cause blisters. It also encourages bacterial growth and odor.

Once dry, reinsert the laces and insoles. Your Keds should now look and feel much fresher. Proper drying extends the life of your shoes. It keeps them looking good.

### When Machine Washing Keds Is Not Recommended

While machine washing works for many Keds, some types are not suitable. Knowing when to avoid the washing machine protects your shoes. It also prevents damage to delicate materials. I always check the shoe material first.

Do not machine wash Keds made of leather or suede. These materials react poorly to water and machine agitation. Water can cause leather to stiffen, crack, or lose its shape. Suede can become discolored and matted. For leather and suede Keds, use specific cleaning products. Spot clean them by hand.

Avoid washing Keds with delicate embellishments or intricate designs. This includes shoes with beads, sequins, embroidery, or glitter. The machine cycle can damage or remove these decorations. They might also clog your washing machine. Hand washing is a safer option for such shoes.

Keds with unique dyes or painted designs should also avoid machine washing. Water and detergent can cause these colors to bleed or fade. This can ruin the shoe's aesthetic. Test a small, hidden area first if you are unsure. Or, stick to spot cleaning to preserve the design.

If your Keds have visible damage, avoid machine washing. This includes loose seams, torn fabric, or peeling soles. The washing machine's agitation can worsen these issues. It might cause the shoe to fall apart completely. Repair these Keds by hand first. Then, consider if they are still suitable for a gentle wash.

Very old or worn-out Keds might also not withstand a machine wash. The fabric might be too weak. The adhesive holding the shoe together could be brittle. A machine wash might be the final blow. If your Keds are at the end of their life, a gentle hand wash might be better. Or, consider replacing them.

Check the care label inside your Keds, if available. Some Keds models might specify "spot clean only" or "hand wash." Always follow the manufacturer's instructions. These instructions are there to help you maintain the shoe's quality.

When in doubt, always choose hand washing. Hand washing allows more control. It minimizes the risk of damage. It is safer for shoes that are not clearly canvas or have special features.

### Keeping Your Keds Fresh Between Washes

Maintaining your Keds between washes helps them stay clean longer. It reduces the need for frequent machine washing. This also extends the lifespan of your shoes. I use simple practices to keep my Keds looking good daily.

Brush off loose dirt after each wear. Use a soft brush or a dry cloth. This prevents dirt from embedding into the canvas fabric. It also keeps your shoes from looking grubby. Regular brushing is a quick way to maintain their appearance.

Spot clean small marks immediately. Do not wait for stains to set. Use a damp cloth with a tiny bit of mild soap. Gently rub the affected area. Rinse the soap away with a clean, damp cloth. Quick action prevents minor marks from becoming stubborn stains.

Deodorize your Keds regularly. Shoes can get smelly, especially if you wear them often. Sprinkle baking soda inside your Keds overnight. Baking soda absorbs odors naturally. Pour out the powder in the morning before wearing them. You can also use shoe deodorizer sprays or inserts. This keeps them smelling fresh.

Allow your Keds to air out after wearing them. Do not store them in a closed shoe rack or closet right away. Let them sit in a well-ventilated area for a few hours. This allows any moisture from sweat to evaporate. Proper airflow prevents odor-causing bacteria from growing.

Rotate your Keds with other shoes. Wearing the same pair every day puts more wear and tear on them. It also does not give them time to fully dry out between wears. Having a few pairs of shoes allows each pair to rest. This helps them last longer.

Use shoe trees or stuff them with paper when storing. This helps maintain the shoe's shape. It also prevents creasing. Cedar shoe trees are particularly good. They absorb moisture and naturally deodorize.

Protect your Keds from the elements. Avoid wearing them in heavy rain or mud if possible. If they do get wet, dry them properly as soon as you can. Do not leave them wet and crumpled. This prevents mildew and damage.

Consider using a fabric protector spray. These sprays can add a layer of resistance to water and stains. Apply it according to the product instructions. This extra barrier can help keep your Keds cleaner for longer. These practices save you from frequent machine washing. They keep your Keds in great condition.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: How often can I machine wash my Keds?**

**Q5: What if my Keds turn yellow after washing?**
A5: Yellowing often happens when white canvas is exposed to excessive heat during drying. It can also be from soap residue. Always air dry your Keds completely.

**Q6: Is it safe to use fabric softener on Keds?**
A6: It is generally best to avoid fabric softener when washing Keds. Fabric softener can leave a residue on the canvas material. This residue can make the shoes feel stiff. It can also attract more dirt over time. Plain detergent and an optional half-cup of white vinegar are usually sufficient.
