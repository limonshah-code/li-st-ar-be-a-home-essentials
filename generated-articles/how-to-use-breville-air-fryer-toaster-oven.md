These powerful kitchen appliances combine multiple functions into one sleek design. They offer convenience and versatility for home cooks of all skill levels.

Many people buy these units but do not use them to their full potential. This guide shows you exactly how to operate your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven. We will cover initial setup, detailed function explanations, and helpful cooking tips. You will also learn about essential maintenance to keep your appliance in top condition. Get ready to transform your cooking experience with this remarkable machine.

### Takeaway

*   Unpack and set up your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven carefully.
*   Understand each cooking mode for best results.
*   Use the air fry setting for crispy textures.
*   Clean your appliance regularly for lasting performance.

To use your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven, begin by plugging it in and setting the clock. Select your desired cooking function, such as air fry, bake, or toast, then adjust the temperature and time using the control knobs. Place food inside on the correct rack position, and start cooking.

## Understanding Your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven

The Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven is more than just a simple oven. It is a multi-functional cooking device. It combines the power of an air fryer with the convenience of a toaster oven. This combination makes it a valuable tool for any kitchen.

This appliance typically features several cooking modes. These modes include air fry, bake, roast, broil, toast, and dehydrate. Each mode uses specific heating elements and fan speeds to achieve different cooking results. The intuitive control panel makes selecting these modes easy. You simply turn a knob or press a button.

Breville models often come with a smart element IQ system. This technology directs power to where it is most needed. It ensures precise and even cooking. This means your food cooks perfectly every time. Understanding these core features helps you use the appliance effectively. It truly offers a versatile cooking experience.

Many people wonder if their Breville toaster oven truly acts as an air fryer. Yes, it does. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer models are designed with a powerful convection fan. This fan circulates hot air rapidly. This hot air movement produces the crispy, golden results typical of traditional air fryers. So, you get the best of both worlds in one appliance. This saves counter space and offers great flexibility.

## Getting Started: Initial Setup and First Use

Setting up your new Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven is a straightforward process. First, remove all packaging materials. This includes any tape, cardboard inserts, or protective films. Make sure to check inside the oven cavity for these items. I always do a quick scan to avoid any unexpected burning smells later.

Choose a suitable location for your appliance. It should be on a flat, stable, heat-resistant surface. Allow plenty of space around the oven for ventilation. Avoid placing it directly under cabinets, as heat can build up. Plug the oven into a grounded electrical outlet.

Before cooking food, perform an initial burn-off cycle. This helps to remove any manufacturing residues. Set the oven to 400°F (200°C) on the "Bake" function for about 15 minutes. Some smoke or odor might occur during this first use. This is normal and will dissipate. Once complete, your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven is ready for its first culinary adventure.

After the initial burn-off, open the oven door to air it out. Let it cool down completely. You can then wipe the interior with a damp cloth if needed. This step ensures your first actual meal tastes pure and delicious. Taking these simple steps at the start prepares your oven for many years of good cooking.

## Mastering the Air Fryer Function

The air fry function is a standout feature of your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven. It uses a high-speed fan to circulate very hot air around your food. This creates a crispy, golden-brown exterior. It works like deep frying but uses little to no oil. I love how it makes French fries taste just like a restaurant's.

To use the air fry function, place your food in the air fry basket. Ensure food items are in a single layer. Overcrowding the basket can prevent air circulation. This results in less crispy food. Place the basket onto the wire rack in the suggested air fry position. This position is usually the middle or upper rack.

Select the "Air Fry" mode on your oven's control panel. Adjust the temperature and cooking time based on your recipe. Preheating is often recommended for best air frying results. This helps the oven reach the correct temperature before food goes in. Always check your food midway through cooking. Shake the basket or flip items for even crisping.

Remember that air frying can cook food faster than conventional baking. It often requires lower temperatures too. For example, if a recipe calls for baking at 400°F, you might air fry at 375°F. Adjust cooking times as needed. Experience will help you learn the perfect settings for your favorite foods. You will soon make perfect air-fried chicken wings and vegetables.

## Exploring Other Breville Cooking Functions

Your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven offers more than just air frying. It has multiple cooking modes to handle diverse recipes. Each function uses different heating elements and fan settings. Understanding them helps you get the best results. I often switch between modes depending on what I am cooking.

### Baking and Roasting

The "Bake" function is perfect for cookies, cakes, casseroles, and more. It uses lower heating elements for even heat distribution. Set the temperature and time as you would for a conventional oven. Use the middle rack for most baking. For "Roast," the oven uses higher heat and often a stronger fan. This mode is ideal for meats and vegetables, giving them a tender inside and a browned exterior. It produces wonderful roasted potatoes and chicken.

### Toasting and Bagel

The "Toast" function is for bread slices, English muffins, and waffles. You select the desired number of slices and toast shade. The oven then calculates the time automatically. The "Bagel" setting is specifically designed for bagels. It toasts the cut side while gently warming the crust. This prevents over-browning of the outer surface. These settings make breakfast quick and easy.

### Broiling and Warming

"Broil" uses high heat from the top heating elements. This is great for melting cheese, browning the tops of casseroles, or searing meats. Always watch food closely when broiling, as it cooks very quickly. The "Warm" setting keeps food at a safe, low temperature without cooking it further. This is useful for keeping dishes hot before serving guests. It prevents food from getting cold while other parts of the meal finish cooking.

### Dehydrating and Slow Cooking

Some advanced Breville models include "Dehydrate" and "Slow Cook" functions. Dehydrating uses low, consistent heat over many hours. This removes moisture from fruits, vegetables, or meats for jerky. Slow cooking works similarly to a traditional slow cooker. It uses low temperatures for extended periods to tenderize tough cuts of meat. These functions expand your cooking possibilities even further. You can make your own healthy snacks or tender pot roasts.

## Essential Accessories and Their Use

Your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven comes with several accessories. Each accessory helps you cook different types of food. Using the right accessory for the job improves cooking results. I always check which tray or rack a recipe suggests.

### The Air Fry Basket

The air fry basket is crucial for achieving crispy results. It has a mesh design. This allows hot air to circulate completely around your food. Use it for fries, chicken wings, tater tots, or any food you want to crisp. Place the air fry basket on the wire rack, not directly on the oven floor. This ensures proper airflow.

### The Baking Pan and Roasting Pan

The baking pan is a solid metal tray. It is ideal for cookies, sheet pan dinners, or anything that might drip. The roasting pan is usually deeper and may come with a wire insert. This combo is perfect for roasting meats and vegetables. The wire insert allows fats to drip away. Both pans collect any juices or crumbs, making cleanup easier.

### Pizza Pan and Crumb Tray

Many Breville models include a non-stick pizza pan. This pan is great for making homemade or frozen pizzas. It helps distribute heat evenly for a crispy crust. The crumb tray slides out from the bottom of the oven. It catches crumbs and drips. Empty and clean this tray regularly to prevent burnt odors and maintain hygiene. It is one of the easiest parts to clean.

You might also wonder if you can use foil in your Breville air fryer. Yes, you can generally use aluminum foil in your Breville air fryer toaster oven for certain tasks. It helps with cleanup or to prevent certain areas from over-browning. However, never cover the air fryer basket completely with foil, as this blocks airflow. This airflow is essential for the air frying process. Using foil improperly can also hinder proper cooking. You should always ensure foil does not touch the heating elements. This can create a fire hazard. For specific tips on using foil, you might find more information on resources like [Can I Use Foil in My Breville Air Fryer?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-foil-in-my-breville-air-fryer) or [Can You Put Aluminum Foil in Breville Air Fryer Oven?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-aluminum-foil-in-breville-air-fryer-oven). Always use caution and follow manufacturer recommendations.

## Optimizing Your Breville Cooking Experience

Getting the best out of your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven involves more than just selecting a mode. Small adjustments can make a big difference. I have learned a few tricks over time that really improve my cooking.

### Temperature and Time Adjustments

Many recipes are designed for conventional ovens. Your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven often cooks faster and more efficiently. As a rule of thumb, you might need to reduce the temperature by 25°F (15°C) and reduce cooking time by 10-20%. For example, if a recipe calls for 400°F for 20 minutes, try 375°F for 15-18 minutes first. Always check for doneness. An internal meat thermometer is a great tool.

### Rack Positions Matter

The Breville oven usually has multiple rack positions. The correct rack position is key for optimal results for each function. For air frying, use the middle or upper position for maximum crispness. For baking, the middle rack provides the most even heat. Broiling requires the top rack for intense direct heat. Refer to your user manual or the oven's internal guides for specific recommendations. I often adjust the rack position based on how browned I want my food to get.

### Avoid Overcrowding

This is a common mistake. When air frying or roasting, do not overcrowd the basket or pan. Overcrowding prevents hot air from circulating freely around the food. This leads to steaming instead of crisping. Cook in smaller batches if needed. This ensures every piece gets proper air exposure and cooks evenly. A little patience leads to much better results.

### Preheating for Best Results

While some quick tasks like toast do not need preheating, most cooking functions benefit greatly from it. Preheating allows the oven cavity to reach the set temperature before food enters. This helps food cook more evenly and achieves better textures. For air frying, preheating is almost always recommended to ensure immediate crisping. My food always comes out better when I take the time to preheat.

You can further enhance your cooking knowledge by exploring specific models, such as learning [how to use Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer-pro). Each model may have unique features that enhance your cooking experience.

## Maintaining Your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven

Keeping your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven clean is vital. Regular cleaning ensures it performs well and lasts longer. It also prevents food odors and smoke from accumulating. I clean my oven after every few uses to keep it looking new.

### Daily and Weekly Cleaning

After each use, let the oven cool down. Then, remove the crumb tray and empty it. Wipe down the interior surfaces with a damp cloth and mild dish soap. Do this gently to avoid scratching. For stubborn spots, a non-abrasive sponge can help. For accessories like the air fry basket and baking pan, wash them in warm, soapy water. Most are dishwasher safe, but check your manual first.

For a deeper clean, especially if you notice baked-on grease, specific methods work best. You can create a paste with baking soda and water. Apply it to affected areas. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then wipe clean. This helps break down tough stains. Always avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. They can damage the non-stick coating or stainless steel finish.

### Addressing Spills and Grease

Spills happen. If something boils over or drips, clean it as soon as the oven cools. Fresh spills are much easier to remove. Burnt-on grease becomes harder to clean over time. For persistent grease, specialized oven cleaners designed for air fryers or toaster ovens may be an option. Always follow product instructions carefully. Ensure good ventilation when using chemical cleaners.

### Fan and Heating Elements

Do not attempt to clean the heating elements or the convection fan directly. These parts are delicate and can be damaged. If you notice significant debris on the fan, consult your user manual or contact Breville customer support. Regular general cleaning should prevent most issues around these areas. Consistent care ensures your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven remains a reliable kitchen companion.

These guides provide specific instructions for maintaining your appliance's cleanliness.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even the best appliances can have small hiccups. Knowing how to fix common issues with your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven saves time and frustration. Most problems have simple solutions. I have encountered a few, and usually, a quick check solves them.

### Uneven Cooking

If your food cooks unevenly, several factors could be at play. First, check if you overcrowded the basket or pan. Remember, proper air circulation is key for even cooking. Try cooking in smaller batches. Second, rotate your food halfway through the cooking cycle. This ensures all sides get equal heat exposure. Third, verify your rack position. Using the recommended rack for each function helps distribute heat correctly. Sometimes, simple adjustments make all the difference.

### Appliance Not Turning On

If your Breville oven does not power on, start with the power source. Ensure the appliance is securely plugged into a working outlet. Check your home's circuit breaker to see if it tripped. Sometimes, resetting the oven by unplugging it for a few minutes and plugging it back in can resolve minor electrical glitches. If these steps do not work, contact Breville customer support.

### Excessive Smoke or Odor

A little smoke during the initial burn-off is normal. However, persistent or excessive smoke indicates an issue. This usually means there is food debris or grease buildup inside the oven. Unplug the oven and let it cool completely. Then, perform a thorough cleaning, especially focusing on the crumb tray and interior walls. I always make sure to wipe up drips quickly. If the smoke continues after cleaning, there might be an issue with the heating elements. In this case, professional service might be needed.

### Food Not Getting Crispy Enough

This is a common concern with air fryers. Ensure you are using the air fry basket, not a solid pan. The basket's design allows air to circulate around all sides of the food. Also, make sure you are not overcrowding. Proper preheating is crucial for crispiness. A quick spray of oil on your food before air frying can also enhance crispiness. If you are cooking wet foods, pat them dry before placing them in the oven. This helps achieve that desired crunch.

## Creative Recipes and Usage Ideas

Your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven is a versatile tool for everyday meals and special treats. It goes beyond just making toast. I love experimenting with new recipes in mine.

### Quick and Healthy Meals

Use the air fry function for quick and healthy weeknight dinners. Air fry chicken breasts or fish fillets with a sprinkle of seasoning. Serve them with roasted vegetables. You can air fry broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or asparagus for a delicious side dish. The oven cooks these items quickly, locking in flavor and nutrients. This saves time and effort.

### Snacks and Appetizers

Create crispy snacks like homemade potato chips, sweet potato fries, or kale chips. For appetizers, air fry mozzarella sticks, spring rolls, or chicken tenders. The air fryer function gives these items a restaurant-quality crispness. They are perfect for game nights or casual gatherings. I often make a big batch of wings for my friends.

### Baking and Desserts

Do not forget the baking capabilities. Bake small batches of cookies, brownies, or a personal-sized pizza. The even heat distribution ensures consistent results. For breakfast, make crispy bacon or a frittata. You can also toast nuts or seeds for salads or baking. The oven is surprisingly good at small-scale baking projects.

### Reheating Leftovers

Reheat pizza, fried chicken, or pastries in your Breville air fryer toaster oven. Unlike a microwave, it reheats food to a crispy texture. It tastes fresh again. Set it to a lower temperature, around 300-350°F, on the air fry or bake setting for best results. This prevents drying out. I find leftovers taste much better this way.

## FAQ Section

### How often should I clean my Breville air fryer toaster oven?
Clean the crumb tray and wipe down the interior after every few uses or major spills. Perform a deeper clean, including washing accessories, at least once a week if you use it frequently. Regular cleaning prevents grease buildup and keeps the oven working well.

### Can I use parchment paper in my Breville air fryer?
Yes, you can use parchment paper. However, ensure it is weighted down by food. Loose parchment paper can fly up and touch the heating elements, posing a fire risk. Avoid using it during the air fry function unless it is specifically designed for air fryers with holes.

### What is the best temperature for air frying?
Most air frying recipes suggest temperatures between 350°F and 400°F (175°C to 200°C). The ideal temperature depends on the food type and desired crispiness. Start with recommended recipe temperatures and adjust as you gain experience with your oven.

### Is preheating necessary for all functions?
Preheating is highly recommended for most cooking functions, especially air frying, baking, and roasting. It ensures the oven reaches the correct temperature before food is added. This helps cook food more evenly and achieve better textures. For toast, preheating is not typically needed.

### Can I put frozen food directly into the Breville air fryer?
Yes, you can cook most frozen foods directly in your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven. Adjust cooking time and possibly temperature. Check for specific instructions on the food packaging. Many frozen items like fries, chicken nuggets, and spring rolls cook excellently from frozen.

### What is the difference between air fry and convection bake?
Air fry uses a very high-speed fan to circulate hot air rapidly, creating a crispy exterior like deep frying. Convection bake uses a slower fan speed for more even heat distribution. This is ideal for general baking and roasting where you want uniform cooking rather than extreme crispness.

## Conclusion

Your Breville Air Fryer Toaster Oven is a truly versatile kitchen appliance. It allows you to air fry, bake, roast, toast, and more.
