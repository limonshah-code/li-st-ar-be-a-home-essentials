## Can Weighted Blankets Go In The Washing Machine?

Getting a weighted blanket can be a wonderful experience. These blankets offer comfort and a sense of calm. You might wonder, "Can weighted blankets go in the washing machine?" Keeping your blanket clean is important for hygiene and its lifespan. This guide will answer that question clearly. We will explore how to wash a weighted blanket safely. We will also cover different blanket types and their cleaning needs.

We will discuss machine washing steps and the importance of checking care labels. You will learn about hand washing methods for delicate blankets. We will also cover drying techniques and common mistakes to avoid. Finally, we will share tips for keeping your washing machine in good condition after handling heavy items. My goal is to give you all the information you need to care for your weighted blanket.

### Takeaway

*   Always check the care label on your weighted blanket first. This label gives specific washing instructions.
*   Most weighted blankets with glass beads or plastic pellets can be machine washed if they are under 20 pounds.
*   Use a large capacity washing machine and a gentle cycle with cold water. Avoid harsh detergents and bleach.

### Clear and Concise Answer

Yes, many weighted blankets can go in the washing machine, but it depends on their weight, filling material, and care label. Lighter blankets (under 20 lbs) with glass beads or plastic pellets are generally safe for machine washing on a gentle cycle. Always consult the blanket's care instructions first to avoid damage.

## Understanding Your Weighted Blanket: Fillings and Fabric Types

Before you wash your weighted blanket, it is important to know what it is made of. Weighted blankets are filled with different materials. These materials give the blanket its calming weight. The outer fabric also plays a role in how you should clean it.

Different fillings and fabrics need different cleaning approaches. Knowing your blanket's make-up helps you choose the right washing method. This knowledge prevents damage during the cleaning process. I always check these details before I start.

### Common Weighted Blanket Fillings

Weighted blankets get their weight from various internal fillings. These fillings are usually small, evenly distributed materials. They make the blanket heavy but still comfortable. Each type reacts differently to water and agitation.

*   **Glass Beads:** These are tiny, sand-like beads. They are smooth and dense. Blankets with glass beads are often slim. They usually hold up well to machine washing. Glass beads are a common choice for many brands.
*   **Plastic Pellets:** These are small, rounded plastic pieces. They are a bit larger than glass beads. Blankets with plastic pellets can be machine washed. However, they might make more noise in the machine. These pellets are usually non-toxic and durable.
*   **Sand or Grains:** Some older or DIY blankets might use natural fillers like sand, rice, or beans. These are generally *not* machine washable. They can absorb water, swell, and spoil. Avoid machine washing blankets with these fillings.
*   **Organic Fillers (e.g., Buckwheat Hulls):** Similar to sand or grains, these natural fillers are usually not suitable for machine washing. They can degrade or grow mold when wet. Always check the label for these types.

### Exterior Fabric Materials

The fabric cover of your weighted blanket also matters. It determines how gentle you need to be. Some fabrics are more delicate than others.

*   **Cotton:** Cotton covers are common and durable. They are usually machine washable. Cotton is breathable and easy to care for. It can handle most gentle cycles.
*   **Minky or Fleece:** These fabrics are soft and plush. They are often machine washable. Use cold water and a gentle cycle to keep them soft. High heat can damage the fibers.
*   **Velvet or Microfiber:** These fabrics are also soft and smooth. They can usually be machine washed. Be careful with these materials. They can be prone to static or lint if not washed correctly.
*   **Bamboo:** Bamboo fabric is known for being soft and cooling. It is often machine washable. Use a gentle cycle and cold water to maintain its quality. Avoid harsh chemicals with bamboo.

Knowing both the filling and the fabric helps you make a smart washing decision. Always refer to your blanket's specific care tag. This ensures the best care.

## Essential Pre-Washing Checks and Preparations

Before you put your weighted blanket into the washing machine, some crucial steps are needed. Proper preparation prevents damage to your blanket and your machine. Skipping these checks can lead to costly repairs or a ruined blanket. I always take a few minutes to prepare.

These steps ensure a smoother washing process. They help keep your blanket in good condition. Taking time for these checks is well worth it.

### Reading the Care Label: Your Ultimate Guide

The care label is the most important thing to check. Every weighted blanket should have one. This small tag tells you exactly how to wash and dry your blanket. It is the manufacturer's specific advice. Ignoring it can void warranties or damage the blanket.

*   **Look for Symbols and Text:** The label will have washing symbols or written instructions. It might say "machine wash cold," "do not bleach," or "tumble dry low." Some blankets might say "spot clean only" or "hand wash only."
*   **Note Weight Limits:** Some labels will specify a maximum weight for machine washing. Blankets over a certain weight (often 20 pounds) might be too heavy for standard home machines. This is a key detail to watch for.
*   **Identify Filling Material:** The label often confirms the blanket's filling. This helps you understand how it will react to water. Knowing the filling reinforces the washing instructions.

### Inspecting Your Blanket for Damage

Before washing, check your blanket for any tears or loose seams. A damaged blanket can cause big problems in the wash. Fillings could escape and clog your machine. This could lead to a messy situation.

*   **Check Seams:** Run your hands along all the seams. Look for any loose threads or openings. Weighted blankets have many stitched pockets. Make sure they are all intact.
*   **Look for Tears:** Inspect the fabric for any rips or holes. Even a small tear can expand in the washing machine. This allows the internal beads to escape.
*   **Repair if Needed:** If you find any damage, repair it before washing. A simple stitch can prevent a large mess. This step protects both your blanket and your washing machine.

### Preparing for the Wash

A few quick steps can make the washing process easier. These steps ensure your blanket is ready for a thorough cleaning. They also protect your washing machine.

*   **Remove Duvet Cover:** If your weighted blanket has a removable duvet cover, take it off. Most duvet covers are much easier to wash separately. They are usually lighter and can handle more vigorous washing. Wash the cover according to its own care label.
*   **Spot Treat Stains:** For specific stains, pre-treat them before washing the whole blanket. Use a mild stain remover directly on the spot. Follow the product's instructions. This helps lift tough stains before a full wash.
*   **Consider a Mesh Laundry Bag:** For smaller weighted blankets, using a large mesh laundry bag can offer extra protection. It keeps the blanket contained and prevents tangling. This can also help distribute the weight evenly.

By following these pre-washing checks, you set yourself up for success. You protect your valuable weighted blanket. You also safeguard your washing machine from potential issues.

## Machine Washing Your Weighted Blanket: Step-by-Step Guide

Washing a weighted blanket in a machine needs careful attention. Following the right steps helps clean the blanket without causing damage. It also protects your washing machine. I have learned that a gentle approach works best.

These steps ensure a safe and effective wash. They help keep your blanket soft and heavy for a long time. Pay close attention to each part of the process.

### Choosing the Right Washing Machine

The type and size of your washing machine matter a lot. Weighted blankets can be very heavy when wet. This weight can strain smaller or older machines.

*   **Large Capacity is Best:** Use a large capacity washing machine. A standard home washer might struggle with blankets over 15-20 pounds. Consider using a commercial-grade machine at a laundromat for heavier blankets.
*   **Front-Load vs. Top-Load:** Front-load washing machines are generally better for weighted blankets. They do not have a central agitator. This reduces stress on the blanket and prevents tangling. If you have a top-loader with an agitator, ensure enough space. Place the blanket evenly around the agitator.
*   **Check Weight Limit:** Your washing machine has a weight limit. Exceeding this limit can damage the machine's motor or suspension. Refer to your washing machine manual if unsure.

### Selecting the Right Settings

Using the correct wash settings is crucial for weighted blankets. Wrong settings can damage the filling or fabric. They can also wear out your blanket faster.

*   **Water Temperature:** Always use cold water. Cold water is gentle on fabrics and fillings. It helps prevent shrinking and fading. Hot water can damage the internal beads and outer fabric.
*   **Wash Cycle:** Select a gentle or delicate cycle. This setting uses less agitation. It protects the blanket's seams and internal structure. Avoid heavy-duty or normal cycles. These are too harsh for weighted blankets.
*   **Spin Speed:** Choose a low spin speed. A high spin speed can put excessive strain on your washing machine. It can also cause the blanket to clump. A low spin helps remove excess water without harsh force.

### Detergent and Additives

The type and amount of detergent you use are important. Harsh chemicals can damage your blanket. Too much detergent can leave residue.

*   **Mild Detergent:** Use a mild, liquid detergent. Avoid powdered detergents, as they may not dissolve completely. Leftover powder can leave residue on the blanket. Look for detergents free of harsh dyes and perfumes.
*   **Amount:** Use a small amount of detergent. Weighted blankets do not need much soap to get clean. Too much can be hard to rinse out. It can also leave the blanket feeling stiff.
*   **Avoid Bleach and Fabric Softener:** Never use bleach. Bleach can damage the fabric fibers and the internal filling. Avoid fabric softeners too. They can build up on the blanket and make it less breathable. Fabric softener can also reduce the weight distribution of the beads over time.
*   **Washing Machine Cleaning:** After washing a heavy blanket, it is a good idea to clean your washing machine. Heavy items can sometimes leave residue or strain the machine. You can learn how to clean a washing machine with vinegar or explore how to clean your washing machine inside for best results.

By following these specific steps, you can successfully wash your weighted blanket in the machine. This approach cleans the blanket effectively. It also protects its integrity and your appliance. Taking these precautions saves you trouble in the long run.

## Hand Washing Your Weighted Blanket: When and How

Not all weighted blankets are suitable for machine washing. Very heavy blankets or those with delicate covers might need a gentler approach. Hand washing is a safe alternative. It gives you more control over the cleaning process. I find hand washing can be quite relaxing.

This method is perfect for preserving delicate fabrics. It also prevents potential damage to your washing machine. Learn when to hand wash and how to do it right.

### When to Choose Hand Washing

Hand washing is a good choice in specific situations. It is especially useful for blankets that are too heavy for your machine. It also protects sensitive materials.

*   **Overweight Blankets:** If your blanket is heavier than 20 pounds, hand washing is usually safer. The sheer weight when wet can damage most home washing machines. Commercial machines might still be an option, but hand washing is a sure bet at home.
*   **Delicate Fabrics:** Blankets with silk, satin, or very fragile outer covers benefit from hand washing. The gentle motion of hand washing protects these materials from tearing or snagging. Machine agitation can be too harsh for them.
*   **"Spot Clean Only" Labels:** If your care label says "spot clean only," then hand washing is the next best thing for a full clean. This usually means the blanket is not designed for full immersion or agitation.
*   **No Access to Large Machines:** If you do not have access to a large capacity washing machine or laundromat, hand washing becomes your primary option. It ensures you can still clean your blanket effectively at home.

### Hand Washing Steps

Hand washing a weighted blanket requires space and patience. You can use a large tub, a clean bathtub, or a large basin. Ensure the area is clean before you begin.

1.  **Fill with Cool Water:** Fill your chosen tub or basin with cool or lukewarm water. Avoid hot water, as it can damage the blanket's filling and fabric. Cold water is gentle and effective for most dirt.
2.  **Add Mild Detergent:** Pour a small amount of mild, liquid detergent into the water. Swirl the water gently to mix the detergent. Make sure it dissolves completely. Use only enough to create a slight lather.
3.  **Submerge the Blanket:** Carefully place the weighted blanket into the water. Allow it to fully submerge. Press down gently to ensure the blanket absorbs water. This helps the cleaning solution penetrate the fibers.
4.  **Gentle Agitation:** Gently agitate the blanket by hand. Swish it around in the water. Gently press and squeeze sections of the blanket. Focus on areas with visible dirt or stains. Do not wring or twist the blanket harshly. This can damage the internal structure or seams.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Drain the soapy water. Refill the tub with clean, cool water. Gently press and lift the blanket to rinse out the detergent. Repeat this process several times until no soap suds remain. Thorough rinsing is important to prevent residue.
6.  **Remove Excess Water:** This is a crucial step. Gently press down on the blanket to squeeze out as much water as possible. Do not lift the entire wet blanket unless you have help. It will be incredibly heavy. Instead, roll it up tightly and press to push water out. You can also press it against the side of the tub.

Hand washing provides a controlled and gentle cleaning method. It helps extend the life of your weighted blanket. It keeps it clean without the risks of machine washing for unsuitable blankets.

## Drying Your Weighted Blanket: The Crucial Final Step

Drying a weighted blanket correctly is just as important as washing it. Incorrect drying can lead to mold growth, uneven weight distribution, or damage to the blanket. Weighted blankets hold a lot of water. They need proper air circulation to dry completely. I learned this the hard way with my first blanket.

Patience is key during the drying process. Rushing it can cause more harm than good. Follow these steps for best results.

### Air Drying: The Safest Method

Air drying is usually the safest and most recommended method for weighted blankets. It is gentle on the blanket's materials. It also prevents potential damage from high heat.

*   **Choose a Flat Surface:** Lay the blanket flat on a clean, dry surface. A large drying rack or several clean towels spread on the floor work well. This helps distribute the weight evenly and prevents stretching.
*   **Ensure Air Circulation:** Place the blanket in an area with good airflow. A room with open windows or a fan helps speed up drying. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can fade some fabrics.
*   **Flip and Rotate:** Flip the blanket every few hours. This ensures both sides dry evenly. Also, rotate it to prevent moisture from pooling in one spot. This helps dry the internal filling.
*   **Patience is Key:** Air drying can take a long time, sometimes several days. The heavier the blanket, the longer it will take. Do not rush this step. The blanket must be completely dry before use or storage. Any dampness can lead to mold or mildew.

### Tumble Drying: When and How

Some weighted blankets can be tumble dried. Always check the care label first. If the label allows it, use the lowest heat setting possible. High heat can damage the plastic pellets or glass beads. It can also shrink or damage the fabric.

*   **Low Heat Setting:** Use the "air dry" or "no heat" setting if available. If not, select the lowest heat setting. Heat can melt or deform the weighted fillers. It can also damage the outer fabric.
*   **Large Capacity Dryer:** Use a large capacity dryer, preferably a commercial one. A small home dryer might not have enough space for the blanket to tumble freely. It also might struggle with the blanket's weight.
*   **Add Dryer Balls:** Throw a few dryer balls into the machine. These help separate the blanket. They improve airflow and reduce drying time. They also help redistribute the weighted beads evenly.
*   **Check Frequently:** Stop the dryer every 30-60 minutes. Take the blanket out and redistribute the filling. Shake it out and fluff it. This prevents clumping and ensures even drying.
*   **Ensure Complete Dryness:** This is critical. The blanket must be bone dry before you store it or use it. Even slight dampness can cause mold or mildew. If unsure, air dry for an additional day.

### Avoiding Common Drying Mistakes

*   **Do Not Hang Wet Blankets:** Avoid hanging a soaking wet weighted blanket on a clothesline. The weight of the water can stretch and damage the fabric and seams. It can also cause the filling to shift permanently.
*   **Avoid High Heat:** Reiterate: high heat is the enemy of weighted blankets. It can melt plastic pellets, crack glass beads, and damage fabric. Always opt for low or no heat.
*   **Do Not Store Damp:** Never store a weighted blanket if it is even slightly damp. This is a primary cause of mold and mildew. Ensure it is completely dry to the touch, inside and out.

Proper drying ensures your weighted blanket remains clean, fresh, and functional. It protects your investment and ensures comfort for years to come.

## Maintaining Your Weighted Blanket: Beyond Just Washing

Proper care extends the life of your weighted blanket far beyond just washing. Regular maintenance helps keep it fresh, clean, and effective. Thinking about ongoing care helps preserve its comfort. I always try to take these extra steps.

These practices minimize the need for frequent deep washes. They help maintain the blanket's quality. Small efforts can make a big difference.

### Regular Spot Cleaning

Daily life can bring small spills or minor dirt. Spot cleaning addresses these issues quickly. This reduces the need for a full wash.

*   **Act Quickly:** Address spills as soon as they happen. The faster you act, the easier it is to remove the stain. Fresh stains are less likely to set.
*   **Mild Soap and Water:** Use a clean cloth dampened with cool water and a tiny bit of mild soap. Gently blot the affected area. Do not rub vigorously, as this can spread the stain or damage the fabric.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Use a separate clean, damp cloth to blot away any soap residue. Then, use a dry cloth to absorb excess moisture. Allow the spot to air dry completely before using the blanket again.

### Using a Duvet Cover

A removable duvet cover is a game-changer for weighted blanket maintenance. It acts as a protective layer. This cover takes the brunt of daily use and dirt.

*   **Protective Barrier:** The duvet cover prevents direct contact with the weighted blanket itself. It catches spills, pet hair, and body oils. This keeps the inner weighted blanket cleaner for longer.
*   **Easy to Wash:** Most duvet covers are much lighter and easier to machine wash than the weighted blanket. They fit into standard washing machines. You can wash them frequently without stress.
*   **Variety and Style:** Duvet covers come in many colors and fabrics. You can change the look of your blanket easily. This also allows you to choose covers suitable for different seasons.

### Proper Storage

When you are not using your weighted blanket, storing it correctly is important. Good storage prevents dust, odors, and damage. It also keeps the blanket ready for its next use.

*   **Ensure Dryness:** Before storing, make absolutely sure the blanket is completely dry. Any lingering moisture can lead to mildew and a musty smell. This is the most crucial storage rule.
*   **Breathable Bag:** Store the blanket in a breathable storage bag or a clean cotton sheet. Avoid airtight plastic bags. These can trap moisture and odors.
*   **Cool, Dry Place:** Choose a cool, dry place for storage. Avoid basements or attics where humidity and temperature can fluctuate greatly. A closet or a dedicated linen shelf is ideal.
*   **Flat or Loosely Folded:** Store the blanket flat if possible, or fold it loosely. Avoid compressing it tightly for long periods. This can put stress on the internal filling and seams.

By integrating these maintenance practices, you can enjoy your weighted blanket for many years. Regular care keeps it fresh, extends its lifespan, and ensures its continued comfort.

## Addressing Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Even with the best care, sometimes issues can arise when washing or using your weighted blanket. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems can save you stress and money. I have faced some of these myself.

Understanding common problems helps you react effectively. It ensures your blanket remains a source of comfort. Let's look at some frequent concerns.

### Dealing with Uneven Weight Distribution

Sometimes after washing, the filling in your weighted blanket might clump or shift. This leads to an uneven feel. It can make the blanket less effective.

*   **During Drying:** When drying, especially in a dryer, stop the cycle often. Take the blanket out and shake it vigorously. This helps redistribute the beads or pellets. Fluff it and pat it to loosen any clumps.
*   **Manual Adjustment:** If the blanket is dry but still feels uneven, lay it flat. Gently push and massage the filling into the empty pockets. You can spend some time kneading the blanket to spread the weight evenly.
*   **Duvet Cover Helps:** Using a duvet cover can sometimes help. Many covers have ties inside. These ties attach to loops on the weighted blanket. They help hold the blanket in place and prevent shifting.

### Fading or Fabric Damage

Washing can sometimes cause fabrics to fade or show wear. This is usually due to harsh detergents or incorrect water temperature.

*   **Cold Water Always:** Always use cold water for washing. Hot water is more likely to cause colors to bleed or fade. It also puts more stress on fibers.
*   **Gentle Detergent:** Stick to mild, liquid detergents. Harsh chemicals or bleaches can strip color. They can also weaken fabric over time.
*   **Inside Out:** If your blanket has a vibrant color or delicate design, wash it inside out. This protects the outer surface from rubbing against the washing machine drum.
*   **Air Dry:** For very delicate fabrics, air drying is preferred. Dryer heat can be too intense. It can cause fading or damage.

### Odor After Washing

If your blanket has a lingering odor after washing, it usually means it did not dry completely. Mold or mildew can grow quickly in damp conditions.

*   **Ensure Complete Dryness:** The most common reason for odor is dampness. You must ensure your blanket is bone dry before storing or using it. This might take several days of air drying.
*   **Re-wash with Vinegar:** If it smells, re-wash the blanket. Add about half a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle instead of fabric softener. Vinegar is a natural deodorizer and mildew killer. You can also explore how to clean a smelly washing machine if the odor persists, as it might be coming from your appliance.
*   **Sunlight (Cautiously):** For strong odors, short periods in indirect sunlight can help. Sunlight is a natural disinfectant. However, do not leave it in direct, harsh sun for too long, as it can cause fading.

### Washing Machine Strain

Weighted blankets are heavy. They can put a lot of strain on your washing machine. This can lead to noise or even damage.

*   **Do Not Overload:** Never overload your machine. If the blanket takes up more than 60-70% of the drum space, it is too heavy. Take it to a laundromat or hand wash it.
*   **Balance the Load:** Place the blanket evenly in the drum. Do not let it clump on one side. An unbalanced load can cause the machine to shake violently. This can damage the internal components.
*   **Machine Maintenance:** After washing heavy items, it is good practice to clean your washing machine. Regular cleaning prevents build-up and keeps your machine running smoothly. Learn how to clean your washing machine inside or how to clean washing machine with bleach. A clean filter is also important; consider how to clean washing machine filter if you notice issues.

By understanding these common issues and their solutions, you can better care for your weighted blanket. You can also protect your washing machine. This ensures a long, comfortable life for your blanket.

## When to Seek Professional Cleaning or Replacement

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a weighted blanket might need professional help or even replacement. Knowing when to call in the experts or buy a new blanket is important. This saves you from frustration and ensures you always have a safe, clean blanket. I consider these options when personal efforts fall short.

Professional cleaning can handle tricky situations. Replacing a blanket is necessary when it becomes too damaged or unsanitary.

### When Professional Cleaning is Recommended

Professional cleaners have specialized equipment and knowledge. They can handle large or delicate items that are difficult to clean at home.

*   **Excessively Heavy Blankets:** If your weighted blanket is very heavy (over 20-25 pounds) and your home washing machine cannot handle it, professional cleaning is a good option. They have industrial-sized machines. These machines can manage the weight without issues.
*   **"Dry Clean Only" Labels:** Some weighted blankets, especially those with very delicate outer fabrics or unique fillings, might be labeled "dry clean only." Professional cleaners are equipped to handle these specific instructions. Attempting to wash these at home can ruin them.
*   **Severe Stains or Odors:** For deep-set stains that won't come out with spot cleaning or persistent, strong odors after multiple washes, a professional might have stronger, safer solutions. They can often remove what home methods cannot.
*   **Internal Damage Concerns:** If you suspect the internal filling pockets are compromised but are unsure how to repair them, a professional might be able to assess and advise. They might even offer repair services for certain types of blankets.

Before you take your blanket to a professional, call ahead. Ask if they have experience with weighted blankets. Confirm their process and pricing. This ensures they can meet your specific needs.

### Knowing When to Replace Your Weighted Blanket

Even with the best care, weighted blankets do not last forever. There comes a time when replacement is the most practical choice. Recognizing these signs helps you decide.

*   **Significant Filling Leakage:** If your blanket is consistently leaking beads or pellets, its internal structure is compromised. This means the individual weight pockets are torn. Once this starts, it's very difficult to repair effectively. The blanket will lose its even weight distribution.
*   **Unremovable Odors or Stains:** If, despite thorough washing and professional cleaning attempts, your blanket retains persistent, foul odors or unsightly stains, it might be time to replace it. A blanket that smells bad or looks dirty cannot provide true comfort or hygiene.
*   **Major Fabric Damage:** Extensive tears, fraying, or irreparable damage to the outer fabric can signal the end of its life. If the fabric is too worn, the internal filling is less protected. This can also make the blanket uncomfortable to use.
*   **Loss of Effectiveness:** Over time, if the filling shifts permanently and cannot be redistributed, the blanket loses its therapeutic weight distribution. If it no longer provides the comforting pressure you bought it for, it is no longer serving its purpose.
*   **Age and Wear:** Like any textile, weighted blankets have a lifespan. After several years of regular use and washing, the materials will naturally break down. If your blanket feels less soft, less comfortable, or simply worn out, it might be time for a new one.

Deciding to replace a weighted blanket is a personal choice. It is based on its condition and how well it still meets your needs. Investing in a new one ensures you continue to enjoy the benefits of a clean, functional weighted blanket.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common questions people ask about washing weighted blankets.

### How often should I wash my weighted blanket?
You should wash your weighted blanket every few months, or as needed. If you use a duvet cover, wash the cover every 1-2 weeks. This keeps the blanket underneath cleaner. Spot clean minor spills immediately. Frequent washing of the entire blanket is not usually necessary.

### Can I use a standard washing machine for a heavy weighted blanket?
A standard home washing machine may not be suitable for blankets over 15-20 pounds. The weight of a wet, heavy blanket can strain and damage your machine. For heavier blankets, use a large capacity commercial washing machine at a laundromat. You can also hand wash it.

### What kind of detergent is best for weighted blankets?
Use a mild, liquid detergent for washing weighted blankets. Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, or fabric softeners. Harsh products can damage the blanket's fabric and internal filling. They can also leave residue. A small amount of gentle detergent is usually enough.

### Why is my weighted blanket clumping after washing?
Clumping often happens if the blanket isn't dried evenly. The internal filling
