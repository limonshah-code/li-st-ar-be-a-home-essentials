An air source heat pump moves heat between your home and the outside air. It uses a refrigerant cycle, similar to a refrigerator, to absorb heat from one place and release it in another. This process heats your home in winter and cools it in summer efficiently.

## Understanding Air Source Heat Pump Technology

An air source heat pump looks like an air conditioner. It takes heat from the outside air, even when temperatures are low. This heat then transfers inside to warm your home. In summer, the process reverses. The heat pump pulls heat from inside your home and releases it outdoors.

This technology uses electricity to move heat, not create it. This makes it much more efficient than traditional heating systems. Traditional systems burn fuel to generate heat. Heat pumps simply relocate existing heat. This difference translates into lower energy consumption for heating and cooling.

### How ASHPs Work

Air source heat pumps operate on a simple principle. They use a refrigerant to absorb and release heat. During winter, a fan draws outdoor air over a coil filled with cold refrigerant. Even in cold temperatures, the air contains some heat. The refrigerant absorbs this heat and vaporizes.

A compressor then increases the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant vapor. This hot vapor moves to an indoor coil. Here, it releases its heat to your home's air or water system. The now cooled refrigerant condenses back into a liquid. It then returns to the outdoor unit to repeat the cycle. In summer, the flow reverses. The indoor coil absorbs heat, and the outdoor unit releases it. This provides efficient cooling for your living spaces.

### Key Components of an ASHP System

An air source heat pump system has several main parts. The outdoor unit contains a coil, a fan, and a compressor. This unit handles the heat exchange with the outside air.
