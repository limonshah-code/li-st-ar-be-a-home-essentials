### Understanding Your Ooni: Models and Fuel Types

Before you fire up your Ooni, it helps to understand the different models and their fuel sources. Ooni offers several fantastic pizza ovens, each designed for a specific fuel or combination. Knowing your model helps you prepare for cooking. This knowledge ensures you have the right setup and fuel ready.

Ooni offers models like the Koda, Fyra, and Karu. The Ooni Koda ovens are gas-powered. They offer instant heat and easy temperature control. Gas ovens are convenient for quick setup and consistent cooking.

The Ooni Fyra is a wood pellet oven. It uses small, compressed wood pellets for fuel. Wood pellet ovens provide a subtle smoky flavor. They are also highly efficient and reach high temperatures quickly. You simply fill the hopper with pellets.

The Ooni Karu models are multi-fuel ovens. They can use wood or charcoal for an authentic wood-fired taste. Some Karu models also have a gas burner attachment. This versatility allows you to choose your preferred cooking experience. You get the best of both worlds.

Each fuel type offers a unique cooking experience. Gas provides ease and consistency. Wood pellets give efficiency and subtle smoke. Wood and charcoal offer a traditional, intense smoky flavor. Regardless of your model, understanding its fuel is the first step to incredible pizza. Knowing your oven helps you choose the right accessories and prepare for cooking.

### Setting Up Your Ooni Pizza Oven for Success

Proper setup is crucial for both safety and performance when using your Ooni pizza oven. You need a stable and safe location. The right surface protects your property. It also makes your cooking experience more enjoyable and worry-free.

First, choose a suitable surface for your Ooni. It must be sturdy, level, and non-combustible. A metal table, stone countertop, or outdoor kitchen unit works well. Avoid placing the oven on plastic tables or anything flammable. The oven gets very hot on the outside. You can read more about [what can I put my Ooni pizza oven on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-can-i-put-my-ooni-pizza-oven-on) for specific recommendations. Ensure there is enough clearance around the oven. Keep it away from walls, fences, and anything that could catch fire. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended clearances.

Next, assemble your Ooni according to the instructions. Most Ooni ovens are easy to set up. This usually involves attaching legs, inserting the pizza stone, and connecting the chimney (if applicable). Make sure the pizza stone is seated correctly and evenly. A well-placed stone ensures proper heat distribution.

Finally, connect your fuel source. For gas ovens, securely attach the gas regulator to the propane tank. Check for any leaks using soapy water on the connections. Bubbles indicate a leak, so tighten connections or replace parts if needed. For wood pellet or wood/charcoal ovens, ensure the fuel tray or hopper is clean and ready. Fill it with the appropriate fuel before lighting. Proper setup prevents problems and ensures a smooth cooking session.

### Preheating Your Ooni to Optimal Pizza Temperature

Preheating your Ooni pizza oven to the correct temperature is the single most important step for achieving perfect, crispy-crusted pizzas. Your Ooni needs to get extremely hot to cook pizza in just 60-90 seconds. This intense heat cooks the crust quickly and evenly, creating that signature leopard-spotted char. If your oven is not hot enough, your pizza will cook slowly and likely turn out soggy.

The target temperature for your Ooni's baking stone is typically between 800°F and 950°F (400°C and 500°C). To begin, ignite your Ooni according to your specific model's instructions. For gas ovens, turn on the gas flow and press the igniter. For wood pellet or wood/charcoal ovens, light your fuel using a natural fire starter. You can find detailed instructions on [how to light an Ooni pizza oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-light-an-ooni-pizza-oven). Allow the oven to heat up for at least 15-25 minutes, depending on the model and outside temperature.

Use an infrared thermometer to check the temperature of the pizza stone. Point the laser directly at the center of the stone. This tool gives you an accurate reading of the cooking surface temperature. Do not rely solely on the air temperature inside the oven. The stone temperature is what truly matters for your crust. Continue heating until your thermometer reads within the ideal range. This ensures your Ooni is ready to deliver a fast, professional-grade cook. Proper preheating is key to getting your [Ooni pizza oven hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-your-ooni-pizza-oven-hot) enough for incredible results.

### Preparing Your Pizza Dough and Toppings

The success of your Ooni pizza cooking also heavily relies on proper dough and topping preparation. An Ooni oven cooks pizza incredibly fast. This means your dough needs to be resilient and your toppings ready. Getting these elements right makes a huge difference in your final product.

First, focus on your dough. A good Ooni pizza dough is typically a high-hydration Neapolitan-style dough. This type of dough yields a light, airy, and chewy crust. It also handles the extreme heat well. Make sure your dough balls are proofed correctly. They should be easy to stretch but still have structure. I find it helpful to make my dough a day or two in advance. This gives it more flavor and makes it easier to work with.

When stretching your dough, use a generous amount of flour or semolina on your work surface and pizza peel. This prevents the dough from sticking. Many Ooni users prefer semolina flour for dusting their peels. It acts like tiny ball bearings, helping the pizza slide off smoothly. It also burns less easily than standard flour at high temperatures. If you do not have semolina, you can use regular flour. Some people even use fine [cornmeal in Ooni pizza oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-cornmeal-in-ooni-pizza-oven) for dusting. Be gentle when stretching to avoid tearing the dough.

For toppings, remember that less is often more. Heavy or wet toppings will make your pizza soggy and difficult to cook quickly. Spread your sauce sparingly. Use fresh mozzarella torn into pieces instead of shredded cheese. Add a light scattering of your favorite ingredients. Prepare all your toppings in small bowls before you start cooking. This setup creates an efficient assembly line. You can quickly top your pizza and get it into the oven.

### Launching and Cooking Your Perfect Pizza in the Ooni

Launching your pizza into the Ooni oven is a critical step that takes a little practice. A smooth launch ensures your pizza lands perfectly on the hot stone. Once inside, the cooking process is incredibly fast. You will need to be attentive and quick.

To launch your pizza, first make sure your pizza peel is well-floured or dusted with semolina. This prevents sticking. Quickly assemble your pizza on the peel. Work fast, as the dough can start to stick if it sits too long. Once topped, give the peel a gentle shake to ensure the pizza moves freely. If it sticks, lift the edge of the dough and add more flour underneath. A sticky pizza will ruin your launch.

With the Ooni fully preheated, hold the peel low and close to the oven opening. Angle the peel down slightly. In one swift, confident motion, slide the pizza off the peel and onto the hot stone. Think of it as pulling the peel out from under the pizza, rather than pushing the pizza in. The pizza should land flat in the center of the stone.

Once launched, your pizza will cook very quickly, usually in 60-90 seconds. You must rotate it frequently to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. Use your turning peel to rotate the pizza every 20-30 seconds. Lift the pizza slightly and spin it. This exposes all sides to the intense flame. Watch for the crust to puff up and get those beautiful dark leopard spots. The cheese should be bubbly and melted. When the crust is golden and crispy, and the toppings are done, carefully remove the pizza with your peel. Slice it immediately and enjoy your perfectly cooked Ooni pizza.

### Managing Heat and Fuel During Your Pizza Session

Keeping your Ooni at the right temperature throughout your cooking session is essential for consistent results. After cooking the first pizza, the stone temperature can drop slightly. Knowing how to maintain heat ensures every pizza comes out as perfect as the last. Different Ooni models require different heat management techniques.

For gas-powered Ooni ovens, heat management is straightforward. You simply adjust the flame intensity using the control knob. If the oven cools down between pizzas, turn the flame up to its maximum setting for a few minutes. Check the stone temperature with your infrared thermometer. Once it returns to the ideal 800-950°F range, you can launch your next pizza. Some users prefer to keep the flame on high throughout, only adjusting it down slightly if the pizza cooks too fast or burns. My personal tip is to give the oven about 5 minutes to reheat the stone after each pizza. This ensures the stone is piping hot for the next launch.

If you are using a wood pellet Ooni, like the Fyra, maintaining heat involves refueling the hopper. As pellets burn, the flame may diminish. Keep an eye on the hopper and add more pellets as needed to keep the flame strong and consistent. The design of these ovens generally provides good airflow. This helps maintain high temperatures once they are up to heat. For larger cooking sessions, have a ready supply of pellets. This prevents heat loss.

For multi-fuel Ooni ovens running on wood or charcoal, you need to manage your fuel bed. Add small pieces of wood or charcoal to maintain the flame and heat. Keep a watchful eye on the flame behind the oven. If it starts to shrink, add more fuel. For optimal results, use kiln-dried hardwood. It burns hot and clean. Consistent fuel management helps you [keep your Ooni pizza oven hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-ooni-pizza-oven-hot) for endless delicious pizzas.

### Post-Cooking Care: Cooling Down and Cleaning Your Ooni

After you finish cooking all your delicious pizzas, it is important to properly cool down and clean your Ooni pizza oven. This care ensures the longevity of your oven. It also keeps it ready for your next pizza night. Neglecting cleaning can lead to residue buildup and impact future performance.

First, focus on safely extinguishing your Ooni. For gas ovens, turn off the gas control knob on the oven. Then, close the valve on your propane tank. This stops the fuel supply. For wood pellet or wood/charcoal ovens, simply let the remaining fuel burn out naturally. Do not try to extinguish the flame with water. You can also block the airflow to speed up the process if your oven allows it. It is important to know [how to put out an Ooni pizza oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-out-ooni-pizza-oven) correctly to ensure safety.

Once the flame is out, allow your Ooni to cool down completely. This can take several hours, depending on ambient temperature. Never attempt to clean a hot or warm oven. The pizza stone is extremely hot and can crack if subjected to sudden temperature changes. Trying to clean a hot oven also poses a burn risk. Patience is key here.

After the oven is cool, you can begin cleaning. The most important part to clean is the pizza stone. Use a stiff brush, like Ooni’s pizza oven brush, to scrape off any burnt food bits or flour. Do not use soap or water on the pizza stone. The porous stone will absorb the soap, and your next pizza will taste like soap. The high heat from cooking usually incinerates most food residue. The stone will naturally darken over time, which is normal. For the oven body, simply wipe it down with a damp cloth to remove any soot or grease. Ensure all parts are dry before storing. Regular cleaning ensures your Ooni remains in top condition for many years of pizza making.
