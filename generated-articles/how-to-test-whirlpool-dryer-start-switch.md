## Easily Test Your Whirlpool Dryer Start Switch

Has your Whirlpool dryer stopped spinning? Perhaps it hums, but the drum stays still. A common culprit for this frustration is a faulty start switch. This small but vital component completes an electrical circuit, telling your dryer's motor to begin its cycle. If it fails, your clothes stay wet. I understand how disruptive a broken dryer can be in a busy household. This guide helps you diagnose the problem yourself. We will explore how to test your Whirlpool dryer start switch using simple tools. By the end, you will know if your switch is the issue and what steps to take next. Let's get your laundry routine back on track!

### Takeaway

*   Always disconnect power to the dryer before any repair.
*   A multimeter is essential for testing continuity in the start switch.
*   A working start switch shows continuity when pressed and none when released.

To test a Whirlpool dryer start switch, disconnect power, access the switch, and use a multimeter to check for continuity. A working switch will show continuity when pressed and open when released, indicating proper electrical flow for dryer operation.

## Understanding Your Whirlpool Dryer's Start System

Your Whirlpool dryer relies on several parts to start. The start switch is a key component in this system. It acts like a gatekeeper for electricity. When you push the "Start" button, you activate this switch. The switch then allows power to flow to the dryer's motor.

Without a functional start switch, the motor receives no signal. This means your dryer will not spin. Even if other components work, the dryer remains idle. The switch is typically a momentary contact switch. This means it only makes contact and completes the circuit while you press it. Once you release the button, the circuit breaks again. This simple action is crucial for your dryer's operation.

A faulty start switch can show several symptoms. You might press the button, and nothing happens at all. Sometimes, the dryer hums, but the drum does not turn. This indicates the motor may get some power, but not enough to start. It could also mean other components are failing. However, the start switch is a good first place to check. Understanding its role helps you pinpoint the problem quickly. We can then test it properly.

## Essential Tools for Testing Your Dryer Start Switch

Before we begin the testing process, gather your tools. Having the right equipment makes the job easier and safer. You do not need many specialized items. Most are common tools found in a typical toolbox. I always make sure everything is ready before I start.

First, you will need a multimeter. This device measures electrical properties. It will check for continuity in the start switch. You can find multimeters at any hardware store. They are affordable and useful for many home repairs. Make sure your multimeter has a continuity setting. This setting often beeps when it detects a complete circuit.

Next, you will need a screwdriver set. Both Phillips head and flathead screwdrivers are helpful. These will remove access panels and fasteners. Some Whirlpool dryer models may use Torx bits, so a versatile set is best. A pair of needle-nose pliers can also be useful for disconnecting wires. Sometimes, wire connectors are tight. Pliers give you a better grip.

You should also have a flashlight or headlamp. Dryer interiors can be dark. Good lighting helps you see small components clearly. A small container for screws is also a good idea. It prevents losing tiny fasteners during disassembly. Having these tools ready saves time and frustration. It also ensures you can safely and effectively test your Whirlpool dryer start switch.

## Safety First: Preparing for Your Dryer Repair

Safety is the most important step in any appliance repair. Working with electricity carries risks. I cannot stress this enough: always put your safety first. Skipping safety steps can lead to serious injury or damage. We will handle electrical components. Proper preparation prevents accidents.

First, disconnect the dryer from its power source. This means unplugging the dryer from the wall outlet. If your dryer is hard-wired, you must turn off the circuit breaker. Find your home's main electrical panel. Locate the breaker labeled for your laundry room or dryer. Flip it to the "OFF" position. I recommend double-checking it. You can even use a non-contact voltage tester. This device confirms no power is reaching the dryer.

Allow the dryer to cool down completely. If it was recently running, parts can be hot. Burn hazards exist. Give it ample time to cool before you touch any internal components. Clear the area around the dryer. Make sure you have enough space to work safely. Remove any clutter that could trip you. Good lighting is also crucial for safety. It helps you see what you are doing clearly.

Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Gloves can protect your hands from sharp edges inside the dryer. Safety glasses protect your eyes from dust or falling debris. Following these safety precautions creates a secure working environment. You can then focus on accurately testing your Whirlpool dryer start switch without worry. Never rush safety steps.

## Locating the Start Switch on Your Whirlpool Dryer

Finding the start switch is your next step. Its exact location can vary slightly between Whirlpool dryer models. However, it is usually behind the control panel or near the dryer's front. Accessing it requires some disassembly. Do not worry; it is a straightforward process. I will guide you through it.

First, you need to gain access to the control panel. On many Whirlpool dryers, the control panel is held in place by screws. These screws might be along the back edge of the top panel. Some models have screws hidden under plastic caps. Carefully remove these caps if present. Use your Phillips head screwdriver to remove the screws. Once the screws are out, the control panel may lift up. It might also slide forward or backward. Gently maneuver it to expose the components beneath. Be careful not to pull too hard. Wires are still connected.

On some models, you might need to remove the top panel of the dryer first. This usually involves screws along the back. After removing these, the top panel lifts off. This gives you better access to the control panel area. The start switch is typically part of the main control panel assembly. It will be directly behind the "Start" button you press. You will see wires connected to its terminals. These wires send the electrical signal. Note how the wires are connected. Taking a picture with your phone can be helpful for reassembly.

The start switch usually has two or more terminals. These are where the wires attach. It might be a small button-like switch or a slightly larger component. Remember its position and how wires connect. This helps when you reconnect everything. Having located the switch, we are ready for the actual test. Knowing its precise spot ensures you test the correct part.

## Performing the Continuity Test on the Start Switch

Now it's time for the actual test. This involves using your multimeter to check for continuity. Continuity means there is a complete electrical path. This test tells us if the start switch can properly complete the circuit. I find this part quite satisfying. It gives a clear answer to whether the switch is working.

First, set your multimeter to the continuity setting. This setting often looks like a speaker icon or a series of concentric arcs. If your multimeter has an audible beep, it will sound when continuity is detected. If it only displays numbers, it will show a very low resistance (close to zero ohms) for continuity. An "OL" or "1" reading indicates no continuity.

Next, disconnect the wires from the start switch terminals. You might need your needle-nose pliers for this. Make sure you remember which wire goes to which terminal. Taking a quick photo helps here. With the wires removed, the switch is isolated. This ensures you are only testing the switch itself, not other parts of the dryer's circuit.

Now, place one multimeter probe on each terminal of the start switch. The probes are the metal tips connected to your multimeter. Hold the probes firmly against the terminals. The display should read "OL" or "1" (open circuit) at this point. This means no continuity when the button is not pressed. Then, press and hold the start button down. While holding the button, observe your multimeter. If the switch is working correctly, the multimeter should beep or show a reading close to zero ohms. This indicates continuity. Release the button, and the reading should return to "OL" or "1". This means the circuit is open again. This is the critical test for your [Whirlpool dryer start switch](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-will-my-whirlpool-dryer-not-start).

## Interpreting Your Multimeter Readings

You have performed the continuity test. Now, let's understand what the multimeter results mean. Interpreting these readings tells you the condition of your start switch. This step gives you the definitive answer about the switch's health. I find it empowers you to make informed decisions.

A healthy Whirlpool dryer start switch will exhibit specific behavior. When you place the multimeter probes on its terminals and the button is *not* pressed, your multimeter should show an "OL" (Over Limit) or "1" reading. This indicates an open circuit. This is correct. The switch should only complete the circuit when activated. When you press and hold the start button, the multimeter should beep, or its display should change to a very low resistance value. This value will typically be close to 0 ohms. This indicates continuity, meaning the circuit is closed. Releasing the button should return the multimeter to an "OL" or "1" reading. This pattern means your start switch is working as designed. It makes contact when pressed and breaks contact when released.

If your multimeter behaves differently, the start switch is likely faulty. For example, if you press the button and the multimeter *still* shows "OL" or "1" (no continuity), the switch is bad. It means the internal contacts are not closing. The switch cannot complete the circuit. Your dryer will not start because the signal never reaches the motor. Alternatively, if the multimeter beeps or shows continuity *without* you pressing the button, the switch is also bad. This means the contacts are stuck closed. This is a less common failure, but it can prevent the dryer from stopping properly or cause other electrical issues. Both scenarios point to a defective start switch. A faulty start switch needs replacement.

## Next Steps If Your Start Switch Is Bad (or Good)

You have tested your Whirlpool dryer start switch. Now you know its condition. What do you do next? Your action depends on whether the switch passed the test. I will walk you through both scenarios. This helps you move forward with your dryer repair.

### If Your Start Switch Is Bad

If your multimeter showed no continuity when pressed, or continuous continuity when not pressed, your start switch is faulty. The solution is to replace it. This is a common and relatively inexpensive repair. You can order a new Whirlpool start switch online or from an appliance parts store. Make sure you get the correct part number for your specific dryer model. When the new switch arrives, reverse the steps you took to remove the old one. Connect the wires to the new switch's terminals exactly as they were on the old one. Reassemble the control panel and any other parts you removed. Plug the dryer back in or turn the circuit breaker on. Test your dryer. It should now start normally. Replacing a faulty switch often solves the "Whirlpool dryer won't start" problem directly.

### If Your Start Switch Is Good, But Dryer Still Won't Start

If your start switch passed the continuity test, the problem lies elsewhere. Do not be discouraged. Many other components can prevent a dryer from starting. This just means you have ruled out one common issue. Now you must investigate other parts.

*   **Door Switch:** A common culprit is the door switch. The dryer will not start if it thinks the door is open. Test the door switch for continuity. If it fails, replace it.
*   **Thermal Fuse:** A blown thermal fuse prevents the dryer from starting at all. It is a safety device that trips if the dryer overheats. Check for continuity. If there is no continuity, the fuse is blown and needs replacement. Remember, a blown thermal fuse indicates an underlying problem, often airflow restriction. You might need to [clean your Whirlpool dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-whirlpool-dryer) thoroughly.
*   **Drive Belt:** The drive belt connects the motor to the drum. If it is broken, the motor may hum, but the drum will not turn. Open the dryer cabinet to inspect the belt. A broken belt needs replacement.
*   **Motor:** Less common, but possible, is a faulty motor. If the motor hums but does not turn the drum, even with a good belt and start switch, the motor could be failing. This is a more involved repair.
*   **Main Control Board:** Sometimes, the issue is with the main control board. This board sends signals to all components. If it fails, the dryer may not respond to the start button. Testing control boards is complex. It often involves ruling out all other components first.
*   **Power Supply Issues:** Ensure the dryer receives proper power. Check the outlet and circuit breaker. Sometimes, a dryer "turns on but not start" due to insufficient power. See why your [Whirlpool dryer turns on but not start](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dryer-turn-on-but-not-start). Or even if your [Whirlpool dryer won't start but has power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-dryer-start-but-has-power).
*   **Heating Element:** While not directly related to starting, a faulty heating element can cause other issues. Learn [how to test Whirlpool dryer heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-whirlpool-dryer-heating-element) if you experience no heat.

Systematic troubleshooting is key. Check each component one by one. This approach helps you narrow down the exact cause. You are capable of fixing these issues.
