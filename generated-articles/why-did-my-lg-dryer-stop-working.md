## Power Problems: The First Check for Your LG Dryer

When your LG dryer stops working, the first step is always to check its power source. Many dryer issues begin and end with simple electrical problems. Do not assume the worst right away. Start with the basics before moving to complex diagnostics.

First, confirm the dryer is fully plugged into the wall outlet. Sometimes, the vibration from use can cause the plug to loosen. A loose plug prevents the dryer from getting enough power. This can stop it from starting or cause it to stop mid-cycle. Make sure the plug is pushed firmly into the outlet.

Next, check your home's circuit breaker box. Dryers require a dedicated 240-volt circuit. If the circuit becomes overloaded, the breaker will trip. This cuts power to the dryer. Look for a breaker that is in the "off" position or in between "on" and "off." Flip it completely off, then firmly back to the "on" position. If the breaker trips again immediately or frequently, you may have an underlying electrical problem that needs professional attention. Do not keep resetting a breaker that repeatedly trips. This indicates a serious issue.

Finally, test the electrical outlet itself. Plug another appliance, like a hairdryer or a lamp, into the same outlet the dryer uses. If the other appliance does not work, the problem is with the outlet or the wiring to it. You might need an electrician to inspect and repair the outlet. Never attempt to work on electrical outlets if you are uncomfortable or lack proper experience. Safety comes first when dealing with electricity. Taking these initial power checks seriously can save you time and money. It often points directly to the solution when your LG dryer has no power.

## Clogged Vents and Lint Traps: Airflow Issues

A common reason your LG dryer stops working, or stops heating effectively, is poor airflow. This issue typically stems from a clogged lint trap or a blocked dryer vent system. Restricted airflow causes the dryer to overheat. When this happens, safety mechanisms activate. These mechanisms prevent damage to the dryer and reduce fire hazards.

Always clean your dryer's lint trap before every load. This simple habit helps maintain good airflow. Over time, lint can build up in the trap. This thick layer of lint blocks the air from moving freely through the drum and out the vent. When air cannot escape, moisture cannot evaporate from your clothes. The dryer then runs longer and works harder without drying properly. This extra strain can cause components to fail prematurely.

Beyond the lint trap, the entire dryer vent system can become clogged. This includes the ductwork running from the back of the dryer to the outside of your home. Lint bypasses the trap and accumulates in these ducts. Pet hair, dryer sheets, and even small clothing items can also create blockages. A clogged vent is a major fire hazard. It also causes your dryer to take much longer to dry clothes. Eventually, the dryer may overheat and shut off completely. Its thermal fuse may blow.

You should clean your dryer vent system at least once a year. You can do this yourself with a dryer vent cleaning kit. These kits usually include a brush that attaches to a drill. This allows you to reach deep into the vent pipe. If your vent is long or complex, consider hiring a professional vent cleaning service. Regular cleaning ensures efficient operation. It also extends the life of your LG dryer. Proper airflow is essential for the dryer to function correctly and safely. Many dryer problems simply go away once the air can flow freely.

## Understanding Common Component Failures

Several key components within your LG dryer can fail, causing it to stop working. Identifying which part has failed requires some careful inspection. Understanding these common failure points helps you troubleshoot effectively. Many people find similar issues when their [GE dryer stops working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-did-my-ge-dryer-stop-working) or their [Maytag dryer stops working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-did-my-maytag-dryer-stop-working), as these parts are common across brands.

One of the most frequent culprits is the **thermal fuse**. This is a safety device. It blows or trips when the dryer overheats. It acts like a circuit breaker for temperature. A blown thermal fuse means the dryer will not start or heat at all. Overheating usually happens due to a clogged vent or lint trap. So, if your thermal fuse is blown, clean your vents thoroughly before replacing the fuse. Otherwise, the new fuse will likely blow again quickly.

The **heating element** is another critical component. If your LG dryer runs but produces no heat, the heating element is often the problem. The heating element consists of a coil that glows red when powered, generating the heat needed to dry clothes. Over time, these coils can break or burn out. You can sometimes visually inspect the element. Look for breaks in the coil. A multimeter can confirm if it has continuity.

The **door switch** ensures the dryer only runs when the door is fully closed. If the door switch is faulty, the dryer will not start. It might also stop mid-cycle if the switch intermittently loses contact. You can test the door switch for continuity with a multimeter. Many LG dryers have a simple plunger-style switch. When the door closes, it presses the plunger. This completes the circuit. If the switch breaks internally, the circuit remains open.

Finally, the **drive belt** is essential for spinning the dryer drum. If the belt breaks, the motor will hum, but the drum will not turn. You might hear the motor running, but the clothes remain wet and stationary. Replacing a drive belt usually involves opening the dryer cabinet. This job requires careful attention to detail. Always disconnect power before working inside your dryer. These components are wear items. They will eventually fail with normal use. Replacing them can often extend the life of your LG dryer.

## Sensor and Control Board Malfunctions

Modern LG dryers rely heavily on various sensors and a central control board to operate efficiently. When these components malfunction, your dryer can behave erratically or stop working altogether. Understanding how these parts interact helps in diagnosing more complex issues.

The **moisture sensor** is crucial for automatic drying cycles. LG dryers use one or more moisture sensors to detect the dampness of the clothes inside the drum. The dryer stops when the sensors indicate the clothes are dry. If these sensors become dirty or faulty, they might give incorrect readings. Dirty sensors often get coated with fabric softener residue or lint. This makes them less sensitive. The dryer might then stop too early, leaving clothes damp. Or, it might run indefinitely, never sensing dryness. You can often clean moisture sensors with a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol. They are typically located on the front bulkhead of the dryer drum, usually as two metal strips.

The **thermistor**, or temperature sensor, monitors the air temperature within the dryer. This sensor sends temperature data to the control board. If the thermistor fails, the dryer might overheat, underheat, or stop working as a safety precaution. A faulty thermistor can cause cycles to run too long or shut off prematurely. This often triggers specific error codes on the dryer's display.

The **main control board**, sometimes called the PCB (Printed Circuit Board), acts as the dryer's brain. It processes information from all the sensors, manages cycles, and sends commands to other components like the motor and heating element. A control board failure can lead to a wide range of problems. The dryer might not power on at all, or specific functions may fail. It might display constant error codes. Sometimes, only a part of the board fails, leading to specific malfunctions like no heat or no spin. Control board issues are harder to diagnose. You might need to check voltage outputs or replace the board. This is often a job for a professional. For similar control board issues that can manifest in different appliances, consider learning more about why your [LG microwave stopped heating](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-did-my-lg-microwave-stop-heating) or if your [LG microwave just stopped working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-did-my-lg-microwave-just-stopped-working) as the diagnostics for electronics share common principles.

Before replacing a control board, rule out all other possibilities. Control boards are expensive parts. Sometimes, a power surge can damage them. If you suspect a sensor or control board issue, check for error codes first. These codes often provide specific clues to the underlying problem.

## Motor and Drum Problems in Your LG Dryer

If your LG dryer hums but the drum does not spin, or if it makes loud noises during operation, the problem likely lies with the motor or the components related to drum rotation. These issues can prevent the dryer from functioning correctly.

The **drive motor** powers the drum's rotation and also typically drives the blower fan. If the motor fails, the drum will not turn, and the dryer will not dry clothes. You might hear a humming sound if the motor tries to start but cannot. This could indicate a seized motor, a broken motor winding, or a problem with the motor's centrifugal switch. Sometimes, the motor simply burns out from old age or overuse. Replacing a drive motor is a complex task. It often requires significant disassembly of the dryer.

The **drive belt** connects the motor to the dryer drum. It wraps around the drum and a motor pulley. If this belt breaks, the drum will not spin. You can often hear the motor running freely without the resistance of the drum. This is a common failure point. Over time, the rubber material of the belt can fray, crack, or snap. To check the drive belt, you usually need to open the top or front panel of your dryer. If the belt is broken, you will find it loose or wrapped around the motor shaft. Replacing the belt is a common DIY repair. You must correctly route the new belt around the drum and the idler pulley.

The **idler pulley** maintains tension on the drive belt. It is a small wheel that presses against the belt. If the idler pulley seizes or breaks, the drive belt can lose tension or snap. This leads to the drum not spinning. A faulty idler pulley often produces squealing or grinding noises when the dryer runs. Similarly, **drum rollers** support the dryer drum and allow it to spin smoothly. Most dryers have two or four rollers. Over time, these rollers can wear out, flatten, or seize up. Worn rollers often cause thumping or loud squealing noises as the drum rotates. If a roller completely breaks, the drum may sag or stop turning altogether.

Inspecting these components usually requires disassembling the dryer's outer shell. Always unplug the dryer before attempting any internal inspections or repairs. These mechanical issues are usually repairable. Replacing these parts can significantly extend the life of your LG dryer.

## Advanced Troubleshooting Steps and Safety

When basic checks do not resolve why your LG dryer stopped working, you may need to perform more advanced troubleshooting. This often involves using a multimeter and taking essential safety precautions.

Always prioritize safety. Before touching any internal components, **unplug your LG dryer** from the wall outlet. Even if the dryer appears off, stored electricity can deliver a dangerous shock. If you need to test live circuits, proceed with extreme caution or call a professional. Wear insulated gloves.

A **multimeter** is a valuable tool for diagnosing electrical faults. It measures voltage, current, and continuity.
*   **Checking continuity:** This is the most common test for dryer components. Set your multimeter to the continuity setting (often indicated by a speaker icon or ohms symbol). Place the probes on each terminal of the component you are testing.
    *   For a thermal fuse, a good fuse will show continuity (a beep or a reading of zero/very low ohms). A blown fuse will show no continuity ("OL" or open circuit).
    *   For a heating element, it should show a certain resistance (ohms) if good. No continuity means it is broken.
    *   For a door switch, test it in both open and closed positions. It should show continuity in one position and no continuity in the other, depending on its type.
*   **Checking voltage:** You can use a multimeter to check if power is reaching specific components, like the motor or heating element terminals. This requires the dryer to be plugged in and potentially running, making it a high-risk task. Only do this if you are experienced with electrical testing. You are checking for 240 volts AC across the main terminals.
*   **Checking wiring:** Visually inspect all wiring connections inside the dryer. Look for frayed wires, burnt insulation, or loose terminals. Rodent damage can also occur. A loose or damaged wire can prevent a component from receiving power. Secure any loose connections or replace damaged wires.

Accessing internal components requires disassembling parts of the dryer. You might need screwdrivers, nut drivers, and pliers. Keep track of screws and panels. Take photos as you disassemble to help with reassembly. Many online resources and service manuals provide detailed diagrams for specific LG dryer models. Consult these guides for precise instructions. If at any point you feel uncertain or uncomfortable, stop. It is better to seek professional help than to risk injury or further damage to your appliance. Understanding these steps empowers you to tackle more complex issues.
