## Common LG Dryer Error Codes and Their Meanings

LG dryers use specific codes to indicate various problems. Understanding these common codes helps you diagnose the issue quickly. I will list some of the most frequently encountered codes and explain what they mean. Knowing these can save you a lot of troubleshooting time.

### D80, D90, D95 (Duct Restriction Errors)

These codes are very common. They all point to issues with airflow restriction.
*   **D80:** Indicates that the exhaust duct is 80% blocked.
*   **D90:** Suggests a 90% blockage in the exhaust duct.
*   **D95:** Means the exhaust duct is 95% or more blocked. This is a severe restriction.

These errors prevent proper air circulation. They can cause your dryer to overheat or clothes to remain damp. The dryer cannot dry efficiently if air cannot escape. These codes are a strong signal to check your venting system. Addressing duct restriction is crucial for dryer performance and safety. A blocked vent can even be a fire hazard.

### TE1, TE2, TE3, TE4 (Thermistor Errors)

These codes relate to the dryer's temperature sensors, known as thermistors.
*   **TE1:** Indicates an open or shorted thermistor circuit. The dryer cannot accurately read temperature.
*   **TE2, TE3, TE4:** These often point to specific thermistor malfunctions or temperature readings outside the normal range. They mean the dryer is unable to sense the correct temperature inside.

A faulty thermistor can cause your dryer to overheat or not heat at all. It may also lead to excessively long drying times. The dryer's control board relies on these sensors to regulate heat. If the thermistor is faulty, the control board receives incorrect information. This can disrupt the drying cycle.

### FLOW SENSOR (Airflow Sensor Error)

Some LG dryer models have a dedicated airflow sensor. This sensor monitors the air moving through the dryer.
*   **FLOW SENSOR:** This error means the airflow sensor detects an issue with air circulation. It is very similar to the D80/D90/D95 codes but uses a different sensor.

This code signals inadequate airflow. It can be due to lint buildup or a clogged vent. A malfunctioning airflow sensor itself can also trigger this code. This sensor ensures the dryer maintains optimal airflow for efficient drying. If it detects a problem, it stops the cycle to prevent damage or safety risks.

### FE (Fan Motor Error)

This code points to a problem with the dryer's fan motor.
*   **FE:** Indicates that the fan motor is not operating correctly or at all. The fan motor is responsible for moving air through the dryer and out the exhaust vent.

If the fan motor fails, air cannot circulate properly. This can lead to overheating or poor drying performance. You might hear unusual noises or no fan noise at all. A faulty fan motor can severely impact the dryer's ability to remove moisture. This problem requires prompt attention to restore dryer function.

### LE (Motor Overload/Locked Motor Error)

The LE code indicates an issue with the dryer's main drive motor.
*   **LE:** This means the motor is overloaded or locked. It may struggle to turn the drum.

This can happen if the drum is overloaded with too many clothes. It can also point to a problem with the motor itself or the drive belt. The motor might be trying to spin but cannot. This safety feature prevents damage to the motor if it cannot operate freely. Checking the drum for obstructions and ensuring it is not overloaded is a good first step.

### OE (Obstruction/Drain Error - Condenser Dryers)

This error is specific to condenser or ventless LG dryers.
*   **OE:** Indicates an obstruction in the condenser drainage system. Water cannot properly drain.

Condenser dryers collect moisture in a reservoir. This reservoir needs regular emptying. The OE code often means the drain pump is blocked or the reservoir is full. It can also indicate a clog in the drain hose. Proper drainage is essential for these dryers to remove moisture from clothes. If you have an LG dryer, learning [why does my LG dryer have water in it](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-have-water-in-it) can help diagnose this specific issue.

### AE (Airflow/Humidity Sensor Error)

This code suggests a problem with the air sensor or humidity sensor.
*   **AE:** Indicates that the air sensor or humidity sensor is faulty. This sensor detects the moisture level in the clothes.

If this sensor malfunctions, the dryer cannot accurately determine when clothes are dry. This can lead to over-drying or under-drying. The sensor is crucial for the automatic drying cycles. A common cause is lint buildup on the sensor itself. Cleaning the sensor can sometimes resolve this issue.

### PF (Power Failure Error)

This error code is usually simple to understand.
*   **PF:** Indicates that the dryer experienced a power failure during a cycle.

This means the power supply to the dryer was interrupted. It could be due to a tripped circuit breaker or a brief power outage. The dryer notes this interruption. You will need to reset the dryer or check your home's electrical panel. This code itself does not indicate a dryer malfunction.

### NP (No Power/Main Power Issue)

Similar to PF, but often points to a more fundamental power supply problem.
*   **NP:** Means the dryer is not receiving sufficient power. This is usually due to a wiring issue or incorrect voltage.

This code might appear if the dryer is not properly plugged in. It could also indicate a circuit breaker issue or a problem with the wall outlet. For specific guidance on power issues, you can learn [how to fix LG dryer no power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-dryer-no-power). Always check the power cord and circuit breaker first. This is a critical safety check.

### CE (Communication Error)

This code is less common but can occur.
*   **CE:** Indicates a communication problem between the dryer's main control board and other components.

This might suggest a loose wire connection or a faulty control board. It means the different parts of the dryer are not "talking" to each other. This is often a job for a professional technician.

### CL (Child Lock Error)

This is not a malfunction code but a status indicator.
*   **CL:** Means the child lock feature is activated. This prevents unintended operation.

If you see CL, the dryer controls are locked. You cannot start or change cycles. To resolve this, simply deactivate the child lock. The method varies by model, but it often involves holding down a specific button for a few seconds. Consult your manual for the exact button combination.

### DR (Door Open Error)

Another status indicator, not a malfunction.
*   **DR:** Means the dryer door is open or not properly latched. The dryer will not start if the door is open.

Ensure the door is fully closed and latched. Check for any obstructions preventing it from closing. The door switch might also be faulty. A closed door is a safety requirement for dryer operation.

## How to Interpret Specific LG Dryer Error Codes

Interpreting LG dryer error codes involves more than just knowing what they stand for. It means understanding the context and planning your next steps. I will elaborate on the interpretation of some key codes and outline the initial troubleshooting actions you can take.

### Dealing with D80, D90, D95 (Duct Restriction)

When you see a D80, D90, or D95 code, your dryer is yelling for clear air. This is a common and important issue. It is critical to address these codes quickly. Restricted airflow reduces efficiency and poses a fire hazard.

*   **Check the Lint Filter:** This is always your first step. A clogged lint filter is a primary cause of airflow issues. Clean it thoroughly after every load. For detailed instructions, refer to how to clean filter on LG dryer.
*   **Inspect the Vent Hose:** Disconnect the vent hose from the back of the dryer. Look inside for lint buildup or obstructions. Lint can accumulate heavily here.
*   **Clean the Dryer Vent Duct:** The duct running through your wall to the outside needs regular cleaning. This can be a long, flexible or rigid pipe. Use a specialized dryer vent brush or call a professional vent cleaner. A dirty vent is the number one reason why LG dryers stop drying effectively. Sometimes, you might need to adjust your venting setup. For example, if your dryer needs to be vented from the side, you can explore guides like [how to vent LG dryer out the side](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-vent-lg-dryer-out-the-side) or [can an LG dryer be vented from the side](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-an-lg-dryer-be-vented-from-the-side). Proper installation is key to avoiding these error codes.
*   **Check the Outside Vent Hood:** Ensure the vent flap outside your house is not blocked. Birds' nests or debris can easily obstruct it. I often find this to be an overlooked culprit.
*   **Clear the Condenser (for ventless models):** If you have a ventless condenser dryer, the condenser unit itself can become clogged with lint. This requires specific cleaning steps outlined in your manual.

After cleaning, clear the code by pressing the start/pause button or power cycling the dryer. Run a small load to see if the code reappears.

### Resolving TE1, TE2, TE3, TE4 (Thermistor Issues)

Thermistor errors mean the dryer is having trouble sensing temperature. This affects drying performance.

*   **Reset the Dryer:** First, try unplugging the dryer for a few minutes. Then plug it back in. This simple power cycle can sometimes clear a temporary glitch.
*   **Locate and Inspect the Thermistor:** The thermistor is a small sensor. It is usually located near the heating element or the blower housing. You will likely need to remove the back or front panel of your dryer to access it.
*   **Clean the Thermistor:** Lint or debris on the thermistor can interfere with its readings. Gently clean it with a soft brush or cloth. Be careful not to damage it.
*   **Check Wiring:** Look for any loose or corroded wires connected to the thermistor. Secure any loose connections.
*   **Test Resistance (Advanced):** If you have a multimeter, you can test the thermistor's resistance. Compare the reading to the specifications in your service manual. If the resistance is out of range, the thermistor is faulty and needs replacement. This is a more advanced diagnostic step.

If cleaning and checking connections do not work, the thermistor likely needs replacement. This part is relatively inexpensive. However, installation can be tricky for a novice.

### Understanding FE (Fan Motor Error)

An FE code means your dryer's fan motor is not working right. This directly impacts airflow.

*   **Check for Obstructions:** First, ensure no foreign objects are caught in the blower wheel. Small items like socks or coins can get past the lint filter. This can jam the fan.
*   **Examine the Blower Wheel:** Access the blower housing (often near the motor). Inspect the blower wheel for damage or blockages.
*   **Check Motor Connections:** Ensure all wires leading to the fan motor are secure. Look for any signs of burning or fraying.
*   **Listen for Sounds:** If you hear unusual grinding or no sound from the fan, the motor may be failing.

If the fan motor is faulty, it will need replacement. This is a more involved repair. It may require professional assistance.

### Addressing LE (Motor Overload/Locked Motor)

The LE code indicates a problem with the drum motor.

*   **Reduce Load Size:** The most common cause is overloading the dryer. Always ensure you are not putting too many items into the drum. Large, bulky items can also cause this.
*   **Check for Obstructions:** Ensure no items are caught between the drum and the dryer housing. Sometimes a small item can get wedged.
*   **Inspect the Drive Belt:** The drive belt wraps around the drum and motor. If it is broken or slipped off, the drum will not spin. You will need to remove panels to check this.
*   **Manual Drum Spin:** Try to turn the drum by hand when the dryer is unplugged. If it is hard to turn, there might be a mechanical issue with the motor or bearings.

If the problem persists after reducing the load and checking for obstructions, the motor or its components might be failing. This often requires a professional repair.

### Handling OE (Obstruction/Drain Error - Condenser Dryers)

For ventless LG dryers, an OE code relates to water drainage.

*   **Empty the Water Reservoir:** This is the simplest fix. The reservoir may be full and needs emptying.
*   **Clean the Condenser:** The condenser unit in these dryers collects lint and moisture. It needs regular cleaning. Consult your manual for specific instructions on how to remove and clean it. This usually involves rinsing it under water.
*   **Check the Drain Hose/Pump (if applicable):** If your dryer is plumbed to drain automatically, check the drain hose for kinks or clogs. The drain pump might also be obstructed or faulty.

These steps help ensure proper moisture removal. Neglecting drainage can lead to moisture buildup inside the dryer.

### Fixing AE (Airflow/Humidity Sensor Error)

The AE code points to issues with the sensor that detects moisture.

*   **Clean the Sensor Bars:** Many LG dryers have two small metal strips inside the drum, usually near the lint filter. These are the humidity sensors. Lint and fabric softener residue can build up on them. Clean them gently with rubbing alcohol and a soft cloth or paper towel. Avoid abrasive cleaners.
*   **Check Wiring:** Ensure the wires connected to the humidity sensor are secure.
*   **Ensure Proper Load Size:** Very small loads might not make contact with the sensor bars. This can sometimes trigger an AE code.

Regular cleaning of these sensor bars is crucial for accurate drying cycles.

## Troubleshooting LG Dryer Errors: Initial Steps

Once you identify an LG dryer error code, you can take some initial troubleshooting steps. My advice is always to start with the simplest solutions. Many issues can be resolved without calling a technician.

### Power Cycle the Dryer

This is the universal first step for almost any electronic device problem. Unplug the dryer from the wall outlet. Wait for about 5-10 minutes. Then, plug it back in. This hard reset can clear temporary glitches in the dryer's control board. It is like restarting your computer. A power cycle can often resolve minor electronic hiccups that trigger error codes like CE, TE, or even some power-related ones.

### Clean the Lint Filter Thoroughly

A clogged lint filter is a common culprit for many dryer problems, especially those related to airflow (D80, D90, D95, FLOW SENSOR). Remove the lint filter and clear all visible lint. You should do this after every load. Even a thin layer of lint can restrict airflow significantly. Sometimes, fabric softener residue can build up on the screen. This invisible film can also block airflow. If you suspect residue, wash the filter with warm, soapy water and a soft brush. Rinse it well and let it dry completely before putting it back. For comprehensive steps, see [how to clean filter on LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-on-lg-dryer).

### Inspect and Clear the Dryer Vent

The dryer vent system is critical for your dryer's performance and safety. Blockages here are a primary cause of airflow-related errors (D80, D90, D95).

*   **Behind the Dryer:** Disconnect the vent hose from the back of your dryer. Use a vacuum cleaner to remove lint and debris from the hose and the dryer's exhaust port. Check the hose for kinks or damage.
*   **Through the Wall/Ceiling:** The duct running from your dryer to the outside often collects lint. Use a dryer vent cleaning brush kit to clear this duct. These kits are available at most hardware stores.
*   **Outside Vent Hood:** Go outside and check the vent hood on your house. Ensure the flap opens freely and there are no obstructions like bird nests, leaves, or lint buildup. For more general advice on keeping your dryer clean, consider reading [how to clean your dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-dryer). Consistent cleaning prevents many common issues that lead to error codes.

### Check for Overloading

An overloaded dryer can cause the motor to strain, leading to errors like LE (Motor Overload). It also prevents proper airflow and drying. Make sure you are not stuffing too many clothes into the drum. Items should tumble freely. Follow your dryer's capacity guidelines. Distribute the load evenly. Heavy, bulky items can sometimes trick the dryer into thinking it is overloaded.

### Ensure Proper Leveling

While not directly related to most error codes, an unlevel dryer can cause excessive vibration and strain on components over time. This might indirectly contribute to mechanical failures. Use a level tool to check that your dryer is balanced on all four feet. Adjust the leveling feet as needed.

These initial steps are often sufficient to resolve common LG dryer error codes. By systematically checking these areas, you empower yourself to fix many issues without professional help. If your LG dryer is not drying after clearing codes, it is often a sign that the underlying issue was not fully resolved.

Sometimes, basic troubleshooting of LG dryer error codes is not enough. There are instances where the problem goes beyond simple fixes. Knowing when to call a professional technician is important. It can save you time, prevent further damage, and ensure your safety.

### Persistent Error Codes

If an error code reappears quickly after you attempt a fix, the problem is likely more complex. For example, if you clean the vent thoroughly, and the D90 code returns, there might be a deeper blockage or a faulty sensor. A professional has specialized tools to diagnose hidden issues. They can perform more detailed checks than a homeowner can.

### Electrical or Component Failures

Some error codes point to internal component failures. Codes like CE (Communication Error) or issues related to specific electrical parts often require expert attention. For instance, if a thermistor is truly faulty (not just dirty), replacing it involves working with electrical connections. Replacing a main control board or a motor is also complex. These tasks are best left to trained technicians. They understand wiring diagrams and safely handle electrical components.

### Safety Concerns

Any issue involving gas, high voltage electricity, or potential fire hazards demands professional help. If your dryer emits a burning smell, sparks, or if you suspect a gas leak (for gas dryers), turn it off immediately. Disconnect the power. Do not attempt to fix these issues yourself. Safety is always the top priority. Technicians are trained to work safely with these systems.

### Lack of Tools or Expertise

You might not have the right tools or the necessary expertise for certain repairs. For example, replacing a drive belt or blower wheel requires disassembling parts of the dryer. This can be intimidating. If you are uncomfortable with such tasks, a professional service is the best option. They have the right tools and experience to complete the repair correctly.

### Warranty Considerations

Attempting complex repairs yourself might void your dryer's warranty. Check your LG dryer's warranty terms before starting any major repair. If your dryer is still under warranty, calling an authorized LG service technician is usually the best course. They can perform the repair without voiding your coverage.

A professional service call is an investment in the longevity and safe operation of your LG dryer. While I encourage DIY for simple fixes, knowing your limits is smart. My philosophy is always to put safety first.

## Preventive Maintenance for Your LG Dryer: Avoiding Future Errors

Regular maintenance is key to keeping your LG dryer running smoothly. It helps prevent common error codes and extends your appliance's lifespan. I find that a little effort upfront saves a lot of hassle later.

### Clean the Lint Filter Every Load

This is the simplest and most important task. A clean lint filter ensures proper airflow. It helps your dryer run efficiently. It also prevents fire hazards. Lint buildup is the leading cause of dryer fires and airflow-related error codes like D80, D90, D95. Make it a habit to clean it after every single load. This prevents lint from accumulating in the dryer's internal components and exhaust system.

### Inspect and Clean the Dryer Vent Annually

Your dryer's vent duct collects lint over time. This accumulation restricts airflow, forcing your dryer to work harder. It causes longer drying times and can trigger airflow error codes. I recommend inspecting and cleaning the entire vent system once a year. This includes the hose directly behind the dryer, the duct running through the wall, and the outside vent cap. You can use a dryer vent cleaning brush kit for this. If your vent run is very long or complex, consider hiring a professional vent cleaning service. Proper venting is crucial. An inefficient vent is often why your LG dryer is not drying as it should.

### Clean the Condenser (Ventless Dryers) Regularly

If you have an LG condenser (ventless) dryer, the condenser unit collects lint and moisture. This unit requires regular cleaning to maintain efficiency. Refer to your owner's manual for specific instructions. Typically, you remove the condenser unit and rinse it under running water to clear lint. The frequency of cleaning depends on usage, but monthly or quarterly is a good guideline. Neglecting this can lead to OE errors and poor drying.

### Wipe Down Humidity Sensors

Some LG dryers use humidity sensors to detect dryness. These are usually two small metal bars inside the dryer drum, near the lint filter. Over time, fabric softener residue or lint can build up on them. This interferes with accurate drying. Gently wipe these sensors with a soft cloth and rubbing alcohol every few months. This ensures your dryer senses moisture levels correctly, preventing issues like clothes being too damp or over-dried. This can also help prevent AE errors.

### Check the Dryer Exhaust Port

The area where the dryer vent hose connects to the dryer can also collect lint. Disconnect the hose occasionally and vacuum out any lint buildup from the dryer's exhaust port. Ensure the connection is secure when you reattach the hose. Loose connections can lead to air leaks and reduced efficiency.

### Avoid Overloading the Dryer

Overloading strains the motor and other components. It also prevents clothes from tumbling freely, leading to uneven drying and longer cycle times. This can contribute to the LE error code. Always follow your dryer's capacity recommendations. Divide large loads into smaller ones if necessary.

By performing these simple maintenance tasks, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering LG dryer error codes. You will also improve your dryer's performance and extend its operational life. Proactive care is always better than reactive repair.
