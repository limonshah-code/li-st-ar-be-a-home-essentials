## Finding the Right Water Filter for Your Kenmore Refrigerator

Ensuring clean, fresh water from your refrigerator is important. A key part of this is knowing **what water filter your Kenmore refrigerator uses**. Many people find themselves puzzled by the variety of filters available. I understand this confusion perfectly. Each Kenmore refrigerator model needs a specific filter to work correctly and effectively purify your water.

This guide will help you identify the correct water filter for your Kenmore refrigerator. We will explore where to find your model number and how to use it to select the right filter. I will also explain different filter types and common locations. You will learn about installation, maintenance, and frequently asked questions. This information helps you maintain your Kenmore refrigerator properly.

### Takeaway

*   **Find Your Model Number:** Look for the sticker inside the refrigerator compartment.
*   **Check Existing Filter:** The filter itself often has a part number.
*   **Consult Your Manual:** The user manual lists the correct filter.
*   **Understand Filter Types:** Kenmore uses various internal and external filter designs.
*   **Replace Regularly:** Change your filter every six months for best results.

### Identifying Your Kenmore Refrigerator Water Filter

Your Kenmore refrigerator uses a specific water filter. This filter model is determined by your refrigerator's design and manufacturing year. To find the correct filter, locate your refrigerator's model number. Then, refer to your appliance manual or check the existing filter for its part number. Always choose a filter designed to fit your exact Kenmore model.

## Why Your Kenmore Refrigerator Needs a Water Filter

A water filter is a vital component of your Kenmore refrigerator. It does more than just make water taste better. The filter removes impurities from your tap water before it reaches your dispenser and ice maker. This purification process ensures the water you drink and the ice you use are safer.

Many common tap water contaminants are removed by the filter. These include chlorine, lead, cysts, sediment, and other harmful substances. Over time, these impurities can build up in your water lines. A good filter protects your family's health. It also protects your refrigerator's internal components.

Without a filter, your ice will taste bad. The water dispenser might also deliver cloudy water. Filters are designed to last about six months. After this time, they become less effective. A clogged filter can even reduce water flow. Regular filter replacement maintains water quality. It also keeps your refrigerator running efficiently.

## Locating Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model Number

Finding your Kenmore refrigerator's model number is the first step in identifying the correct water filter. The model number is a unique identifier. It tells you exactly what type of refrigerator you own. This number helps you find compatible parts and accessories, including water filters.

Kenmore places model numbers in several common spots. Most often, you will find a sticker inside the refrigerator compartment. Check along the inside walls or near the top. Some models have the sticker inside the fresh food section, usually on the ceiling or side wall. Others might have it on the kick plate near the bottom.

Sometimes, the model number is located on the back of the refrigerator. You might need to pull the appliance out to see it. Always make sure to write down the full model number. It can be a long string of letters and numbers. Knowing your specific model number makes filter selection simple and accurate. If you have trouble finding it, you can consult our guide on [how to tell which Kenmore refrigerator I have](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-which-kenmore-refrigerator-i-have).

### Common Model Number Locations

*   **Inside the Fresh Food Compartment:** This is the most frequent location. Look on the left or right wall. Sometimes, it is on the ceiling.
*   **On the Kick Plate:** This is a panel at the bottom front of the refrigerator. You might need to open the freezer door to see it clearly.
*   **Behind the Refrigerator:** Less common, but possible. Pull the appliance away from the wall to check the back.
*   **Inside the Freezer Compartment:** Some models have it here, often on a side wall or near the ice maker.

## Decoding Kenmore Water Filter Numbers and Types

Kenmore refrigerators use several types of water filters. Each type has a specific design and a unique part number. Understanding these numbers and designs helps you choose the right replacement. Kenmore filters often start with "ADQ" or "46-", followed by a series of numbers. For example, common Kenmore filter numbers include 9081, 9083, 9020, and 9906. These numbers correspond to different filter styles and capabilities.

There are broadly two main categories of filters: internal and external. Internal filters fit directly into a designated slot inside your refrigerator. They can be twist-in or push-in designs. Twist-in filters rotate into place. Push-in filters slide in until they click. External filters, less common with modern Kenmore refrigerators, connect to the water line behind the unit. They filter all water entering the appliance.

Specific filter numbers relate to their form factor and the contaminants they remove. For instance, the Kenmore 9081 filter is a popular side-by-side refrigerator filter. It usually twists into a compartment in the top right of the fresh food section. The 9083 filter is often found in bottom-freezer models, usually located at the bottom grille. Always match the number on your old filter. This ensures perfect compatibility.

### Common Kenmore Filter Series

*   **ADQ Series (e.g., ADQ36006101, ADQ73214404):** These are often twist-in filters found in various models, including some side-by-side and French door refrigerators. Many popular Kenmore filters are variations of these.
*   **46- Series (e.g., 46-9081, 46-9083, 46-9906):** These are common part numbers used by Kenmore. The "46-" prefix signifies it is a Kenmore appliance part. The numbers that follow indicate the specific filter model.
*   **Generic Filter Numbers (e.g., 9081, 9083, 9020):** These shorter numbers are often used for compatibility. Many third-party filters will list these shorter numbers. Always ensure they are compatible with the full Kenmore part number or your refrigerator model.

## Common Kenmore Refrigerator Water Filter Locations

Knowing where to look for your Kenmore refrigerator water filter simplifies the replacement process. Filters are typically placed in convenient locations. However, the exact spot varies based on your refrigerator's design and model type. I will walk you through the most common placements.

For side-by-side Kenmore refrigerators, the filter often sits in the upper right-hand corner of the fresh food compartment. It might be behind a small cover or door. You simply twist it out to remove it. Some side-by-side models might have it in the bottom grille, below the freezer door.

French door and bottom-freezer Kenmore refrigerators usually place the filter in the lower left-hand corner of the fresh food section. It might be near the crisper drawers. You often push a button or turn a lever to release it. Another common spot for these models is in the bottom grille, in front of the kick plate. You push it in and release it. Our guide on [how to change water filter on Kenmore bottom freezer refrigerator](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-water-filter-on-kenmore-bottom-freezer-refrigerator) provides specific steps for this type.

Older or less common Kenmore models might use an external filter. This filter connects directly to the water line at the back of the refrigerator. You would see it behind the unit. This type of filter is less common in newer models. Knowing these locations helps you quickly find your current filter. This makes identification and replacement much easier.

### Typical Filter Placement by Refrigerator Type

*   **Side-by-Side Refrigerators:**
    *   **Upper right corner of the fresh food compartment:** This is a very common location. Look for a small round or rectangular cover.
    *   **Bottom grille (kick plate):** Below the freezer door, at the very bottom front of the unit. This requires kneeling to see and access.
*   **French Door and Bottom-Freezer Refrigerators:**
    *   **Lower left corner of the fresh food compartment:** Often near the crisper drawers. You might need to remove a shelf or drawer to access it.
    *   **Bottom grille (kick plate):** Similar to side-by-side models, located at the bottom front. This is a common spot for filters like the Kenmore 9083.
*   **Top-Freezer Refrigerators:**
    *   **Inside the fresh food compartment:** Less common for top-freezer models to have internal filters. If they do, it's usually at the back or side.
    *   **External (behind the unit):** Some older top-freezer Kenmore models might use an in-line filter connected to the water supply hose.

## Steps to Identify the Correct Kenmore Water Filter

Identifying the correct Kenmore water filter involves a few clear steps. You do not need to guess which filter to buy. Following these instructions will ensure you get the right fit. This prevents compatibility issues and ensures proper water filtration.

First, check your existing filter. The filter itself usually has a part number printed on it. This is the most reliable way to identify the filter you need. Write down this number exactly as it appears. This number is unique to your filter type.

Second, consult your Kenmore refrigerator's user manual. The manual contains a parts list. This list includes the exact water filter model number for your appliance. If you lost your physical manual, you can often find a digital version online. Just search for "Kenmore refrigerator [your model number] manual."

Third, use online compatibility tools. Many appliance parts websites offer search functions. You simply enter your refrigerator's model number. The website then shows you compatible filters. Some sites even have visual guides to help match your filter. Using these steps will ensure you purchase the correct filter every time.

### Utilizing Resources for Accurate Filter Identification

*   **Examine the Current Filter:** My primary recommendation is to always check the existing filter first. The part number is typically visible. Make sure to note any prefixes or suffixes, such as "ADQ" or "46-".
*   **Refer to the Owner's Manual:** If the filter number is illegible or missing, the owner's manual is your next best source. It details all compatible parts. You can often download a PDF version from the Kenmore or Sears website.
*   **Online Model Number Search:** Enter your refrigerator's full model number into a search engine. This often leads you to parts diagrams or compatibility charts on appliance parts websites. These sites frequently list filters that fit your specific model.
*   **Contact Kenmore Support:** If all else fails, contact Kenmore customer service. Provide them with your refrigerator's model number. They can tell you exactly which filter you need.

## Genuine Kenmore vs. Aftermarket Water Filters

When choosing a replacement filter for your Kenmore refrigerator, you will find two main options: genuine Kenmore (OEM) filters and aftermarket (generic) filters. Both types aim to filter your water, but they have key differences. Understanding these differences helps you make an informed decision.

Genuine Kenmore filters are manufactured by or for Kenmore. They are designed to exact specifications for your refrigerator model. This ensures a perfect fit and optimal performance. OEM filters typically use high-quality filtration media. They meet specific certifications for contaminant removal. This provides peace of mind regarding water purity.

Aftermarket filters are made by third-party companies. They are designed to be compatible with Kenmore refrigerators. These filters are often less expensive than OEM options. While many aftermarket filters work well, their quality can vary. Some might not remove as many contaminants. Others might have fit issues or shorter lifespans.

I always recommend checking certifications like NSF International. This ensures the filter meets standards for contaminant reduction. While aftermarket filters can save money, ensure they provide the filtration level you expect. A good aftermarket filter will state its compatibility with your Kenmore model and its filtration capabilities clearly. Consider the balance between cost savings and performance when making your choice.

### Pros and Cons of Each Type

**Genuine Kenmore (OEM) Filters:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Perfect Fit and Compatibility:** Designed specifically for Kenmore models, ensuring no leaks or installation problems.
    *   **Guaranteed Performance:** Meets Kenmore's quality and filtration standards. Often NSF certified.
    *   **Reliability:** Lower risk of issues or premature failure.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Higher Cost:** Generally more expensive than aftermarket alternatives.
    *   **Limited Availability:** Might only be available through specific retailers.

**Aftermarket (Generic) Filters:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Lower Cost:** Significant savings compared to OEM filters.
    *   **Wider Availability:** Found at more retailers and online stores.
    *   **Variety of Options:** Many brands offer compatible filters.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Variable Quality:** Filtration effectiveness can differ between brands. Not all are NSF certified.
    *   **Potential Fit Issues:** Some generic filters might not fit as precisely, leading to leaks or difficult installation.
    *   **Warranty Concerns:** Using non-OEM parts *could* potentially affect your refrigerator's warranty, though this is rare for filters.

## When and How to Change Your Kenmore Water Filter

Replacing your Kenmore refrigerator water filter regularly is essential. Filters become less effective over time. A clogged filter can reduce water flow and purity. I will explain the best time to change your filter and outline the general steps.

Most Kenmore refrigerators, like most brands, recommend changing the water filter every six months. This timeframe ensures optimal filtration performance. Your refrigerator likely has an indicator light. This light typically turns red or orange when it is time for a replacement. Do not wait for the light to come on if it has been longer than six months. The light is a reminder, but heavy water usage can clog a filter faster.

Changing the filter is usually a simple process. First, locate your current filter. Refer to the common locations we discussed earlier. Next, prepare for potential drips. Place a towel underneath the filter housing. Then, remove the old filter. This usually involves a quarter-turn twist or a firm push and release, depending on the filter type. Be ready for some residual water to spill.

Finally, install the new filter. Remove any protective caps from the new filter. Align it correctly with the housing. Insert it fully and then twist or push until it locks into place. You should hear a click. After installation, flush the system. Dispense several gallons of water through the dispenser. This removes air from the lines and flushes out carbon fines. Reset your filter indicator light according to your refrigerator's manual.

### Troubleshooting Common Water Filter Issues

Sometimes, after changing a water filter, you might experience issues. These problems are usually simple to resolve. I will cover some common troubleshooting tips to help you get your water dispenser and ice maker working perfectly.

**Reduced Water Flow:** If water dispenses slowly, the filter might not be fully seated. Remove and re-insert the filter. Make sure it clicks into place. Air trapped in the lines can also cause this. Flush several gallons of water through the dispenser to clear it. A faulty new filter is rare, but possible.

**Leaking Water:** Leaks often happen if the new filter is not installed correctly. Ensure it is fully twisted or pushed in. Check the O-rings on the filter. They must be present and not pinched. Sometimes, the filter housing itself might be cracked, but this is less common. If your Kenmore refrigerator is leaking water from the water dispenser, it could be filter related. You can find more information on issues like [why is my Kenmore refrigerator leaking water from the water dispenser](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-refrigerator-leaking-water-from-the-water-dispenser). If the leak is from underneath, it might be a different issue, but still worth investigating: [why is my Kenmore refrigerator leaking water from underneath](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-refrigerator-leaking-water-from-underneath).

**Cloudy or Bad-Tasting Water:** This is common immediately after filter replacement. It is caused by carbon fines from the new filter. Flush at least 2-3 gallons of water through the dispenser. The cloudiness and taste should disappear. If it persists, the filter might be faulty, or your water source has other issues.

**Ice Maker Not Working:** A new filter can sometimes affect the ice maker. Reduced water flow from a poorly installed filter might prevent the ice maker from filling. Ensure the filter is correctly installed and flush the lines. If your Kenmore refrigerator needs help making ice, consider checking the filter as a first step; you can find more tips on [how to get my Kenmore refrigerator to make ice](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-my-kenmore-refrigerator-to-make-ice).

If you encounter persistent issues, refer to your refrigerator's manual. Some problems are specific to certain models. Do not hesitate to contact Kenmore customer support for further assistance. It's generally possible to operate a refrigerator without a water filter, though not recommended for optimal water quality. For example, some users ask [can I use my LG refrigerator without the water filter](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-my-lg-refrigerator-without-the-water-filter) or [can I use my Whirlpool refrigerator without the water filter](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-my-whirlpool-refrigerator-without-the-water-filter). While physically possible, removing the filter means you lose the filtration benefits.
