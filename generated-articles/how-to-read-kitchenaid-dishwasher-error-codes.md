## Common KitchenAid Dishwasher Error Codes and Their Meanings

KitchenAid dishwashers display various error codes. Each code points to a specific problem area. Knowing these common codes helps you quickly understand what is wrong. I have encountered many of these over the years. This understanding helps me decide my next steps.

### F1 / E1 Error: Temperature Sensor Fault

This code typically means there is an issue with the NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) sensor. The NTC sensor measures the water temperature. If it fails, the dishwasher cannot accurately heat the water or detect the correct temperature. This can lead to issues with wash cycles. A faulty sensor might also stop the heating element from working.

### F2 / E2 Error: Drain Problem

The F2 or E2 code indicates a drainage issue. The dishwasher cannot pump out water properly. This often leaves standing water at the bottom of the tub. Common causes include a clogged drain hose, a malfunctioning drain pump, or a blocked air gap. I always check the drain filter first. A dirty filter is a frequent culprit.

### F3 / E3 Error: Heating Element Fault

When you see F3 or E3, it suggests a problem with the heating element. This element is responsible for heating the water during the wash and rinse cycles. It also helps dry dishes. A damaged heating element will not heat the water. This leaves dishes dirty or wet. Check for burnt connections or a broken element.

### F4 / E4 Error: Overfill or Leak Detected

This code signals that the dishwasher has detected too much water in the tub or a leak. There is a sensor, often a float switch, that triggers this code. If water levels get too high, the sensor activates. This prevents flooding. A faulty water inlet valve or a leak in the tub can cause this.

### F5 / E5 Error: Wash Pump Issue

The F5 or E5 error points to a problem with the wash pump. This pump circulates water through the spray arms. If it malfunctions, water will not spray effectively. This results in poorly cleaned dishes. A clogged pump impeller or a faulty motor can be the cause. Listen for unusual noises during the wash cycle.

### F6 / E6 Error: Water Inlet Problem

The F6 or E6 code indicates that the dishwasher is not receiving enough water or no water at all. This can be due to a closed water supply valve. It could also mean a kinked inlet hose. A defective water inlet valve is another common reason. Always check the water supply line first. Ensure it is fully open and free of kinks.

### F7 / E7 Error: Diverter Motor Fault

This code suggests an issue with the diverter motor. The diverter motor controls which spray arm gets water. It ensures water is directed to the correct zones for proper cleaning. If this motor fails, water might only reach one part of the dishwasher. This leaves other dishes uncleaned. You might notice inconsistent wash results.

### F8 / E8 Error: Detergent Dispenser Fault

The F8 or E8 error indicates a problem with the detergent dispenser. The dispenser might not be opening to release detergent. It might also be stuck. This leaves your dishes dirty because no soap is used. Check if anything is blocking the dispenser door. Sometimes, it just needs a good cleaning.

### F9 / E9 Error: Control Panel Issue

This code often points to a problem with the electronic control board or user interface. The control panel is the brain of your dishwasher. If it malfunctions, the dishwasher cannot operate correctly. This can cause erratic behavior or prevent cycles from starting. Sometimes a power reset can clear this, but often it requires professional help.

### F0 / E0 Error: Communication Error

The F0 or E0 error means there is a communication problem. This often occurs between the control panel and other components. It signals a general electronic fault. This could be due to loose wiring. It might also be a faulty control board. It is a broad code, often requiring deeper diagnostics.

These codes are your first line of defense. They guide you toward the source of the problem. Always refer to your specific model's manual for the most accurate information.

## Troubleshooting Water-Related KitchenAid Error Codes

Water-related issues are common culprits for KitchenAid dishwasher error codes. These codes often start with F1, F2, F3, or F4. They indicate problems with water filling, draining, or sensing. I have fixed several of these problems myself. It usually involves checking hoses and filters.

### F1 / E1 Error: Water Inlet Issues

The F1 or E1 code typically means the dishwasher is not getting enough water. Your first step is to check the water supply line. Ensure the water valve underneath the sink is fully open. Sometimes, it gets accidentally turned off. Also, inspect the inlet hose for kinks or blockages. A kinked hose restricts water flow.

Next, check the water inlet valve. This valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. If it is clogged or faulty, it will not open properly. You can often hear a buzzing sound if it is trying to work. A technician might need to test or replace this valve. This is a common part that can wear out.

### F2 / E2 Error: Drain Problems

When you see F2 or E2, your dishwasher cannot drain water. This often leaves standing water in the tub. The most common cause is a clogged drain filter. My article, [Where is the filter in KitchenAid dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-filter-in-kitchenaid-dishwasher), explains how to find and clean it. Food particles build up here.

You should also inspect the drain hose. It connects the dishwasher to the sink drain or garbage disposal. Make sure it is not kinked or blocked. Food debris can get stuck inside. If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, ensure the disposal's knockout plug is removed. Run the disposal to clear any blockages.

The drain pump could also be faulty. If you hear a humming sound but no water drains, the pump might be struggling. Sometimes, a small object like a broken piece of glass can jam the impeller. You may need to access the pump to clear it. A technician often handles this repair.

### F3 / E3 Error: Overfill Protection / Leak Detection

The F3 or E3 code indicates an overfill condition or a leak. Your dishwasher has a float switch at the bottom of the tub. This switch detects high water levels. If it rises too high, it triggers this error. A faulty water inlet valve can cause continuous filling. This leads to overfilling.

Look for visible leaks around the base of the dishwasher. Water pooling underneath suggests a leak. Check the door gasket for damage. Also, inspect hose connections for drips. A cracked tub or pump housing can also cause leaks. These issues often require professional repair.

### F4 / E4 Error: Water Heater or Temperature Sensor Issues

This code relates to the water heater or its associated sensor. The dishwasher needs to heat water to specific temperatures. If it cannot do this, dishes will not get clean. Check the heating element for signs of damage or corrosion. It is usually at the bottom of the tub.

The temperature sensor (NTC) might also be faulty. This sensor tells the control board the water's temperature. If it gives incorrect readings, the dishwasher might not heat. You can test these components with a multimeter. For most people, replacing these parts is best left to a professional.

Always remember to disconnect power before inspecting internal components. Safety comes first. By following these steps, you can often resolve common water-related issues. For detailed cleaning steps, refer to [How to clean your KitchenAid dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-kitchenaid-dishwasher).

## Resolving Heating and Sensor KitchenAid Error Codes

Heating and sensor issues are crucial for your dishwasher's performance. These codes often appear as F6, F7, or F8. They relate to how your dishwasher heats water and circulates it. I have learned that clean components often prevent these errors. But sometimes, a part needs replacing.

### F6 / E6 Error: No Heat or Heating Failure

The F6 or E6 code typically indicates that your dishwasher is not heating water. This means your dishes will not get properly sanitized or dried. The most common cause is a faulty heating element. This element looks like a metal coil at the bottom of the tub. Over time, it can burn out.

You can visually inspect the heating element for damage. Look for breaks or scorch marks. If it appears fine, the issue could be with the heating element's thermostat or temperature sensor. These parts regulate the heat. A bad thermostat might prevent the element from turning on. Checking these components often requires a multimeter.

Sometimes, the main control board might also be at fault. If it fails to send power to the heating element, the F6 code will appear. A power reset can sometimes clear this. If not, professional diagnosis might be necessary. Ensuring consistent heat is vital for clean dishes.

### F7 / E7 Error: Diverter Motor Fault

The F7 or E7 error points to a problem with the diverter motor. This motor controls water flow to the different spray arms. It makes sure water sprays effectively in both the upper and lower racks. If the diverter motor fails, water might only spray from one set of arms. This leaves some dishes dirty.

You might notice that only dishes on the bottom rack are clean, for example. Or vice versa. The diverter valve ensures even water distribution. A jammed diverter or a faulty motor can cause this. Sometimes, food debris can block the diverter valve. You might hear a clicking sound but no water redirection.

Accessing the diverter motor often means removing the lower spray arm and potentially the sump assembly. This can be a more involved repair. I usually consult my manual for specific instructions. If the motor is faulty, it will need to be replaced. This helps ensure your entire dish load gets cleaned thoroughly.

### F8 / E8 Error: Wash Pump or Circulation Motor Fault

The F8 or E8 code signals an issue with the wash pump. This pump circulates water throughout the dishwasher. It pushes water through the spray arms to clean dishes. If the wash pump fails, the water will not circulate properly. You will end up with dirty dishes after a full cycle.

Listen for the wash pump during a cycle. If you hear a grinding noise, or no noise at all when water should be spraying, the pump might be at fault. An obstruction in the pump impeller is a common cause. Food debris, broken glass, or even a foreign object can jam it. This prevents the impeller from spinning.

Sometimes, the wash pump motor itself fails. It can burn out over time. Replacing the wash pump is a common repair for this error. This usually involves removing the lower spray arm and the sump assembly. Always disconnect power before attempting any internal repairs. This ensures your safety while working on the appliance.

## Control Panel and Communication KitchenAid Error Codes

Error codes related to the control panel and communication are usually electronic in nature. They signal problems with how different parts of your KitchenAid dishwasher talk to each other. Codes like F0, F9, and others, often point to these issues. These problems can be tricky, but sometimes a simple reset works.

### F0 / E0 Error: Control Board Communication Fault

The F0 or E0 error typically indicates a general communication problem. This means the main control board is not talking correctly to other components. It might be sending or receiving garbled signals. This can prevent the dishwasher from starting any cycle. It might also cause unexpected behavior.

Sometimes, loose wiring connections cause this. Vibrations during cycles can loosen wires. You might need to access the control board to check these connections. Always disconnect power first. A power reset can also clear temporary communication glitches. Turn off the breaker for a few minutes, then restore power.

If the error persists, the control board itself might be faulty. Control boards are complex electronic components. They can fail due to power surges or age. Replacing the main control board is usually a job for a professional technician. It requires careful handling and specific part matching.

### F9 / E9 Error: Overfill Condition (often electronic)

While F4 also indicates overfill, F9 or E9 specifically points to an electronic overfill condition. This means the control board believes there's too much water. However, there might not be a physical leak. This can happen if the float switch or its wiring is faulty. The sensor sends an incorrect "overfill" signal to the board.

Check the float switch at the bottom of the tub. Ensure it moves freely and is not stuck. Also, inspect its wiring for any damage. Sometimes, mineral buildup can prevent the float from moving correctly. A good cleaning can solve this. If the float switch is faulty, it needs to be replaced.

A persistent F9/E9 could also indicate a problem with the water inlet valve. If the valve is not closing completely, water keeps entering the tub. Even if the float switch is working, continuous water entry will trigger this code. This situation requires prompt attention to prevent flooding.

### FoD / EoD Error: Dispenser Open / Detergent Dispenser Fault

The FoD or EoD error often relates to the detergent dispenser. It can mean the dispenser door is stuck open. It might also indicate a problem with the dispenser's internal mechanism. The dishwasher needs to dispense detergent at the correct time in the cycle. If it cannot, the cycle will not run properly.

First, check if anything is physically blocking the dispenser door. Food particles, dried detergent, or even a rogue dish can get in the way. Gently clear any obstructions. Ensure the dispenser closes fully with a click. Sometimes, a thorough cleaning of the dispenser area can resolve the issue.

If the door is clear and still not working, the dispenser mechanism itself might be faulty. The solenoid that opens the door can fail. Or the spring might be broken. Replacing the dispenser assembly is usually the solution for this specific problem. You can usually find tutorials on how to [put KitchenAid Dishwasher back together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-kitchenaid-dishwasher-back-together) after replacing parts like this. This can be a relatively straightforward DIY repair for some.

Electronic errors can be challenging to diagnose without specialized tools. A power cycle is always the first step for any electronic issue. If that does not work, it might be time for a professional. They have the expertise to test control boards and sensors accurately.

## General Troubleshooting Steps for KitchenAid Dishwashers

When your KitchenAid dishwasher displays an error code, there are general troubleshooting steps you can take. These steps apply to many different issues. I find that starting with the simplest solutions often saves time. A systematic approach helps narrow down the problem.
