There is nothing quite as frustrating as pulling laundry from your dryer only to find it still damp or cold. When your Whirlpool dryer stops producing heat, the heating element is a common culprit. I know this can feel like a major problem, but with some basic tools and clear steps, you can diagnose the issue yourself.

This article will guide you through the process of how to test a Whirlpool dryer heating element. We will cover safety precautions, tools needed, and a detailed, step-by-step testing procedure. By understanding these steps, you can pinpoint the problem and decide on the next course of action, saving you time and money on a service call. Let's get your laundry hot and dry again.

### Takeaway

*   Always unplug the dryer before any inspection or testing.
*   Use a multimeter to check the heating element for continuity.
*   A reading of 0 ohms or infinity indicates a faulty heating element.

### Clear Answer to Main Query

To test a Whirlpool dryer heating element, first unplug the dryer for safety. Next, access the heating element by disassembling the dryer's back panel. Finally, use a multimeter set to ohms to check for continuity across the element's terminals; a reading near 0 ohms or a break (infinite ohms) indicates a faulty element.

## Understanding Your Whirlpool Dryer's Heating System

Your Whirlpool dryer uses heat to remove moisture from your clothes. The main component creating this heat is the heating element. It is essentially a large, coiled wire that heats up when electricity flows through it. Think of it like a giant toaster element.

The heating element sits inside a metal housing, often called the heating element assembly. This assembly is usually located at the back of your dryer. Air is drawn into this housing, heated by the element, and then circulated through the dryer drum. This hot air absorbs moisture from your wet clothes.

Several other components work with the heating element to ensure safe and efficient operation. A thermal fuse protects against overheating by cutting power if temperatures get too high. A high-limit thermostat also monitors temperature, preventing the dryer from getting excessively hot. The thermistor, a temperature sensor, helps the control board regulate the heat cycle. When any of these components fail, your dryer might stop heating.

## Common Signs of a Faulty Heating Element

Recognizing the symptoms of a failing heating element helps confirm your suspicion. The most obvious sign is a complete lack of heat. Your dryer runs, the drum spins, and the light comes on, but clothes remain cold and wet after a cycle. This is a strong indicator the heating element is not working.

Sometimes, a heating element may partially fail. This means it produces some heat, but not enough to dry clothes properly. You might notice clothes take an unusually long time to dry, or they feel slightly damp even after a full cycle. This partial heating can also point to a problem with the element itself.

Another less common symptom is a burning smell. This smell can occur if parts of the element are shorting out or if lint has accumulated and is scorching on the element. However, burning smells can also indicate other issues, like a clogged vent, so always investigate carefully.

## Safety First: Preparing for the Test

Before you touch any part of your dryer for testing, prioritize safety. This step is non-negotiable. Working with electrical appliances carries risks, and proper precautions prevent injury. I always make sure these steps are followed.

First, always unplug the dryer from the wall outlet. Do not just turn it off; physically remove the power cord. This disconnects all electrical power to the unit, preventing accidental shock. Next, you need a safe, well-lit workspace. Ensure you have enough room to maneuver around the dryer.

Gather the necessary tools. You will need a Phillips head screwdriver, a nut driver or socket wrench set (typically 1/4-inch and 5/16-inch), and a multimeter. A multimeter is essential for testing electrical continuity. Make sure your multimeter has fresh batteries and that you know how to use it to test ohms (resistance) and continuity. Some multimeters also have an audible continuity setting, which makes testing easier. This preparation ensures a smooth and safe diagnostic process.

## Locating the Heating Element in Your Whirlpool Dryer

Accessing the heating element in a Whirlpool dryer usually requires some disassembly. The exact steps can vary slightly between models, but the general procedure is similar. I will outline the most common approach here. Always refer to your specific model's service manual if you have it.

Most Whirlpool dryers have their heating element located in the back. You will start by pulling the dryer away from the wall to give yourself ample space. Then, carefully remove the rear access panel. This panel is usually secured by several screws around its perimeter. Use your Phillips head screwdriver or nut driver to remove these screws. Keep track of the screws; a small container is useful for this.

Once the screws are out, gently pull the back panel away. You may need to tilt it slightly to clear any clips. With the back panel removed, you should see the heating element housing. It looks like a metal box or chamber, often with a large, coiled wire inside. The element itself will have two terminals where wires connect. Do not rush this step. Take your time to identify the heating element clearly before proceeding with the test.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Testing the Whirlpool Dryer Heating Element

Now that you have accessed the heating element, you are ready to test it. This process uses a multimeter to check for electrical continuity. Continuity means there is an uninterrupted path for electricity to flow through. If the element is good, it will show continuity.

First, set your multimeter to the lowest ohms (Î©) setting, or to the continuity setting if it has one. If it has an audible continuity setting, it will beep when a continuous circuit is detected. Now, disconnect the two wires leading to the heating element. You might need to gently pull them off or use needle-nose pliers. Be careful not to damage the terminals.

Touch one probe of your multimeter to each terminal of the heating element. It does not matter which probe goes to which terminal. Observe the reading on your multimeter's display. A functioning heating element should show a resistance reading between 8 and 15 ohms. If your multimeter is on the audible continuity setting, it should beep. If it shows "OL" (over limit), "infinite," or "1," this indicates no continuity, meaning the circuit is broken. This means the heating element is faulty. You can also apply similar troubleshooting methods if you find your [Maytag dryer is not heating up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-maytag-dryer-not-heating-up), as Maytag is a Whirlpool brand.

## Interpreting Multimeter Readings and Next Steps

Once you have performed the continuity test on your Whirlpool dryer heating element, you need to understand what the readings mean. This interpretation tells you the condition of the element. If your multimeter displayed a resistance value typically between 8 and 15 ohms (and it beeped on continuity mode), congratulations! Your heating element is likely working correctly. This means the "no heat" issue probably lies with another component.

However, if your multimeter displayed "OL," "infinite," "1," or simply did not beep on continuity mode, this indicates an open circuit. This means the electrical path within the heating element is broken. In simpler terms, the element has failed. It cannot heat up, and it needs to be replaced. This is a common cause for a dryer not heating.

If your heating element tested good, your troubleshooting is not over. You will need to inspect other components that control heat. This includes the thermal fuse, the high-limit thermostat, and the thermistor. These parts are usually located near the heating element assembly or along the dryer's exhaust path. Each of these can be tested for continuity with your multimeter in a similar fashion. If any of these also show an open circuit, they will also need replacement. Replacing a dryer heating element is a common repair, and you can find general guidance on how to replace a heating element in a dryer by looking at resources like how to replace a [Samsung dryer heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-heating-element-in-samsung-dryer-dv40j3000ew-a2), as the process has many similarities across brands.

## Beyond the Element: Other Reasons Your Dryer Won't Heat

While the heating element is a common cause for no heat, it is not the only one. If your Whirlpool dryer heating element tests good, you must check other components. This ensures you fix the actual problem. It helps avoid unnecessary repairs.

One of the most frequent culprits is a blown thermal fuse. This small, one-time-use safety device trips if the dryer overheats. A clogged vent is often the reason for overheating. If your thermal fuse has blown, it will show no continuity on a multimeter. You will need to clear the vent first, then replace the fuse. Regularly cleaning your dryer, including the vents, can prevent this issue. You can learn more about general maintenance by checking our guide on [how to clean a Whirlpool dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-whirlpool-dryer).

The high-limit thermostat is another safety feature. It acts like a resettable fuse, cycling power to the heating element to maintain proper temperature. If it fails, it can remain open, preventing heat. A faulty thermistor, a temperature sensor, can send incorrect signals to the control board, leading to no heat or insufficient heat. Lastly, issues with the main control board or even the timer can prevent the heating cycle from initiating. If you've exhausted all these checks and still have no heat, a professional might be needed. Many dryer problems, regardless of brand, share common symptoms; for instance, issues with an [LG dryer running but not heating](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dryer-running-but-not-heating) often involve similar diagnostics.
