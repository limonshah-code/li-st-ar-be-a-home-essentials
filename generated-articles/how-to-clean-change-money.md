## How to Clean Change Money: A Comprehensive Guide

Have you ever looked at your pocket change or a crumpled dollar bill and thought, "That looks incredibly dirty"? You are not alone. Money changes hands constantly. It picks up dirt, germs, and grime from countless sources. Many people wonder if it is possible to clean change money. They also wonder if cleaning money is a good idea. We often handle cash every day. Keeping it clean can feel like a good practice.

This guide explores effective methods to clean both coins and paper currency. We discuss the necessary tools. We also cover the potential risks involved. You will learn safe ways to refresh your money. This article helps you understand when to clean money and when to leave it alone. We aim to provide clear steps. This helps you make informed decisions about your currency.

### Takeaway

Cleaning change money can improve its appearance and remove surface dirt. Be careful, though. Harsh methods can damage currency. They can also reduce its value for collectors.
*   **Coins:** Use mild soap and water for general grime. Consider baking soda or vinegar for tough stains.
*   **Paper Money:** Gentle dabbing with a damp cloth is usually best. Avoid excessive moisture or scrubbing.
*   **Safety First:** Always prioritize the currency's integrity. Do not use abrasive materials. Do not try to clean rare or valuable items.

### How do you clean change money?

You can clean change money by gently washing coins with mild soap and water, or carefully dabbing paper money with a slightly damp cloth. Always avoid harsh chemicals or excessive scrubbing. This helps prevent damage to the currency. Drying money completely is also a vital step.

## Understanding Why You Might Clean Change Money

Money goes through many hands. It travels from person to person, place to place. This journey means it picks up a lot of things. Dirt, oils, and bacteria cling to coins and bills. Sometimes, the grime is visible. It makes the money look old and unappealing.

People often want to clean their money for a few reasons. One main reason is hygiene. We touch money and then we touch our faces or food. Cleaning money can give us peace of mind. It removes some of the surface contaminants. Another reason is appearance. A shiny coin or a crisp bill feels nicer to handle. It also looks better.

However, cleaning money is not always about hygiene. Collectors sometimes clean coins. They do this to reveal details or improve looks. This is usually a bad idea for valuable coins. Cleaning can strip away natural patina. This patina is part of a coin's history. It can reduce the coin's monetary value significantly. Our focus here is mainly on everyday currency. We aim to make it look and feel cleaner for daily use.

## Essential Tools and Materials for Cleaning Money

Cleaning money safely requires the right tools. You do not need many fancy items. Simple household products often work best. The key is to be gentle. Harsh chemicals or abrasive materials can damage currency. They can ruin it. Always gather your supplies before you begin.

For cleaning coins, you will need a few basic things. A soft cloth is essential. Microfiber cloths work very well. You also need mild soap. Dish soap is usually fine. Distilled water is better than tap water. Tap water has minerals. These minerals can leave spots on coins. Some methods use baking soda or white vinegar. These are good for stubborn dirt on coins. Never use steel wool or harsh brushes. They scratch the coin surface.

Paper money needs even more care. For this, a very lightly damp cloth is often enough. Distilled water is still recommended. Isopropyl alcohol can be used for spot cleaning. Use it sparingly. It dries quickly. Avoid using any strong cleaning solutions. Never put paper money in a washing machine. This destroys the bill. You also need a flat, clean surface for drying. I personally use paper towels for drying.

Here is a list of common materials:
*   Mild dish soap
*   Distilled water
*   Soft cloths (microfiber is ideal)
*   Cotton swabs or balls
*   Baking soda (for coins)
*   White vinegar (for coins)
*   Isopropyl alcohol (for very careful spot cleaning on paper money)
*   Paper towels
*   Small non-metallic bowls

Always choose the gentlest option first. Increase strength only if necessary. This minimizes the risk of damage.

## How to Clean Coins Safely and Effectively

Cleaning coins can bring back their luster. It also removes accumulated grime. The method you choose depends on the coin's condition. It also depends on its material. Most modern coins respond well to gentle cleaning. Remember, cleaning valuable or antique coins is generally discouraged. It can decrease their collector value.

### Basic Soap and Water Method

This is the safest method for most common coins. It works well for general dirt and grime. I always start here.

1.  **Separate Coins:** Sort your coins. Separate different metals if possible. This prevents discoloration.
2.  **Prepare Solution:** Fill a small bowl with warm distilled water. Add a few drops of mild dish soap.
3.  **Soak Coins:** Place the coins in the soapy water. Let them soak for 10-20 minutes. For heavily soiled coins, you can soak them longer. Sometimes, I let them sit for an hour.
4.  **Gentle Scrub:** Remove one coin at a time. Gently rub it with your fingers or a soft cloth. You can use a soft toothbrush for crevices. Be careful not to scratch the surface.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse each coin under clean, running distilled water. Ensure all soap residue is gone.
6.  **Dry Completely:** Pat the coins dry with a clean, soft cloth. Then, let them air dry on a paper towel. Ensure they are completely dry before storing. Any moisture can cause new tarnish.

### Tackling Tougher Stains with Vinegar or Baking Soda

For coins with stubborn tarnish or oxidized spots, stronger agents might be needed. Use these methods with caution. Only use them on non-collectible coins.

*   **Vinegar and Salt Bath (for copper/bronze coins):**
    1.  Mix 1/4 cup white vinegar with 1 teaspoon of table salt in a non-metallic bowl.
    2.  Place tarnished coins into the solution. Watch them closely. The tarnish should start to lift. This usually happens in a few minutes.
    3.  Remove coins once clean. Do not leave them too long.
    4.  Rinse thoroughly with distilled water. Dry completely.
*   **Baking Soda Paste (for silver/nickel coins):**
    1.  Make a paste using baking soda and a little distilled water. It should be thick.
    2.  Apply the paste to the coin. Gently rub with your fingers or a soft cloth.
    3.  Rinse well under distilled water.
    4.  Dry completely.

For more detailed information on specific coin types and their care, you can refer to resources on [How to Clean Coins](https://homeessentialsguide.com/clean-coins-how-to). Remember, aggressive scrubbing can damage the coin's surface. This can reduce its value or appeal. Always be gentle.

## How to Clean Paper Money Carefully

Cleaning paper money is much trickier than cleaning coins. Bills are made of a special fabric blend, not paper. This blend includes cotton and linen. Still, they are delicate. They can tear or lose their features easily. The goal here is usually light sanitization or removing minor surface dirt. Do not expect to make an old, crumpled bill look brand new.

### Gentle Wiping for Surface Dirt

For light dirt or dust, a simple wipe can be effective. This is the least invasive method. I always start with this.

1.  **Prepare a Damp Cloth:** Lightly dampen a clean, soft microfiber cloth with distilled water. Wring it out very well. The cloth should be barely moist.
2.  **Lay Flat:** Place the paper bill on a clean, flat surface. A cutting board or a clean table works well.
3.  **Gentle Wipe:** Very gently wipe the surface of the bill. Use light, even strokes. Do not press hard. Avoid scrubbing. You just want to pick up surface dirt.
4.  **Flip and Repeat:** Turn the bill over and repeat on the other side.
5.  **Air Dry:** Lay the bill flat on a clean paper towel. Let it air dry completely. Do not try to speed drying with heat. Heat can damage the bill or its security features.

### Spot Cleaning Techniques for Specific Stains

For small, specific spots like a tiny ink mark or a food stain, you can try targeted cleaning. This requires extreme caution.

*   **Alcohol for Ink Spots:** Dip a cotton swab in isopropyl alcohol. Gently dab the ink spot. Do not rub. Dab only the stained area. Alcohol evaporates quickly. This minimizes moisture damage. Be aware that this can spread the ink if not done right. It can also fade the original printing.
*   **Addressing Mild Mold or Mildew:** If you have bills with light mold, be very careful. Mold spores can spread. You can try to gently dab the affected area with a cotton swab dipped in a very diluted bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water). Or, use plain isopropyl alcohol. This is risky. Mold can be deeply embedded. Aggressive cleaning will likely destroy the bill. For mold, it is often safer to exchange the bill at a bank if possible. For comprehensive advice on this, you might consult resources like [How to Clean Moldy Money](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-moldy-money).

It is vital to understand the risks. Excess moisture can weaken the fibers of the bill. It can also cause the ink to run. Many security features, like watermarks or security threads, are delicate. They can be damaged by harsh cleaning.

Remember, paper money is not designed for washing. Treat it with extreme care.

## Dangers and Disadvantages of Cleaning Money

While cleaning money might seem appealing, it carries significant risks. Understanding these dangers is crucial. It helps you make an informed decision. Not all money should be cleaned. And not all cleaning methods are safe.

One major danger is **damaging the currency**. Paper bills are especially vulnerable. Too much water can make them brittle. It can cause ink to bleed. It can also destroy security features like watermarks or color-shifting ink. Once these features are gone, the bill might be deemed invalid. Coins, while more durable, can also be damaged. Abrasive cleaning can scratch their surfaces. It can remove fine details. This is irreversible damage.

Another key disadvantage is the **reduction of collector value**. This is especially true for coins. Professional numismatists (coin collectors) highly value a coin's original condition. This includes its natural patina. Patina is the green or brown layer that forms on copper or bronze coins over time. It is a protective layer. It indicates age and authenticity. Cleaning a coin removes this patina. It makes the coin look "new" but also less valuable to collectors. A cleaned coin is almost always worth less than an uncleaned one of the same grade. This applies even if it appears shinier.

There is also a legal aspect to consider. In many countries, **defacing currency is illegal**. While light cleaning for hygiene is generally not considered defacement, intentional alteration is. For example, trying to remove a stain by scrubbing so hard that you tear the bill or remove part of the design could cross a line. It is important to focus on surface dirt removal. Do not try to fundamentally change the currency's appearance.

Finally, cleaning money might not even be effective for hygiene. While you can remove some surface germs, money is porous. **It quickly picks up new contaminants.** The effort might not justify the risk, especially for paper bills. You might clean it today. It will be dirty again tomorrow.

## When Not to Clean Your Money

Knowing when *not* to clean your money is as important as knowing how to clean it. There are specific situations where cleaning is a bad idea. It can cause more harm than good. I always advise caution in these cases.

First, **never clean collector's items**. This includes rare coins, old bills, or anything you suspect might have numismatic value. As mentioned, cleaning significantly reduces collector value. Leave these items in their original state. If they are very dirty, consult a professional conservator. They can advise on proper preservation. They use methods that do not degrade the item's value.

Second, **avoid cleaning severely damaged or brittle currency**. If a bill is already torn, very thin, or crumbling, any attempt at cleaning will likely destroy it. Water will make it disintegrate. Even gentle handling can cause it to fall apart. For such bills, your best option is to take them to a bank. Banks often exchange severely damaged bills for new ones. They do this if enough of the original bill is identifiable.

Third, if currency has **deep, embedded stains** like grease, oil, or significant ink spills, cleaning is usually futile. These stains often penetrate the material. Surface cleaning will not remove them. Aggressive cleaning will only damage the currency further. It can also spread the stain. In these cases, it is often better to accept the stain. Or, you can exchange the bill at a bank if the stain impacts its usability.

Fourth, consider the immediate use of the money. If you plan to use the money in a **vending machine or for automated transactions**, cleaning might make it harder to read. Overly wet or warped bills can get stuck. Coins might lose features needed for machine recognition. In these instances, a dirty but intact piece of currency is more functional.

Finally, if you **lack the right tools or patience**, do not attempt to clean money. Rushing the process or using improvised, harsh tools will likely lead to damage. Cleaning money requires a gentle touch and careful drying. It is better to leave it dirty than to ruin it.

## Maintaining Cleanliness: Storing Your Change Money

Once you clean your change money, proper storage can help keep it cleaner for longer. This also helps preserve its condition. It prevents new dirt and damage. Good storage practices are simple. They do not require special equipment for everyday currency.

For **coins**, avoid leaving them loose in pockets or bags. This causes them to rub against each other. It leads to scratches and wear. Instead, use a coin purse. For larger quantities, dedicated coin tubes or albums are useful. These keep coins separated and protected. Make sure any storage material is made from inert plastic. PVC, for example, can damage coins over time. It releases chemicals that can react with the metal. Always store coins in a dry environment. Humidity is a major cause of tarnish and corrosion.

**Paper money** also benefits from careful storage. Avoid stuffing bills into tight wallets or pockets. This leads to creases and tears. Keep bills flat if possible. A well-designed wallet with enough space for bills is ideal. Store your wallet in a dry place. Do not leave bills exposed to direct sunlight for long periods. Sunlight can fade the ink. Like coins, paper money is sensitive to moisture. Keep it away from humid areas. A damp environment can cause mold growth.

If you handle a lot of cash, consider washing your hands frequently. This prevents transferring dirt and oils back onto your clean money. It is a good general hygiene practice anyway. By storing your money properly and handling it with care, you can maintain its cleanliness. This helps you avoid frequent cleaning. It also extends the life of your currency.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning Money

### Is it safe to clean all types of money?
It is not safe to clean all types of money. Modern circulation coins can usually be cleaned with mild methods. Paper money requires extreme care due to its delicate nature. Valuable or rare coins should never be cleaned by an amateur. Cleaning can permanently reduce their collector value.

### Can I use a washing machine to clean paper money?
No, you should never use a washing machine to clean paper money. The agitation and harsh detergents will destroy the bill. It will likely disintegrate or become unusable. Security features will be lost. The ink will run. Always use gentle, manual methods for paper currency.

### How do I dry money after cleaning it?
To dry money after cleaning, gently pat it with a soft, clean cloth or paper towel. Then, lay it flat on a clean, dry surface, like a paper towel or a drying rack. Allow it to air dry completely at room temperature. Do not use direct heat sources like hair dryers. Heat can damage the currency.

### Will cleaning coins make them more valuable?
No, cleaning coins almost always makes them less valuable to collectors. Cleaning removes the natural patina, which is part of a coin's historical integrity. This reduction in value applies even if the coin looks shinier. Collectors prefer coins in their original, uncleaned state.

### What should I do if my money is severely damaged or has a strong odor?
If your money is severely damaged, very moldy, or has a strong, persistent odor, it is best not to clean it yourself. Take it to a bank. Banks often exchange damaged or contaminated currency if enough of the bill is identifiable. This is safer than risking further damage.

### Can I sterilize money to remove all germs?
You can remove some surface germs and dirt from money with cleaning. However, completely sterilizing money is very difficult. Money is porous and can quickly pick up new microbes. Focus on gentle cleaning for hygiene, but understand it is not a sterile item. Regular hand washing is a more effective hygiene practice.
