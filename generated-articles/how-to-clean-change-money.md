## How to Clean Your Change Money Safely

Have you ever looked at the loose change in your pocket or purse and felt a little hesitant? Our coins pass through countless hands. They pick up dirt, grime, and germs. This makes them look dull and feel unhygienic. Understanding **how to clean change money** can transform your pocket full of dull coins. It makes them shiny and more pleasant to handle.

Cleaning your coins is not just about making them look better. It is also about basic hygiene. Imagine how many surfaces your coins touch. From cash registers to vending machines, they collect all sorts of things. This guide will walk you through simple and effective methods. We will cover basic washes to tackle tough grime. We will also discuss special care for different coin types. You will learn what to use and what to avoid. Let us make your change sparkle.

### Takeaway:
*   Sanitize coins for improved hygiene and appearance.
*   Use gentle cleaning methods to prevent damage to coin surfaces.
*   Separate coins by material (e.g., copper, silver) for optimal cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive tools to protect your coins.
*   Always rinse coins thoroughly and dry them completely after cleaning.

To clean change money, gently wash coins with mild soap and water, then scrub with a soft brush for grime. For tarnished coins, use a vinegar-salt solution or lemon juice. Always rinse thoroughly and dry completely to prevent new stains or damage.

## Why You Should Clean Your Change Money

Our money travels far and wide. It is one of the most frequently touched items in the world. This constant exchange means coins collect a surprising amount of dirt. They also pick up many microorganisms. Cleaning your change offers several important benefits. It goes beyond just making them look nice.

First, consider the hygiene aspect. Coins can harbor various bacteria and viruses. Think about all the public places they visit. Every hand they pass through leaves something behind. Regular cleaning helps reduce these germs. This makes handling your money a cleaner experience. It is a small step in promoting better personal hygiene.

Second, clean coins simply look better. A shiny coin feels newer and more substantial. Dull, grimy coins can feel unpleasant. They might even make you hesitant to use them. Cleaning restores their original luster. This enhances their visual appeal. It can even make your coin collection more enjoyable if you have one.

Third, removing grime can sometimes reveal hidden details. Old coins, especially, often have intricate designs. Dirt and tarnish can obscure these features. A careful cleaning can bring these details back into view. This allows you to appreciate the coin's artistry. You might discover something new about your old change. Sometimes, coins can even develop mold, which you can learn more about if you also handle paper currency. If you encounter moldy money, knowing [how to clean moldy money](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-moldy-money) is very helpful.

Finally, keeping coins clean helps preserve them. Accumulated dirt can, over time, react with the coin's metal. This can lead to corrosion or permanent staining. Regular, gentle cleaning prevents this build-up. It helps extend the life of your everyday currency. This ensures your money remains in good condition for longer.

## Basic Cleaning Methods for Everyday Coins

When you want to refresh your everyday change, simple methods work best. These techniques are easy to do at home. They remove general dirt and grime without being too harsh. You can use common household items to make your coins look new again.

A basic soap and water wash is your first line of defense. Gather your dirty coins. Fill a bowl with warm water and add a few drops of mild dish soap. Let the coins soak in this solution for about 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen any caked-on dirt. After soaking, gently scrub each coin. Use a soft toothbrush or a non-abrasive cloth. Focus on areas with visible grime. This physical action lifts away the loosened dirt.

For a slightly more powerful clean, an ultrasonic cleaner can be useful. These devices use sound waves to create tiny bubbles in a liquid. The bubbles then gently scrub the coins clean. They are great for reaching into small crevices. Simply place your coins in the cleaner with water and a tiny bit of soap. Run the machine for a few minutes. This method is effective for general cleaning and is very gentle.

Some people wonder about using a dishwasher. While technically possible, it is not recommended for coins. The harsh detergents and high heat can be too aggressive. They can damage the coin's surface or finish. Stick to hand-washing or an ultrasonic cleaner for safety. You might be surprised at what currency can withstand, but for best results, gentle methods are key.

After any wet cleaning, proper drying is crucial. Do not let coins air dry. This can leave water spots. Instead, lay them on a clean, soft towel. Gently pat them completely dry. You can also use a soft cloth to buff them slightly. This helps restore some shine. Ensure they are totally dry before storing them. Moisture can lead to new tarnish or corrosion.

## Tackle Tarnished Coins: Removing Oxidation and Grime

Sometimes, coins are more than just dirty. They might be tarnished. Tarnish is a thin layer of corrosion that forms on metal surfaces. It makes coins look dull, dark, or discolored. This happens when the metal reacts with air or other substances. Specialized methods are needed to remove this tarnish.

One popular and effective solution is a vinegar and salt bath. This mixture creates a mild acid that reacts with the tarnish. Take a small bowl and add about half a cup of white vinegar. Stir in a teaspoon of table salt until it dissolves. Place your tarnished coins into this solution. Let them soak for a few minutes. You should see the tarnish begin to lighten. Be careful not to leave them too long. This could harm the coin.

Lemon juice also works similarly to vinegar. Its citric acid is great for breaking down tarnish. You can combine lemon juice with a pinch of baking soda to form a paste. Apply this paste to the tarnished coin. Gently rub it with your fingers or a soft cloth. The baking soda provides a mild abrasive action. This helps lift the tarnish away. Rinse the coin thoroughly afterward.

For copper coins specifically, ketchup or cola can be surprisingly effective. The mild acids in these products work wonders on copper tarnish. Simply cover your copper coins in ketchup or submerge them in cola. Let them sit for 10-30 minutes. The acid will work to dissolve the dark oxidation. Rinse them well after treatment. The results can be quite striking.

Another common household item for tarnished coins is toothpaste. Choose a plain white toothpaste, not a gel or one with scrubbing beads. Apply a small dab to the coin. Rub it gently with a soft cloth or an old toothbrush. The mild abrasive in toothpaste helps polish away the tarnish. Rinse the coin completely under running water. This method can also make paper currency look better, especially if you know [how to clean paper money](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-paper-money). Remember, always test any new method on just one coin first. This ensures it gives the desired results without damage.

## Special Considerations for Different Coin Materials

Not all coins are made the same. Different metals react differently to cleaning agents. What works well for a copper penny might damage a silver dollar. Understanding your coin's material is key. This helps you choose the safest and most effective cleaning method. You want to restore their shine, not cause permanent harm.

Copper and bronze coins often develop a dark brown or green tarnish. This is due to oxidation. For these coins, mild acids are very effective. The vinegar and salt solution or lemon juice mentioned earlier works well. Ketchup or cola can also work wonders on copper. However, do not leave them in for too long. Excessive exposure to acid can strip away the natural patina. This patina is sometimes desired by collectors. Rinse these coins immediately and thoroughly after treatment.

Silver coins, like older dimes, quarters, or half-dollars, can turn black. This is silver sulfide tarnish. This tarnish can be removed with specific methods. A baking soda paste mixed with a little water is gentle. Apply it and rub lightly. Another method involves lining a glass bowl with aluminum foil. Add hot water, baking soda, and salt. Submerge the silver coins. An electrochemical reaction will transfer the tarnish to the foil. This method is often very effective.

Clad coins are modern coins, like current US quarters and dimes. They have layers of different metals. For example, a copper core with nickel-copper outer layers. These coins generally respond well to mild soap and water. You can also use vinegar-based solutions cautiously. Avoid very strong acids or harsh abrasives. These can damage the outer layer. This damage can make the inner copper core visible.

Gold coins are much less prone to tarnish. Gold is a very stable metal. Most gold coins only need a simple wash. Use warm water and a tiny bit of mild dish soap. Gently wipe them with a soft cloth. Gold is also a softer metal. Avoid any scrubbing that could scratch its surface. Always be extra careful with any valuable gold pieces. Knowing the metal helps you decide on the best approach for each piece of change.

## What to Avoid When Cleaning Change Money

While cleaning change can be satisfying, some methods do more harm than good. Using the wrong products or techniques can permanently damage your coins. This is especially true for any coins that might have collector value. Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to do. Your goal is to clean, not to destroy.

First, stay away from harsh chemicals. Products like bleach, ammonia, or strong industrial cleaners are too aggressive. They can react negatively with the coin's metal. This can cause discoloration, pitting, or irreversible damage. These chemicals might clean the coin quickly. However, they will also degrade its surface. The coin will look unnatural or damaged.

Second, never use abrasive materials or tools. Steel wool, coarse sandpaper, or even stiff-bristled brushes are too rough. They will scratch the coin's surface. These scratches are permanent. They destroy the fine details of the coin's design. This drastically reduces its aesthetic appeal. It also diminishes any potential collector value. Always opt for soft cloths or a soft toothbrush.

Third, avoid aggressive scrubbing or polishing. Even with soft materials, excessive force can be damaging. It can wear down the coin's relief. This makes the design look flat and less defined. Over-polishing can also give coins an unnatural, "cleaned" look. This is often undesirable to collectors. Gentle rubbing is usually enough.

Fourth, do not attempt to clean valuable collector coins. Coins with significant numismatic value should never be cleaned by an amateur. Cleaning can drastically reduce a coin's value. Collectors and experts prefer coins in their original condition. Even a professionally "cleaned" valuable coin usually sells for less. If you suspect a coin has value, consult a professional numismatist. They can advise on preservation.

Finally, avoid prolonged soaking in any solution. Even mild solutions, like vinegar, can become corrosive over time. They can etch the coin's surface or cause uneven toning. Always monitor coins closely during soaking. Remove them as soon as the desired effect is achieved. Rinse them thoroughly immediately after.

## Safety Precautions and Best Practices

Cleaning coins is a straightforward task. However, taking a few safety precautions is wise. These steps protect both you and your coins. Following best practices ensures effective cleaning. It also helps prevent any accidental damage or harm. Always approach coin cleaning with care and common sense.

Always wear gloves, especially when using cleaning solutions. Even mild acids like vinegar or lemon juice can irritate your skin. Disposable rubber or latex gloves offer good protection. They also prevent natural oils from your hands from transferring to the coins. Fingerprints can leave new marks. Good ventilation is also important. If you are using anything stronger than soap and water, work in a well-ventilated area. This avoids inhaling fumes.

Before cleaning a batch of coins, test your chosen method. Pick one less valuable coin first. Apply the cleaning solution or technique to this single coin. Observe the results. Does it clean effectively? Does it cause any discoloration or damage? This test coin acts as a safeguard. It helps you avoid ruining an entire batch of change. Only proceed with the rest of your coins if the test is successful.

Thorough rinsing is a critical step after any wet cleaning. Residue from cleaning solutions can continue to react with the metal. This causes new tarnish or damage over time. Rinse each coin individually under running water. Ensure all traces of soap or acid are gone. A final rinse in distilled water can help prevent water spots.

Drying coins completely is equally important. Water left on coins can lead to new tarnish. It can also cause mineral deposits or water spots. After rinsing, place coins on a soft, absorbent cloth. Gently pat them dry. You can also use a soft microfiber towel to buff them. Make sure there is no moisture before storing them. Proper drying ensures the coins retain their newfound cleanliness.

Finally, store your cleaned coins properly. Keep them in a dry place. You can use coin tubes or small plastic bags. This protects them from humidity and dust. Avoid storing them in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. These conditions can accelerate tarnish. Following these guidelines helps keep your change looking great for longer.

## Maintaining Currency Hygiene Beyond Cleaning

Cleaning your change is a great step. But maintaining overall currency hygiene involves more than just occasional washes. It is about integrating good habits into your daily life. This helps keep all your money cleaner, both coins and paper. A proactive approach is always better than reacting to extreme dirt.

One simple habit is washing your hands after handling money. Think of money as another public surface you touch. Just as you wash your hands after touching a doorknob, do the same after counting bills or coins. This is the easiest way to prevent germ spread. It also keeps your hands clean before you touch food or your face. This small act makes a big difference.

Consider regular cleaning schedules for your everyday change. You do not need to clean every single coin every week. However, periodically gathering your loose change for a quick wash helps. Maybe once a month or every few months. This prevents heavy build-up of dirt and grime. It keeps your coins in a consistently cleaner state. This makes future cleaning easier.

Proper storage of your money also plays a role. Avoid stuffing coins into tight, dirty pockets where they can accumulate lint. Instead, use a clean coin purse or a designated tray. This keeps them somewhat separated from other items. It also minimizes exposure to dirt and oils. Storing paper money flat in a wallet helps keep bills crisp. It prevents them from getting excessively crumpled or dirty.

Be mindful of where you place your money. Do not leave coins or bills directly on dirty surfaces. For example, avoid placing them on a dusty counter or a wet table. This prevents immediate contamination. A little attention to where your money rests can go a long way. This helps reduce the need for intensive cleaning later.

Educating yourself and others about currency hygiene is also helpful. Many people do not realize how much bacteria money carries. Sharing these simple tips can benefit everyone. A collective effort helps maintain cleaner currency for all. These small, consistent efforts create a healthier environment. They contribute to a more pleasant handling of money every day.
