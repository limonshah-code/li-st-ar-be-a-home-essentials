### Takeaway

A blocked dishwasher salt compartment reduces cleaning efficiency. Use these key steps to restore your dishwasher's performance:

## Understanding Dishwasher Salt and Its Importance

Dishwasher salt is not the same as table salt. It is a coarse-grain sodium chloride specifically designed for dishwashers. This salt helps the water softener unit inside your dishwasher work. Many areas have hard water. Hard water contains high levels of minerals like calcium and magnesium. These minerals leave spots on dishes and can build up inside your appliance.

The dishwasher's water softener unit removes these minerals from the water. It uses resin beads that attract the minerals. Over time, these resin beads become full. Dishwasher salt helps "regenerate" these beads. This means the salt cleans the beads, allowing them to remove more minerals. If the salt compartment is blocked, the regeneration process fails. This leads to hard water issues and less effective cleaning. Understanding what dishwasher salt is for helps you appreciate its role in getting clean dishes. Using the right type of salt ensures your dishwasher runs smoothly.

It also causes limescale buildup inside the dishwasher. This buildup can harm internal components over time.

## Common Causes of Dishwasher Salt Blockages

Salt blockages in a dishwasher dispenser happen for several reasons. Understanding these causes helps you prevent them. The salt compartment is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher, often under the lower rack. It has a screw-on cap. When salt hardens here, it forms a solid mass. This mass prevents new salt from dissolving and reaching the water softener.

One common reason is **moisture getting into the compartment**. This can happen if the cap is not sealed tightly after refilling. Even a small gap lets
