### Understanding Your Cream Area Rug: Materials and Vulnerabilities

Cream area rugs are beautiful. Their light color can make dirt and stains very visible. Knowing your rug's material helps you clean it properly. Different fibers react differently to cleaning products. I have learned this through experience.

#### Common Cream Rug Materials

Area rugs come in various materials. Each type needs specific care. Wool rugs are durable but can shrink with hot water. Synthetics like polypropylene resist stains but can flatten over time. Cotton rugs are soft but absorb spills quickly. Silk rugs are luxurious but require professional cleaning. Jute and sisal are natural fibers; they need very little moisture.
