It also adds a unique story to their outfits. The "naked dress" trend, which reveals more skin, continues its influence. However, it often comes with intricate embroidery or delicate lace. This adds sophistication to the bold style.

Accessories play a big part. Statement jewelry, particularly large necklaces and sparkling earrings, completes many looks. Unique handbags, often custom-made, also catch the eye. The choice of footwear is crucial, with many opting for sleek, high heels. It is fascinating to see how each star interprets these trends. They add their own personal touch.
