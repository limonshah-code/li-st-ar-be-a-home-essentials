## Do Samsung Dishwashers Include a Power Cord for Installation?

Getting a new appliance for your home is exciting. You unbox it, ready to set it up, but then a question hits you: "Does my Samsung dishwasher come with a power cord?" Many people ask this exact question. It is a common point of confusion for new dishwasher owners. I certainly remember wondering the same thing when I first installed a dishwasher. This article helps you understand how Samsung dishwashers typically connect to power. We will look at why some appliances do not include a cord. We will also cover your options for connecting your dishwasher. This guide provides steps for proper installation, ensuring your appliance works safely.

When you purchase a new Samsung dishwasher, it generally does not include a power cord. Manufacturers typically design dishwashers for either direct hardwiring into your home's electrical system or connection via a separate, purchased power cord kit. This design choice helps meet various electrical codes and installation preferences. You will need to plan for one of these connection methods.

## Do Samsung Dishwashers Come With a Power Cord? The Direct Answer

You just got your new Samsung dishwasher. You open the box with anticipation. Then you look for the power cord. I have seen this situation many times. Most Samsung dishwashers do not come with a power cord in the box. This fact often surprises new buyers.

The dishwasher comes ready for connection. It has a junction box at the back. This box allows for two main types of electrical hookup. You can either hardwire it directly. Or you can attach a specific power cord kit.

This practice is common across the appliance industry. It is not unique to Samsung. Many brands, like LG or GE, follow this same model. Knowing this helps you prepare for installation. You can then get the correct parts you need. This prevents delays on installation day.

## Why Dishwashers Are Often Sold Without a Power Cord

You might wonder why a large appliance like a dishwasher does not include a power cord. This decision is not random. Manufacturers have good reasons for this. These reasons involve safety, electrical codes, and installation flexibility. I will explain these points simply.

First, electrical codes vary by region. What is standard in one city might not be in another. Some local codes require dishwashers to be hardwired. Hardwiring means connecting the appliance directly to your home's electrical system. There is no plug. This creates a permanent connection. It helps prevent accidental unplugging or improper use. Hardwiring is often seen as safer in certain situations. It reduces the number of connections that could loosen over time.

Second, hardwiring is a common practice for dishwashers. Many homes already have a dedicated circuit for the dishwasher. This circuit usually ends in an electrical box inside the cabinet. The dishwasher connects directly to this box. Installing a plug on an appliance that will be hardwired anyway adds unnecessary cost. Manufacturers avoid this extra cost. They pass the savings on to you. It also means less waste if the plug is never used.

Third, flexibility matters. Some people prefer hardwiring for a cleaner look. Others want the option of a plug. Offering the dishwasher without a cord allows for both. You choose the method that suits your home and local rules. You can then buy the specific kit or parts needed. This gives you control over the installation process. It also ensures compliance with diverse building standards.

This industry standard applies to many appliance types. For instance, [Does a Dishwasher Come With a Power Cord](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-a-dishwasher-come-with-a-power-cord) discusses this general practice. Understanding this helps you prepare better. It makes your installation smooth and compliant.

## Hardwiring Your Samsung Dishwasher vs. Using a Power Cord Kit

When you install your new Samsung dishwasher, you face a choice. You can hardwire it. Or you can use a power cord kit. Both methods connect the appliance to electricity. However, they have different steps and requirements. I find it helpful to understand both options clearly.

Hardwiring means connecting the dishwasher's wires directly to your home's electrical supply. This connection happens inside a junction box. This box is usually behind or next to the dishwasher. You will see three wires coming from the dishwasher: black (hot), white (neutral), and green (ground). These wires connect to corresponding wires from your home's electrical circuit. This creates a permanent electrical connection. It has no visible plug. Many local codes prefer or require this method. It offers a secure, permanent power source. This method might require more comfort with electrical work. If you hardwire, you do not need to buy a separate power cord.

Using a power cord kit involves attaching a specific cord to the dishwasher's junction box. This cord then plugs into a standard electrical outlet. This outlet must be a dedicated 15-amp, 120-volt grounded receptacle. The cord has three prongs, matching standard outlets. This option is popular for its simplicity. You can easily unplug the dishwasher if needed. This is often the case if you rent or plan to move the appliance later. You must buy a UL-listed dishwasher power cord kit. Samsung sells specific kits. Generic options are also available. Ensure it is rated for dishwashers and the correct voltage.

The choice often depends on your home's setup. It also depends on local electrical codes. Some homes may only have hardwire connections available. Others might have an outlet ready for a plug. Always check your dishwasher's manual for specific instructions. You should also verify local codes. If you are unsure, professional help is a good idea.

## Selecting the Correct Power Cord for Your Samsung Dishwasher

If you decide to use a power cord, choosing the right one is important. You cannot use just any cord lying around. A dishwasher power cord must meet specific safety and electrical standards. I always make sure to pick the right one. This ensures safe operation and proper function.

First, always look for a UL-listed power cord. UL stands for Underwriters Laboratories. This organization tests products for safety. A UL listing means the cord meets strict safety standards. Using a non-UL-listed cord can be a fire hazard. It can also void your appliance warranty. Most appliance stores and hardware stores carry UL-listed cords.

Second, check the cord's gauge and length. The gauge refers to the wire thickness. A lower gauge number means a thicker wire. Thicker wires can handle more current. Dishwashers need a 16-gauge or 14-gauge cord. A 16-gauge cord is often sufficient for dishwashers. However, a 14-gauge cord offers extra capacity and safety. The cord length should be appropriate for your setup. It should reach the outlet without stretching. Most dishwasher cords are 5-6 feet long. Avoid using extension cords. Extension cords are not safe for dishwashers.

Third, ensure the cord has the correct connector for your dishwasher. Samsung dishwashers often use a specific type of connector that attaches to the internal junction box. Samsung sells specific power cord kits for their dishwashers. These kits are guaranteed to fit and meet all necessary specifications. Using a manufacturer-approved kit simplifies installation. It also reduces compatibility issues. You can find these kits at appliance retailers or online.

Before buying, confirm the voltage and amperage requirements of your Samsung dishwasher. This information is in your appliance manual. It is also on the rating plate inside the dishwasher door. Most dishwashers use a 120-volt, 15-amp circuit. The power cord must match these requirements. Choosing the correct power cord is a simple step. It is crucial for a safe and functional dishwasher installation.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Installing a Power Cord on Your Samsung Dishwasher

Installing a power cord on your Samsung dishwasher is a task you can do. However, it requires care and attention to safety. I always emphasize safety first when dealing with electricity. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a correct and safe installation.

### Before You Start: Safety First

1.  **Turn Off Power:** Locate the circuit breaker for your kitchen or the dishwasher. Flip it to the "OFF" position. This is the most crucial step. Use a voltage tester to confirm the power is off at the outlet or junction box.
2.  **Gather Tools:** You will need a screwdriver (Phillips and flathead), wire strippers, wire nuts, and electrical tape. Ensure your power cord kit is ready.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Access the Junction Box:** Pull the dishwasher out from under the counter. It might be helpful to tilt it back gently. Locate the electrical junction box on the front underside of the dishwasher. It is usually a small metal box. Remove its cover plate.
2.  **Connect the Strain Relief:** The power cord kit includes a strain relief clamp. This clamp secures the power cord to the dishwasher. It prevents the cord from being pulled out of the junction box. Feed the power cord through the strain relief and into the junction box opening. Tighten the strain relief screws to secure the cord.
3.  **Wire Connections:**
    *   **Ground Wire (Green or Bare Copper):** Connect the green or bare copper wire from the power cord to the green ground screw inside the junction box. Tighten it firmly.
    *   **Neutral Wire (White):** Connect the white wire from the power cord to the white wire from the dishwasher using a wire nut. Twist the wire nut clockwise until it is tight. Pull gently on the wires to ensure a secure connection.
    *   **Hot Wire (Black):** Connect the black wire from the power cord to the black wire from the dishwasher using another wire nut. Twist it clockwise until tight.
4.  **Secure Wires and Close Box:** Tuck the connected wires neatly inside the junction box. Ensure no bare wire is exposed outside the wire nuts. Replace the junction box cover plate. Secure it with its screws.
5.  **Position and Test:** Carefully slide the dishwasher back into its place. Plug the power cord into the dedicated grounded outlet. Turn the power back on at the circuit breaker. Run a short cycle on the dishwasher to test its function. Check for any leaks or unusual noises.

Remember, if you are not comfortable with electrical work, it is best to call a qualified electrician. Improper wiring can cause fire or electric shock.

## When to Call a Professional for Dishwasher Installation

Installing a Samsung dishwasher, especially the electrical connection, can be a DIY project. However, there are times when calling a professional is the smartest and safest choice. I always recommend professional help if you have any doubts. It provides peace of mind and prevents serious problems.

One key reason to hire a professional is if you are uncomfortable with electrical work. Working with electricity carries risks. These risks include electric shock or fire hazards. If you do not understand wiring diagrams or feel uncertain about any step, stop. A licensed electrician or appliance installer has the knowledge and tools. They ensure the connection is safe and correct. They understand proper wire sizing, grounding, and circuit requirements.

Another reason relates to local electrical codes. These codes vary by city and state. They specify how appliances must be installed. A professional installer knows these codes. They ensure your dishwasher installation complies with all local regulations. Non-compliant installations can lead to safety issues. They can also cause problems during home inspections. They might even void your home insurance in case of an electrical fault.

Furthermore, a professional installation can protect your warranty. While installing a power cord yourself generally does not void a warranty, improper installation can. If an issue arises from faulty wiring, Samsung may not cover the repair. A professional installer takes responsibility for their work. Many offer guarantees on their services. This protects you if something goes wrong.

Finally, consider the overall complexity. Installing a dishwasher involves more than just the electrical hookup. It also includes water supply, drain lines, leveling, and securing the unit. If your under-sink area is cramped or difficult to access, a professional can navigate these challenges efficiently. They often complete the job faster and without complications. Investing in professional installation is a small price to pay for safety, compliance, and proper function.

## Common Misconceptions About Dishwasher Power Connections

Many myths surround dishwasher power connections. Understanding these helps you avoid mistakes. I have heard many of these misconceptions myself. Let us clear up some common ones.

First, a common belief is that all dishwashers come with a standard plug. As we discussed, this is false for Samsung and most major brands. This expectation can cause delays on installation day. Always confirm what is included before your appliance arrives. Plan to purchase a power cord kit separately if you need one.

Second, some people think any household extension cord works for a dishwasher. This is a dangerous misconception. Dishwashers draw a significant amount of power. Standard extension cords are not designed for this. They can overheat, melt, or cause fires. You should never use an extension cord with a dishwasher. Always connect the dishwasher directly to a dedicated wall outlet or hardwire it.

Third, there is a myth that you can hardwire a dishwasher without turning off the circuit breaker. This is extremely dangerous. Working with live electricity can cause severe electric shock or death. Always turn off the power at the breaker before touching any wires. Verify the power is off with a voltage tester. Safety must be your top priority during any electrical work.

Fourth, some believe a dishwasher's electrical connection is simple, like plugging in a lamp. Dishwashers need a dedicated electrical circuit. This means the dishwasher is the only appliance on that circuit. Sharing a circuit with other high-power appliances can overload it. This causes breakers to trip. It can also create fire hazards. Ensure your home has a dedicated 15-amp or 20-amp circuit for the dishwasher.

Knowing these facts helps you approach your Samsung dishwasher installation correctly. It keeps you safe. It also ensures your appliance works as expected. Always consult your appliance manual. When in doubt, call a qualified professional.
