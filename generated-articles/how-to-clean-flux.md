## Effectively Clean Flux from Electronics & Circuit Boards

Have you ever finished a soldering project only to find sticky, discolored residue left behind? This is flux, and knowing **how to clean flux** properly is vital for the longevity and performance of your electronic components. Flux is a chemical agent used in soldering to clean metal surfaces, promoting better solder flow and stronger electrical connections. However, if left on circuit boards, this residue can cause significant problems. It can become corrosive, attract moisture, and even lead to electrical shorts over time.

Ignoring flux residue is a common mistake that can degrade your work. Proper cleanup improves circuit reliability, enhances aesthetic appeal, and allows for easier inspection of solder joints. I will explain the different types of
