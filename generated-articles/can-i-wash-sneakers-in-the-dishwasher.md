## Washing Sneakers in the Dishwasher: What You Need to Know

Dirty sneakers are a common problem for many people. We wear them daily, and they collect dirt, grime, and odors. You might wonder about quick cleaning solutions. One idea that often comes up is using your dishwasher. This appliance washes dishes effectively. So, can it wash your sneakers too? I will explore this question. This guide covers how to wash sneakers in the dishwasher, its risks, and better options. You will learn the best ways to keep your footwear clean.

### Takeaway

*   **Avoid most sneakers:** Do not wash delicate, leather, suede, or embellished sneakers in the dishwasher.
*   **Use cold water:** Hot water can damage shoe materials and glues.
*   **No detergent:** Dishwasher detergents are too harsh for shoes.
*   **Air dry always:** Heat from the dishwasher or dryer causes shrinkage and damage.
*   **Consider alternatives:** A washing machine or hand washing are generally safer choices.

### The Direct Answer

Yes, you can wash certain types of sneakers in the dishwasher. However, this method is not ideal for all shoes. You must use cold water and no harsh detergents. This approach helps avoid damage to the shoes and your appliance.

## Is Washing Sneakers in the Dishwasher a Good Idea?

Many people consider the dishwasher for cleaning dirty sneakers. It seems like an easy solution. You load the machine, press a button, and wait. However, this method carries risks. Dishwashers use high heat and strong detergents. These elements clean plates and cutlery well. They can be very damaging to your footwear. Understanding these risks is important before you try this cleaning method.

When you wash sneakers in the dishwasher, you expose them to extreme conditions. High temperatures can melt shoe glues. This causes parts to separate. Hot water also shrinks some materials. This changes the shoe's fit and comfort. Strong dishwasher detergents contain harsh chemicals. These chemicals strip away colors and damage fabrics. They can also leave residues on your shoes. This causes skin irritation. I have found that careful consideration is key here.

You also risk damaging your dishwasher. Dirt and debris from shoes can clog the filter. This affects the machine's performance. It can also lead to costly repairs. Odors from dirty shoes might transfer to your dishes. This creates an unpleasant experience. Many experts recommend avoiding this method. They suggest gentler cleaning options. Your sneakers will last longer with proper care.

Sometimes, for specific types of durable, synthetic sneakers, a dishwasher might seem like an option. But even then, you must use a cold, rinse-only cycle. Avoid all heating elements and harsh soaps. This minimizes damage. Still, better and safer cleaning methods exist. We will explore those in later sections.

## Dishwasher vs. Washing Machine: Which Is Better for Sneakers?

When cleaning dirty sneakers, people often compare the dishwasher to the washing machine. Both appliances use water to clean. However, they operate differently. These differences matter significantly for shoe care. The washing machine is generally a safer and more effective choice for most sneakers. I find that understanding these differences helps you choose wisely.

A washing machine uses cooler water temperatures. It offers gentle cycles. These cycles are designed for fabrics. You can also use mild laundry detergents. These detergents are safe for shoe materials. They do not contain the harsh chemicals found in dishwasher detergents. Many washing machines also have options like a "delicate" or "hand wash" cycle. These settings protect your shoes from damage. You can easily wash multiple pairs at once. This makes it efficient. Discover how to wash sneakers in a washing machine effectively: [How to wash sneakers in machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-sneakers-in-machine).

Dishwashers, in contrast, are built for tough stains on hard surfaces. They use very hot water, sometimes exceeding 150°F (65°C). This heat can ruin shoe glues and synthetic materials. Dishwasher jets spray water with high pressure. This pressure can distort sneaker shapes. The detergents are highly abrasive. They remove food particles and grease. These chemicals are too strong for fabrics and delicate shoe parts. I often warn against their use for shoes.

While you might try to use a "rinse only" or "cold wash" setting on a dishwasher, it still lacks the specific features for fabric care. The design of a dishwasher's racks is also not ideal for securing shoes. They can move around. This causes damage to the shoes and the appliance. For most athletic shoes and fabric sneakers, the washing machine provides a gentler, more controlled, and safer cleaning environment.

## Preparing Your Sneakers for a Dishwasher Wash

If you decide to wash sneakers in the dishwasher, proper preparation is vital. This step minimizes potential damage to your shoes and the appliance. Skipping these steps increases risks. I always stress the importance of pre-cleaning. This makes the dishwasher method less harmful.

First, remove laces and insoles from your sneakers. Laces can tangle in the dishwasher's spray arms. They might also get damaged. Insoles often absorb a lot of moisture. They might not dry properly. They can also get damaged by the water pressure. You should clean laces and insoles separately. You can hand wash laces with mild soap. Allow insoles to air dry. This prevents odor and mildew.

Next, remove loose dirt and debris from the shoes. Use a dry brush or an old toothbrush. Scrape off any caked-on mud or dirt. This prevents these particles from clogging your dishwasher's filter. This pre-cleaning also makes the dishwasher wash more effective. It tackles the embedded grime. I always take a few minutes for this.

Rinse the shoes under cold running water. This removes surface dirt. It also prepares the material for the wash cycle. You want to get rid of as much loose grit as possible. This step protects your dishwasher from dirt accumulation. It ensures better cleaning results.

Finally, place your sneakers securely in the dishwasher. Use the top rack only. This keeps them away from the heating element at the bottom. The top rack also receives less direct, forceful spray. You can use a mesh laundry bag to hold the shoes. This prevents them from moving around during the cycle. This step keeps both your shoes and your dishwasher safe.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Wash Sneakers in the Dishwasher

Washing sneakers in the dishwasher requires a specific approach. Following these steps helps protect your shoes and your appliance. This guide provides a detailed process. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Remember, this method is still not recommended for all types of sneakers.

1.  **Prepare Your Sneakers:**
    *   Remove laces and insoles. Clean them by hand.
    *   Brush off loose dirt, mud, and debris from the outside of the shoes.
    *   Rinse the sneakers under cold water to remove surface grime.
    *   For a deeper clean before the dishwasher, you may pre-treat specific stains. You can find useful tips for this here: [How to clean sneakers in dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-sneakers-in-dishwasher).

2.  **Load the Dishwasher:**
    *   Place the prepared sneakers on the top rack of your dishwasher.
    *   Ensure they are secure. You can use a mesh laundry bag. This keeps them from moving and hitting the spray arms.
    *   Do not place shoes on the bottom rack. The heating element and stronger spray can cause damage.
    *   Wash sneakers by themselves. Do not mix them with dishes. This avoids food residue transfer and keeps your dishwasher cleaner.

3.  **Choose the Right Cycle:**
    *   Select a "rinse only" cycle if your dishwasher has one. This uses only water.
    *   If not, choose the coldest water setting available.
    *   **Crucially, turn off the heated dry cycle.** High heat melts glues and shrinks materials.
    *   Do not add any dishwasher detergent. Dishwasher detergents are too strong for shoes. They can cause damage and leave residue.

4.  **Run the Cycle:**
    *   Start the dishwasher. Let it complete the chosen cycle.
    *   Monitor the shoes if possible. Ensure they stay in place.

5.  **Remove and Air Dry:**
    *   Once the cycle finishes, immediately remove your sneakers.
    *   Inspect them for any damage.
    *   Proceed to dry them properly. Air drying is essential. We will cover this next. Proper drying prevents mold and bad smells.

## Materials and Models: Which Sneakers Can Go in the Dishwasher?

Not all sneakers are suitable for a dishwasher wash. The type of material dictates if this method is safe. Understanding material compatibility is very important. Putting the wrong shoes in the dishwasher causes permanent damage. I always advise caution here.

**Dishwasher-Friendly Materials (with extreme caution):**

*   **Synthetic Mesh and Canvas:** Shoes made primarily of synthetic mesh, canvas, or basic synthetic fabric uppers might tolerate a cold dishwasher rinse. Think simple athletic shoes or basic canvas sneakers. These materials are generally durable. They resist shrinking better than natural fibers.
*   **Rubber Soles:** Most rubber soles can withstand water. However, the high heat of a dishwasher's drying cycle still poses a risk to the glue that binds them to the upper shoe.

**Sneakers to *Never* Wash in the Dishwasher:**

*   **Leather and Suede:** These materials are highly sensitive to water and heat. They will crack, shrink, and get discolored. They also lose their natural oils. For leather sneakers, specialized cleaning methods are required: [How to clean leather sneakers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leather-sneakers).
*   **Delicate Fabrics:** Silk, satin, or other delicate materials will fray or lose their shape. They are not built for machine washing of any kind.
*   **Embellished or Designer Sneakers:** Shoes with sequins, beads, embroidery, or other decorative elements will get damaged. These components often detach or lose their shine. Designer brands often use delicate materials and construction methods. For example, specific guidance exists for high-end brands: [Can you wash Gucci sneakers in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-gucci-sneakers-in-washing-machine).
*   **Shoes with Gel Inserts or Air Bubbles:** The heat can damage gel components or deflate air cushions. This ruins the shoe's comfort and support.
*   **Hand-Painted or Dyed Shoes:** The harsh water pressure and cold cycle can strip away paint or dyes. This leaves your shoes looking dull or uneven.
*   **Vintage Sneakers:** Older shoes often have brittle glues and delicate materials. These are highly susceptible to damage from any machine washing.
*   **Platform or Wedge Sneakers:** The thick soles might hide delicate adhesives that cannot stand up to the dishwasher environment.

Always check the shoe's care label if it has one. When in doubt, hand washing or a washing machine on a delicate cycle is usually a safer alternative for most sneakers. This helps maintain their quality and longevity. Even for seemingly durable sneakers, the risk of glue failure from dishwasher use is present.

## The Don'ts of Dishwasher Shoe Cleaning

While some people attempt to wash sneakers in the dishwasher, certain practices must be avoided. These "don'ts" are critical. They prevent damage to your shoes and your appliance. I cannot stress these points enough. Ignoring them leads to costly mistakes.

*   **Don't Use Dishwasher Detergent:** This is the most important rule. Dishwasher detergents are powerful. They contain corrosive chemicals and abrasive agents. These are designed for tough food stains, not delicate shoe fabrics. Using them will strip color, degrade materials, and potentially leave chemical residue that irritates your skin. Always skip detergent for shoes.
*   **Don't Use Hot Water Cycles:** High temperatures are destructive to most shoe materials. Hot water can melt the adhesives that hold your sneakers together. This causes delamination, where soles separate from the uppers. It also causes synthetic and natural fibers to shrink or distort. Always opt for the coldest setting or a rinse-only cycle.
*   **Don't Use the Heated Dry Cycle:** The extreme heat from a dishwasher's drying cycle will warp, shrink, and crack your sneakers. It will also compromise any remaining glues. Always turn off the heated dry function. Remove your shoes immediately after the wash cycle. Air drying is the only safe method for shoes after any wash. For more details on safe washing, you can consult guides like: [How to clean sneakers in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-sneakers-in-washing-machine).
*   **Don't Put Delicate or Leather Shoes in:** As discussed, leather, suede, silk, and heavily embellished shoes are not suitable for any machine wash, including the dishwasher. They require specialized, gentle cleaning by hand.
*   **Don't Mix Shoes with Dishes:** This poses hygiene risks. Dirt, bacteria, and odors from shoes can transfer to your plates and cutlery. It is also unsanitary for the shoes. Always wash shoes in a dedicated cycle.
*   **Don't Overload the Dishwasher:** Giving shoes enough space ensures proper cleaning and prevents them from banging against each other or the dishwasher interior. Overloading can prevent water from reaching all surfaces.
*   **Don't Use the Bottom Rack:** The bottom rack of a dishwasher is closer to the heating element and receives stronger water jets. This increases the risk of damage. Always place shoes on the top rack.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you reduce the risks associated with dishwasher shoe cleaning. It helps maintain the lifespan of your sneakers. Your dishwasher also stays in good working order.

## Drying Your Sneakers Safely After Washing

Proper drying is as important as the washing process. Incorrect drying can ruin your sneakers. It can cause shrinkage, cracking, and odor. Never use high heat to dry your shoes. This applies whether you washed them in a dishwasher or a washing machine. I always follow specific air-drying steps.

The best method for drying sneakers is always air drying. This process takes time, but it protects your shoes. High heat from dryers or direct sunlight damages shoe materials. It weakens glues and causes material breakdown. Patience is a key factor here.

Here's how to air dry your sneakers safely:

1.  **Remove Excess Water:** Gently blot your sneakers with a clean, dry towel. This removes surface moisture. Do not wring or twist the shoes. This distorts their shape.
2.  **Stuff with Paper Towels or Newspaper:** Crumple plain white paper towels or newspaper. Stuff them inside your sneakers. This absorbs internal moisture. It also helps maintain the shoe's shape as it dries. Change the paper every few hours. This speeds up the drying process. Avoid colored newspaper ink. It can transfer to your shoes.
3.  **Place in a Well-Ventilated Area:** Position your sneakers in a spot with good airflow. A shaded outdoor area or indoors near a fan works well. Avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade colors and crack materials.
4.  **Allow Ample Drying Time:** Sneakers can take 24-48 hours to dry completely. Thicker shoes might take longer. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them. Wearing damp shoes causes odors and mildew.
5.  **Use a Shoe Dryer (Optional):** Some specialized shoe dryers use gentle, low heat or just airflow. These can accelerate drying safely. Make sure they are designed for shoes and use minimal heat.

Never put your sneakers in a clothes dryer. The tumbling and high heat will cause irreversible damage. Your shoes will shrink, become brittle, or fall apart. Always prioritize air drying to extend the life of your footwear.

## Alternatives to Dishwasher Cleaning for Sneakers

While the dishwasher might seem like a shortcut, safer and more effective methods exist for cleaning sneakers. These alternatives protect your footwear. They also achieve better results. I always recommend these methods first.

### Hand Washing for Delicate or Specialty Sneakers

Hand washing is the gentlest method for sneakers. It is ideal for delicate materials like leather, suede, or embellished shoes. It is also perfect for shoes you want to keep in pristine condition.

*   **Gather Supplies:** You need a soft brush, mild soap (dish soap or laundry detergent), warm water, and a clean cloth.
*   **Pre-Clean:** Remove laces and insoles. Brush off loose dirt.
*   **Spot Clean:** Dip your brush in soapy water. Gently scrub soiled areas.
*   **Wipe and Rinse:** Use a damp cloth to wipe away soap residue. Do not submerge leather or suede.
*   **Air Dry:** Stuff with paper. Air dry in a well-ventilated area.

This method allows for precise cleaning. It targets specific stains. It also protects delicate materials.

### Washing Machine for Durable Sneakers

For most athletic sneakers, canvas shoes, and synthetic fabric shoes, a washing machine is a good option. It is more efficient than hand washing. It is also much safer than a dishwasher.

*   **Prepare Shoes:** Remove laces and insoles. Brush off loose dirt. Place shoes in a mesh laundry bag. This protects them and the machine.
*   **Use Cold Water:** Always select a cold water cycle.
*   **Gentle Cycle:** Choose a delicate, gentle, or hand wash cycle.
*   **Mild Detergent:** Use a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid powder detergents. They can leave residue.
*   **No Heat Dry:** Turn off the heated dry option.
*   **Air Dry:** Remove immediately and air dry thoroughly.
You can find comprehensive instructions for this method here: [How to wash sneakers in machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-sneakers-in-machine).

### Spot Cleaning for Minor Dirt and Stains

Sometimes, your sneakers only have small marks. Spot cleaning is perfect for these situations. It saves time and prevents unnecessary wear.

*   **Quick Wipe:** Use a damp cloth with a little mild soap. Wipe visible dirt away.
*   **Eraser:** A magic eraser can remove scuffs from rubber soles.
*   **Shoe Cleaner Kits:** Many brands offer specific cleaning solutions for sneakers. Follow their instructions.

These alternative methods ensure your sneakers stay clean and last longer. They prevent the risks associated with dishwasher cleaning. Always choose the method that best suits your shoe's material and condition.
