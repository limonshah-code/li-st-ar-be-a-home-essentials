### Takeaway

*   Always disconnect power before starting any repair.
*   Use a multimeter to perform continuity and resistance tests.
*   A good heating element shows continuity and specific resistance (10-30 ohms).
*   No continuity or an "OL" reading means the element is bad.
*   Consider checking the thermostat and thermal fuse if the element tests good.

### Clear and Concise Answer to Main Query

To test a Whirlpool dishwasher heating element, disconnect power, locate the element at the tub's bottom, and access its terminals. Use a multimeter to check for continuity and measure resistance (ohms). A working element shows continuity and typically 10-30 ohms; no continuity or an "OL" reading means it needs replacement.

## Recognizing Symptoms of a Faulty Whirlool Dishwasher Heating Element

Your dishwasher has one job: clean dishes thoroughly. If your Whirlpool dishwasher leaves dishes cold or wet, a problem exists. One common culprit is the heating element. Knowing the signs helps you diagnose issues faster.

The heating element ensures hot water during the wash cycle and helps dry dishes. When it fails, these important functions stop working. You will notice immediate changes in your dishwasher's performance. Catching these symptoms early guides your repair efforts.

### Common Signs Your Heating Element May Be Bad

Several clear signs point to a heating element problem. Pay attention to how your dishwasher finishes its cycle. These clues can save you time during troubleshooting. I have listed the most frequent ones for you.

*   **Dishes are not dry:** This is perhaps the most obvious sign. The heating element gets hot during the drying cycle. It evaporates water from the dishes. If your dishes are still wet after a full cycle, the element might not be working.
*   **Water is not hot:** Feel the water inside the dishwasher during a wash cycle. If it feels lukewarm or cold, the element is failing to heat the water. Hot water is important for effective cleaning and sanitizing.

*   **Error codes:** Some modern Whirlpool dishwashers show error codes on the display. Check your owner's manual for specific codes related to heating issues. These codes are a direct signal from the dishwasher's internal diagnostics.
*   **Excessive cycle time:** If the dishwasher runs much longer than normal, it might be trying hard to reach the set temperature. A faulty heating element struggles to heat water, making the machine extend the wash or dry cycle. This can waste energy and time.

These symptoms do not always mean the heating element is the only problem. Other components, like the thermostat or control board, can also cause similar issues. However, the heating element is a good place to start your check. Once you confirm the symptoms, you can prepare to test the component directly.

## Essential Tools and Safety Precautions for Testing

Before you begin any diagnostic work, you need the right tools. More importantly, you must prioritize safety. Working with electrical appliances carries risks. Following safety steps protects you from injury.

Gathering your tools beforehand makes the process smoother. You will avoid interruptions and complete the test more quickly. I always make sure everything is ready before I even touch the appliance. This keeps me focused and safe.

### Key Tools You Will Need

You likely have most of these tools at home. If not, they are easy to find at any hardware store. Investing in a good multimeter is a smart choice for any DIY appliance repair. This device is very versatile.

*   **Multimeter:** This is the most crucial tool. You will use it to check for continuity and measure resistance. Make sure it has an ohm (Ω) setting. Digital multimeters are easier to read for beginners.
*   **Screwdrivers:** You will need both Phillips and flathead screwdrivers. These help remove access panels and secure connections.
*   **Pliers:** Pliers can help with stubborn wire connectors or fasteners. Keep a pair handy just in case.
*   **Flashlight or Headlamp:** The inside of a dishwasher can be dark. A flashlight helps you see clearly, especially when working in tight spaces.
*   **Work Gloves:** Protecting your hands from sharp edges or grime is important. Sturdy work gloves are a good idea.

### Crucial Safety Precautions

Electrical repairs demand extreme caution. Never skip these steps. Your safety is more important than any repair. I cannot stress this enough – always be careful.

1.  **Disconnect Power:** This is the most vital step. Unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet. If it is hardwired, turn off the circuit breaker that supplies power to the dishwasher. Confirm the power is off before touching any wires.
2.  **Wear Protective Gear:** Use work gloves to protect your hands. Safety glasses are also recommended to protect your eyes from debris.
3.  **Allow Cooling Time:** If the dishwasher just finished a cycle, the heating element might be hot. Let it cool completely before touching it. This prevents burns.
4.  **Work in a Well-Lit Area:** Good lighting helps you see what you are doing. It reduces the chance of making mistakes or damaging components.
5.  **Follow Manufacturer Guidelines:** Always refer to your Whirlpool dishwasher's owner's manual or service manual. These provide specific instructions and warnings for your model.
6.  **Do Not Force Parts:** If a part feels stuck, do not force it. You could break it. Look for hidden screws, clips, or specific release mechanisms.

Taking these precautions seriously will help ensure a safe and successful repair. You will feel more confident knowing you have minimized risks. Now, let's move on to accessing the heating element itself.

## Accessing the Whirlpool Dishwasher Heating Element

Before you can test the heating element, you need to reach it. The heating element in most Whirlpool dishwashers sits at the bottom of the wash tub. It is designed to be accessible for service. This step involves carefully removing a few internal components.

This part of the process requires some gentle handling. You do not want to damage other parts while trying to reach the heating element. I find it helpful to take pictures as I go along. This helps me remember how everything fits back together.

### Locating the Heating Element

The heating element is usually a U-shaped or circular metal rod. It is visible once you open the dishwasher door and look inside the tub. You will see it positioned near the bottom, often encircling the main wash arm assembly.

*   **Open the Dishwasher Door:** Start by fully opening the dishwasher door.
*   **Locate the Bottom Rack:** The heating element is below the lower dish rack. You will need to remove this rack first.
*   **Identify the Element:** Look for the metal rod at the very bottom of the tub. It will have two electrical terminals at the back, underneath the dishwasher.

### Steps to Reach the Element's Terminals

To test the element properly, you need to access its electrical terminals. These are typically located on the underside of the dishwasher. You might not even need to fully remove the element to test it. This can save time and effort. For an idea of whether you can test without removing, consider this resource: [Can You Test a Dishwasher Heating Element Without Removing?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-test-a-dishwasher-heating-element-without-removing)

1.  **Remove the Lower Dish Rack:** Pull the lower rack out completely and set it aside.
2.  **Remove the Lower Spray Arm:** The spray arm usually just lifts off its central post. Some models may require unscrewing a nut or cap.
3.  **Remove Filters/Filter Assembly:** Most Whirlpool dishwashers have a filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. This might include a coarse filter and a fine micro-filter. Twist or lift these out according to your manual.
4.  **Tilt or Slide Out the Dishwasher:** To reach the terminals, you will need to access the underside of the appliance.
    *   **Option A (Easier):** If there is enough slack in the water and drain lines, you can carefully tilt the dishwasher back. Prop it up securely on sturdy blocks or have someone help hold it.
    *   **Option B (More Involved):** You may need to remove the screws holding the dishwasher to the countertop. Then, carefully slide the dishwasher out from under the counter. Be gentle with water lines and drain hoses.
5.  **Remove the Bottom Access Panel:** Once you can access the underside, look for a metal access panel. This panel protects the electrical components. Unscrew the retaining screws and remove the panel.
6.  **Locate the Heating Element Terminals:** The heating element has two electrical terminals. These are usually metal prongs with wires connected to them. They will be visible once the access panel is off. Disconnect the wires from the terminals. You may need pliers for this. Be sure to note which wire connects to which terminal, or take a picture.

With the terminals exposed and wires disconnected, you are ready to perform the tests. Remember to keep all removed parts in a safe place. You will reinstall them after your testing is complete.

## Performing a Continuity Test on the Heating Element

Now that you have accessed the heating element terminals, it is time to use your multimeter. The first test we will perform is a continuity test. This test tells you if there is an unbroken electrical path through the heating element. If the path is broken, the element cannot heat.

A continuity test is like checking if a bridge is intact. If the bridge is out, nothing can cross. Similarly, if the heating element lacks continuity, electricity cannot flow through it. This means the element is faulty.

### Understanding Continuity

Continuity means that electricity can flow from one point to another. For a heating element, this means the internal coil is complete and not broken. If the coil is broken, the circuit is "open," and electricity cannot pass through it to generate heat.

### Steps for a Multimeter Continuity Test

This is a straightforward test. Your multimeter makes it easy to get a clear answer. Follow these steps carefully to ensure an accurate reading. I always double-check my multimeter settings before touching the probes to the terminals.

1.  **Set Your Multimeter:** Turn your multimeter's dial to the continuity setting. This is often indicated by a speaker symbol or an ohm symbol (Ω). On some meters, it might be part of a resistance range.
2.  **Calibrate (Optional but Good Practice):** Touch the two multimeter probes together. The meter should beep (if it has an audible function) and show a reading of zero or very close to zero ohms. This confirms your meter is working correctly.
3.  **Place Probes on Terminals:** Touch one multimeter probe to each of the two heating element terminals. Make sure the probes make good contact with the metal. Do not let the probes touch any other metal parts of the dishwasher.
4.  **Observe the Reading:**
    *   **Good Heating Element:** Your multimeter should beep (if applicable) and show a reading of zero or a very low number of ohms (typically less than 1 ohm for continuity). This indicates that the electrical path through the element is complete.
    *   **Bad Heating Element:** If the multimeter does *not* beep and displays "OL" (Open Line or Over Limit), "INF" (Infinity), or a very high number, the heating element has an open circuit. This means the element is broken and needs replacement.

A successful continuity test only tells you if the element is complete. It does not tell you if it is heating efficiently. For that, you need to check the resistance. However, a failed continuity test is a definite sign of a bad element. If you want to learn more about similar testing procedures, this guide on [How To Test a KitchenAid Dishwasher Heating Element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-kitchenaid-dishwasher-heating-element) might be helpful, as the process is quite similar across brands.

## Checking Resistance (Ohms) of the Heating Element

The continuity test tells us if the element is broken. Now, checking the resistance (ohms) tells us more about its electrical health. Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electric current. Each heating element has a specific resistance value. This value is important for generating the right amount of heat.

If the resistance is too high, not enough current flows, and the element won't heat properly. If it is too low, too much current could flow, potentially causing other issues. A proper resistance reading confirms the element is likely to heat correctly.

### What Resistance Indicates

Resistance directly relates to how much heat the element can produce. Heating elements are designed to have a specific resistance. This design allows them to safely draw a certain amount of current and convert electrical energy into heat. When the resistance falls outside the expected range, the element will not function as intended.

### Steps for Measuring Resistance (Ohms)

Measuring resistance is similar to checking continuity, but you will focus on a specific numerical value. This value helps confirm if your Whirlpool heating element is within its normal operating parameters. Make sure your hands are steady and the probes make firm contact.

1.  **Set Your Multimeter:** Turn your multimeter's dial to the ohms (Ω) setting. Choose a range that you expect your reading to fall into. For most dishwasher heating elements, a 200-ohm or 2K-ohm (2000-ohm) range is appropriate. If you start with a lower range and get "OL," switch to a higher range.
2.  **Calibrate (Optional):** Touch the two multimeter probes together. The meter should read zero or very close to zero ohms. This step confirms the meter is working properly and accounts for any internal resistance.
3.  **Place Probes on Terminals:** Touch one multimeter probe to each of the two heating element terminals. Ensure you have good metal-to-metal contact. Do not let the probes touch other metal parts of the dishwasher.
4.  **Observe the Reading:**
    *   **Expected Range for Whirlpool:** A healthy Whirlpool dishwasher heating element typically reads between **10 to 30 ohms**. The exact value can vary by model. You can often find the specific resistance rating in your dishwasher's service manual or by checking the element's specifications online.
    *   **Interpreting Readings:**
        *   **Within Range (10-30 ohms):** If your reading falls within this range, the heating element's resistance is good. This suggests the element is electrically sound.
        *   **"OL" or Infinite Resistance:** This indicates an open circuit, meaning the element is broken. It will not heat. This confirms a faulty element, matching a failed continuity test.
        *   **Very Low Resistance (Close to 0 ohms, but not continuity):** While some continuity is near 0, if the resistance reading is very low (e.g., 1-5 ohms) and outside the specified range, it might indicate a short circuit within the element. This can cause the element to draw too much current or fail to heat correctly.
        *   **Very High Resistance (Above 30 ohms):** An unusually high resistance value means the element will not draw enough current to heat properly. It is likely faulty.

If your resistance reading is outside the 10-30 ohm range, or if you received an "OL" reading during the continuity test, the heating element is bad. It needs replacement.

## Inspecting Other Components: Thermostat and Thermal Fuse

Sometimes, your Whirlpool dishwasher's heating element might test perfectly fine. However, your dishes are still cold or wet. This tells us the problem lies elsewhere. Other components often work closely with the heating element. They can cause similar heating issues if they fail.

It is wise to check these related parts before deciding on a new heating element. This ensures you fix the actual problem. I have found many times that a simple thermal fuse causes a heating element to appear "dead." Taking a few extra minutes to check these parts can save you from replacing a perfectly good heating element.

### The Role of the Thermostat

The thermostat monitors and controls the water temperature inside the dishwasher. It tells the heating element when to turn on and off. This ensures the water reaches the correct temperature for effective cleaning and sanitization.

*   **Location:** The thermostat is typically mounted to the bottom of the wash tub, often near the heating element. It usually looks like a small, flat disc with two wires connected to it.
*   **How to Test:** To test the thermostat, you will use your multimeter in continuity mode.
    1.  Disconnect the wires from the thermostat terminals.
    2.  Place one multimeter probe on each terminal.
    3.  A working thermostat should show continuity (a beep and/or a reading near 0 ohms).
    4.  If it shows "OL" or no continuity, the thermostat is faulty and needs replacement. This means it is stuck in an open position, preventing power from reaching the heating element.

### The Function of the Thermal Fuse

The thermal fuse is a safety device. It is designed to blow (open) if the temperature inside the dishwasher gets too high. This prevents overheating and potential fire hazards. When the thermal fuse blows, it cuts power to the heating element. This makes the element stop working.

*   **Location:** The thermal fuse is usually located near the heating element or on the control board housing. It is a small component, often encased in a plastic housing.
*   **How to Test:** Testing a thermal fuse is also done with a multimeter in continuity mode.
    1.  Disconnect the wires from the thermal fuse.
    2.  Place one multimeter probe on each terminal of the fuse.
    3.  A good thermal fuse will show continuity (a beep and/or a reading near 0 ohms).
    4.  If it shows "OL" or no continuity, the thermal fuse has blown. It needs to be replaced. Remember, a blown thermal fuse indicates an underlying issue that caused the overheating. You should investigate what caused it to trip. This might involve checking the circulation pump or main control board if the heating element is fine.

Both the thermostat and thermal fuse are crucial to the heating system. Their failure mimics a faulty heating element. Always check these components if your heating element tests good. Understanding these related parts helps you correctly diagnose your Whirlpool dishwasher heating issues. You might find related information about replacing elements in guides like [How To Replace Heating Element on Whirlpool Dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-heating-element-on-whirlpool-dishwasher), as these components are often accessed during the same process.

## Troubleshooting and Next Steps Based on Test Results

You have completed the tests on your Whirlpool dishwasher's heating element, thermostat, and thermal fuse. Now it is time to interpret your results. This will guide you on what to do next. Knowing the outcome helps you make an informed decision.

Identifying the specific faulty component saves you time and money. Do not replace parts without confirming they are actually broken. I always make sure to double-check my readings before ordering any new parts. This approach prevents unnecessary expenses.

### If the Heating Element is Faulty

If your continuity test showed "OL" or infinite resistance, or your ohms reading was outside the 10-30 ohm range, the heating element is bad. It cannot be repaired; it must be replaced.

*   **Order a New Heating Element:** Make sure to purchase a genuine Whirlpool replacement part. Provide your dishwasher's model number to ensure compatibility. You can usually find the model number inside the dishwasher door frame.
*   **Installation:** Installing a new heating element is a straightforward process. It is essentially the reverse of removal. Ensure proper connections and sealing.
