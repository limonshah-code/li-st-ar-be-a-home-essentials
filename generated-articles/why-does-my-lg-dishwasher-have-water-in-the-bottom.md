### Clear Answer to Your Query

Your LG dishwasher has standing water in the bottom primarily due to a drainage problem. This issue often stems from a clogged filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, a malfunctioning drain pump, or problems with the air gap or garbage disposal connection. Addressing these common culprits usually resolves the drainage failure.

## Understanding a Clogged Dishwasher Filter

A clogged filter is the most frequent reason for water staying in your LG dishwasher. The filter catches food particles. It prevents them from re-entering the wash system. Over time, these particles build up. They block water from draining. This makes your dishwasher unable to finish its cycle correctly.

Most LG dishwashers have a multi-part filter system. This system is located at the bottom of the tub. It usually consists of a coarse filter and a fine filter. Both need regular cleaning. If you see food debris or grime in the water, a dirty filter is likely the cause. My own LG dishwasher needed this type of maintenance once. Cleaning it solved the problem immediately.

### How to Clean Your LG Dishwasher Filter

Cleaning the filter is a simple task. You do not need special tools. I recommend doing this monthly. If you run your dishwasher often, clean it more frequently.

1.  **Locate the Filter:** Open the dishwasher door. Pull out the lower dish rack. You will see the filter assembly at the bottom center.
2.  **Remove the Filter:** Twist the cylindrical filter counter-clockwise. Lift it out. Some models may have an additional fine mesh filter underneath. Remove this one too.
3.  **Clean the Filter:** Rinse both parts under warm running water. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away any food debris. You can also use a small amount of dish soap. Make sure all holes are clear. If it is really dirty, soak it in warm, soapy water for a few minutes. This helps loosen stubborn grime.
4.  **Reinstall the Filter:** Place the fine mesh filter back first. Then insert the cylindrical filter. Twist it clockwise until it locks into place. Make sure it is secure. A loose filter can allow debris into the pump.

Regular filter cleaning prevents many drainage issues. It also helps your dishwasher clean dishes better. A clean filter ensures proper water flow. This helps your appliance work efficiently. Keeping your dishwasher clean is vital for its longevity. For general cleaning tips, you can also look at how to maintain other LG appliances, like your washing machine.

## Checking Your Dishwasher Drain Hose for Obstructions

After the filter, the drain hose is the next place to check for blockages. The drain hose carries dirty water from your dishwasher to the sink drain or garbage disposal. If this hose is blocked or kinked, water cannot exit. This leaves standing water in the tub. I have seen many cases where a simple kink was the culprit.

Drain hoses can get clogged with various things. Food particles that bypass the filter are common culprits. Grease buildup can also narrow the hose. Sometimes, the hose can become accidentally bent or pinched. This restricts water flow. This can happen if the dishwasher shifts slightly after installation.

### Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose

This inspection requires pulling the dishwasher out slightly. Be careful not to damage the floor. Before you start, disconnect power to the dishwasher. Turn off the circuit breaker for safety.

1.  **Locate the Drain Hose:** The drain hose connects to the back of the dishwasher. It then runs to your sink drain or garbage disposal unit. It is usually a flexible corrugated hose.
2.  **Check for Kinks:** Visually inspect the entire length of the hose. Look for any sharp bends or crimps. Straighten any kinks you find. If the hose is permanently bent, it may need replacement.
3.  **Disconnect the Hose (Optional but Recommended):** Place a shallow pan under the hose connections. Use pliers to loosen the clamps. Carefully disconnect the hose from both the dishwasher and the sink/disposal. Expect some water to spill out.
4.  **Clear Blockages:** Look inside the hose for blockages. You can use a long, flexible brush. A plumbers' snake can also work. Push it through the hose to dislodge any debris. You can also try flushing the hose with water from a garden hose. Make sure water flows freely through it.
5.  **Reattach the Hose:** Reconnect the hose securely at both ends. Ensure the clamps are tight. Avoid creating new kinks during reinstallation. The hose should have a high loop. This prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher.

A blocked drain hose is a very common reason for a dishwasher not draining. Many dishwasher drainage problems stem from this.

## Issues with the Dishwasher Drain Pump or Impeller

If the filter and drain hose are clear, the drain pump might be the problem. The drain pump is a vital component. It is responsible for forcibly expelling water from the dishwasher. When the cycle ends, the control board activates this pump. It pushes the dirty water out through the drain hose. A failing pump means water stays in the tub.

Signs of a bad drain pump vary. You might hear a humming noise but no water movement. Sometimes, you hear no sound at all during the drain cycle. The pump may also have a damaged impeller. The impeller is like a small fan inside the pump. It pushes water. If the impeller breaks or gets jammed, the pump cannot move water.

### Diagnosing and Addressing Drain Pump Problems

This step is more involved. It often requires some disassembly. Always disconnect power first.

1.  **Listen for the Pump:** Start a drain cycle. Listen closely for sounds from the bottom of the dishwasher. A functioning pump makes a distinct whirring sound. If you hear nothing, or only a weak hum, the pump is suspect.
2.  **Access the Drain Pump:** The drain pump is usually located under the dishwasher tub. You may need to remove the lower access panel or tilt the appliance. Refer to your LG dishwasher's service manual for exact instructions. Some pumps are accessed from the front. Others require pulling the dishwasher out.
3.  **Inspect the Impeller:** Once you access the pump, look for any foreign objects. Small pieces of glass, plastic, or even cherry pits can jam the impeller. Carefully remove any obstructions. Use pliers if necessary.
4.  **Check for Continuity:** If no obvious blockage exists, the pump motor itself might be faulty. You can use a multimeter to test for continuity. Consult your dishwasher's wiring diagram for the correct terminals. If there is no continuity, the pump is dead. It needs replacement.
5.  **Professional Help:** Replacing a drain pump can be complex. It involves electrical connections and proper sealing. If you are not comfortable with this repair, call a qualified appliance technician. They have the right tools and expertise. I usually recommend professional help for motor issues.

A faulty drain pump is a common mechanical failure. It directly prevents your LG dishwasher from draining. It is a critical component for water removal.

## Air Gap or Garbage Disposal Problems Affecting Dishwasher Drainage

The way your dishwasher connects to your home's drain system matters. An air gap or garbage disposal can cause drainage issues. Many homes have an air gap. This small cylinder is on top of your sink. It prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into your dishwasher. Your dishwasher drain hose connects to it. If this air gap gets clogged, water cannot drain properly.

If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, the disposal itself can be the problem. Food waste can build up. This blocks the dishwasher drain line inside the disposal. A common mistake occurs during new installations. A knockout plug inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet may not be removed. This plug must be removed for the dishwasher to drain.

### Troubleshooting Air Gap and Garbage Disposal Connections

These checks are relatively simple. They can save you a service call.

1.  **Check the Air Gap:**
    *   Look for a small, usually chrome, cylinder on your sink counter.
    *   Remove its cover. It usually twists off.
    *   Inspect inside for any food debris or blockages.
    *   Clean out any buildup you find. You can use a thin wire or a pipe cleaner.
    *   Check the hoses connected to the air gap. Make sure they are clear. One hose comes from the dishwasher. The other goes to the drain or disposal.
2.  **Inspect the Garbage Disposal Connection:**
    *   First, ensure the garbage disposal is empty. Run it for a minute with cold water.
    *   If you recently installed a new garbage disposal, check for the knockout plug. This is a small plastic piece inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet. It must be removed before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. If you did not remove it, the dishwasher cannot drain.
    *   Check the disposal inlet port. It is usually on the side of the disposal unit. Make sure it is not clogged with old food. Use a screwdriver or small stick to clear any debris.
    *   Always run your garbage disposal before starting the dishwasher. This clears any food in the drain path.

These external connections are often overlooked. They play a significant role in proper dishwasher drainage. If your GE dishwasher has standing water after a cycle, similar issues with the disposal or air gap can be the cause.

## Faulty Dishwasher Drain Valve or Solenoid

A drain valve regulates water flow. It opens to let water out and closes to hold water in. Many dishwashers, including some LG models, use a drain valve. This valve is often controlled by a solenoid. The solenoid is an electromagnet. When energized, it opens the valve. If the valve or solenoid fails, water cannot exit the dishwasher.

A faulty drain valve can stick closed. This prevents drainage. A broken solenoid cannot activate the valve. You might hear a clicking sound but no water movement if the solenoid is trying to work. This issue is less common than a clogged filter or hose. However, it is a possible cause for water in the bottom of your LG dishwasher.

### Troubleshooting the Drain Valve and Solenoid

Accessing these parts often requires significant disassembly. This may be a job for a professional. Always disconnect power first.

1.  **Locate the Drain Valve/Solenoid:** The drain valve is typically near the drain pump. It is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher tub assembly. Consult your LG dishwasher's service manual for its exact location.
2.  **Inspect for Obstructions:** Sometimes, small debris can get lodged in the valve itself. This prevents it from closing or opening fully. Carefully inspect and remove any foreign objects.
3.  **Test the Solenoid:**
    *   Use a multimeter to test for continuity across the solenoid's terminals.
    *   A good solenoid should show a specific resistance reading. This reading varies by model.
    *   No continuity, or an open circuit, means the solenoid is bad. It needs replacement.
    *   You can also apply direct voltage to the solenoid (if you know the correct voltage and how to do it safely). It should click or move when power is applied.
4.  **Check Valve Movement:** If you can manually move the valve mechanism, check for smooth operation. A sticky or seized valve will not open.
5.  **Replacement:** If the solenoid or valve is faulty, replacement is usually the only option. These parts are often sold as an assembly. This repair can be complex. It involves working with plumbing and electrical components. Consider calling a certified LG technician.

A malfunctioning drain valve or its solenoid will prevent water from draining. This leaves standing water in your appliance. It is a more advanced repair.

## Other Less Common Causes of Standing Water

While filter, hose, pump, and air gap issues cover most cases, other problems can cause water to pool in your LG dishwasher. These are less frequent but still possible. Understanding them helps in comprehensive troubleshooting. These issues may also require professional assistance.

### Overfilling Due to a Faulty Water Inlet Valve or Float Switch

Sometimes, the problem is not drainage but too much water entering the machine. If your dishwasher overfills, the excess water can remain after the cycle.

*   **Water Inlet Valve:** This valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. If it sticks open or leaks, too much water enters the tub. You might notice your dishwasher filling continuously, even when it should stop. [A similar issue can occur with washing machines if the water inlet valve is faulty.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-washing-machine-keep-filling-up-with-water)
*   **Float Switch:** The float switch is a safety device. It prevents overfilling. A small float rises with the water level. When water reaches a certain point, the switch tells the control board to stop filling. If the float is stuck or the switch is faulty, the dishwasher may overfill. You might see the float stuck down.

### Sump Assembly Issues

The sump assembly collects water at the bottom of the dishwasher. It houses the filter, drain pump, and sometimes the heating element.

*   **Cracked Sump:** A crack in the sump can cause slow leaks. This does not necessarily leave standing water in the bottom. However, it can indicate a broader issue with the assembly's integrity.
*   **Debris in Sump:** If large debris bypasses the filter, it can sit in the sump. This might obstruct the pump intake.

### Check Valve Problems

Some dishwashers have a check valve. This small component prevents drained water from flowing back into the dishwasher tub.

*   **Stuck Check Valve:** If the check valve gets stuck open, dirty water can backflow into the dishwasher. This leaves water in the bottom even after a successful drain cycle. This often results in dirty, gritty water. The check valve is typically located near the drain pump or in the drain hose connection.

### Control Board or Software Glitches

In rare cases, the electronic control board can malfunction. It might fail to send the correct signals to the drain pump or drain valve.

*   **Electronic Malfunction:** The control board is the brain of your dishwasher. If it is faulty, it might not initiate the drain cycle. This is less common than mechanical failures. Diagnosing a bad control board is difficult without specialized tools. Replacing it is expensive.

These less common issues usually require an appliance repair professional. They have the diagnostic tools and experience to pinpoint such problems accurately.

## Preventative Maintenance for Your LG Dishwasher

Regular maintenance can prevent many of the issues that cause standing water. My own experience shows that a little care goes a long way. This also extends the life of your appliance. Here are simple steps to keep your LG dishwasher draining perfectly.

### Essential Maintenance Tips

Follow these practices to avoid future drainage problems:

*   **Clean the Filter Regularly:** This is the single most important step. Aim for once a month. If you wash heavily soiled dishes often, clean it every two weeks. A clean filter prevents food particle buildup in the drain system.
*   **Scrape Plates Before Loading:** Remove large food scraps, bones, and seeds from dishes. This reduces the load on your dishwasher's filter. It helps prevent clogs. You do not need to pre-rinse perfectly, but scraping is essential.
*   **Use Proper Dishwasher Detergent:** Use high-quality detergent. Avoid using too much. Excess detergent can create too many suds. These suds can block the drain system. They can also leave residue. Using the correct type of detergent is important for any dishwasher, including LG models.
*   **Run Hot Water Before Starting:** Before running your dishwasher, turn on the hot water tap at your kitchen sink. Let it run for a minute. This ensures hot water fills the dishwasher from the start. Hot water helps dissolve grease. It improves cleaning and drainage.
*   **Clean the Interior:** Periodically run an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner. You can also use a cup of white vinegar placed on the top rack. This helps remove grease buildup and hard water deposits. These deposits can hinder drainage over time.
*   **Run Your Garbage Disposal Regularly:** If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, run the disposal before each dishwasher cycle. This clears any food waste. It ensures the drain line is clear for dishwasher discharge.
*   **Check the Drain Hose Annually:** Briefly inspect the drain hose for kinks or signs of wear. Make sure it maintains its high loop. This is usually done behind the dishwasher.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Do not pack dishes too tightly. Overloading can block spray arms. It can also prevent water from draining properly from the tub. Proper loading allows water to circulate and drain effectively.

By following these preventative maintenance tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of finding water in the bottom of your LG dishwasher. These simple habits contribute to your appliance's optimal performance and longevity.
