## How to Safely Drain a Broken Washing Machine

Waking up to a washing machine full of stagnant water is a frustrating start to any day. When your washing machine stops mid-cycle and won't drain, it creates an immediate problem. You need to remove the water to prevent spills and damage. Learning how to safely drain a broken washing machine is a crucial skill for any homeowner.

This guide helps you understand the steps involved in safely draining a washing machine that has stopped working. We cover safety precautions, common reasons for drainage issues, and methods to get the water out. You will learn about accessing the drain pump filter and using the drain hose. We also discuss when it is time to call a professional for help.

### Takeaway:
*   Always unplug the washing machine before starting any draining process.
*   Locate and use the drain pump filter or the main drain hose to remove water.
*   Prepare towels and buckets to manage water spills effectively.
*   Identify potential causes like clogs or pump failures after draining the machine.
*   Consider professional help if you cannot drain the machine or fix the issue yourself.

### How do you drain a broken washing machine?

To drain a broken washing machine, first unplug it to ensure safety. Locate the drain pump filter at the bottom front or back of the machine and slowly open it over a shallow pan to collect water. Alternatively, lower the machine's main drain hose into a bucket to allow gravity to empty the drum.

## Safety First: Essential Precautions Before Draining

Before you attempt to drain a washing machine, your safety is paramount. Water and electricity are a dangerous combination. Always disconnect the power supply to the machine first. This prevents electrical shock hazards.

Next, prepare your workspace. You should have plenty of towels and shallow containers ready. A wet-dry vacuum can also be very helpful for collecting spills. Place towels around the base of the machine to absorb any unexpected leaks. This helps to protect your flooring from water damage.

Think about the water itself. It might be hot, depending on when the machine stopped. Give it time to cool down before you start. This prevents burns. These simple safety steps protect you and your home.

## Identifying the Cause: Why Your Washing Machine Won't Drain

Your washing machine might not drain for several reasons. Understanding the cause helps you decide the best draining method. It also helps you plan for future repairs. A common issue is a clogged drain pump filter. Lint, small items, or even coins can block it.

Another frequent problem involves the drain hose. It might be kinked, blocked, or improperly installed. Check if the hose has any visible bends or obstructions. Sometimes, the washing machine's drain pump itself fails. This usually requires a replacement part.

Electrical issues or a faulty lid switch can also prevent the drain cycle from starting. Your washing machine might stop draining if its control board malfunctions. Knowing the potential problems guides your troubleshooting.

## Method 1: Draining Through the Drain Pump Filter

Draining your washing machine through the drain pump filter is often the easiest method. Most front-loading machines have a small access panel at the bottom front. This panel hides the drain pump filter. You can open this panel to find the filter cap.

Before opening, place a shallow pan or tray directly under the cap. A cookie sheet or a small baking dish works well. Have plenty of towels ready too. Slowly unscrew the cap to release the water. Water will flow out gradually, so empty your pan as it fills.

Be prepared for a surprising amount of water. It can take some time to drain completely. Once the water stops, you can fully remove the filter. Clean any debris from the filter and the housing. This step often solves simple draining issues.

## Method 2: Draining via the Drain Hose

If the drain pump filter method is not suitable or accessible, you can drain the water using the main drain hose. This hose usually connects from the back of the washing machine to a standpipe or utility sink. First, pull the washing machine out from the wall slightly to gain access. Ensure the machine remains stable.

Locate the drain hose at the back of the machine. It is typically a corrugated plastic hose. Have a large bucket or several smaller buckets ready. The hose must be lower than the water level inside the drum for gravity to work. Remove the hose from its connection point.

Carefully lower the end of the hose into your bucket. Water will begin to flow out immediately. You might need to hold the hose end steady to prevent spills. Continue draining until the drum is empty. This method works well for most top-loading and some front-loading machines.

### Draining Specific Models

Some washing machine models have unique features or access points for draining. For example, LG washing machines might have specific drain procedures that differ slightly. If you own an LG appliance, you can find detailed steps on [how to get LG washing machine to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-lg-washing-machine-to-drain).

## Dealing with a Completely Stuck Drain: Manual Water Removal

Sometimes, neither the drain pump filter nor the main drain hose fully drains the water. This can happen if the blockage is severe or if the pump is completely failed. In these cases, you might need to resort to manual water removal. This method requires patience and care.

You will need a small scoop, a cup, or even a wet-dry vacuum. If your machine is a top-loader, you can simply scoop water out of the drum. Use a small container to bail water into a bucket. This can be time-consuming but effective.

For front-loading machines, this process is more challenging. You might need to prop the machine up slightly at the front. This allows some water to flow towards the drain filter area, even if it is slow. A wet-dry vacuum is extremely useful here. Insert the hose into the drum or near the drain filter opening. It can quickly suction out large volumes of water. This prevents a big mess.

## After Draining: Next Steps and Troubleshooting

Once the water is out of your washing machine, you can investigate the actual problem. Start by checking the drain pump filter area again. Even if water drained out, debris might still be present. Remove the filter completely and clean it thoroughly under running water. Look inside the filter housing for any hidden obstructions.

Next, inspect the drain hose. Ensure it is not kinked or blocked where it connects to the wall or sink. You can also try flushing the hose with water to see if it flows freely. Sometimes, connecting the drain hose properly can fix the issue. You can read more about it for your specific brand, like [how to drain water in Whirlpool washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-water-in-whirlpool-washing-machine).

If the machine still does not drain after these checks, the issue might be internal. The drain pump itself could be faulty. You might hear a humming sound but no water movement if the pump is trying to work. Replacing a drain pump is a more advanced DIY task.

## When to Call a Professional: Knowing Your Limits

There are times when dealing with a broken washing machine requires professional help. If you have followed all the draining steps and the machine still holds water, or if you cannot identify the cause, it is smart to call an appliance technician. For example, if your machine is specifically a Maytag and it won't drain, knowing [why won't my Maytag washing machine drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-maytag-washing-machine-drain) might point you to issues best handled by experts.

Attempting complex repairs without proper knowledge or tools can cause more damage. It can also be unsafe. Technicians have specialized equipment to diagnose electrical issues or pump failures. They can quickly fix the problem.

Consider the cost of a professional repair versus the cost of a new machine. For older machines with recurring problems, a replacement might be more economical. However, for newer machines, a professional repair often saves you money in the long run. Do not hesitate to seek expert advice when needed.
