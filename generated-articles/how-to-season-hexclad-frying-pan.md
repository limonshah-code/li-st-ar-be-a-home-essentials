## Season Your Hexclad Frying Pan: A Complete Guide

Cooking becomes a true pleasure when your pans perform well. Many home cooks wonder about the best ways to care for their Hexclad frying pan. Specifically, the question often comes up: "How to season Hexclad frying pan?" You might think seasoning only applies to cast iron, but Hexclad, with its unique hybrid design, benefits greatly from this process. Proper seasoning enhances its non-stick properties and helps protect its surface. This article explains the simple steps to season your Hexclad pan, offering valuable tips to keep it cooking beautifully for years.

### Takeaway

*   Hexclad pans, while hybrid, benefit from initial and periodic seasoning.
*   Seasoning creates a natural, easy-release surface over time.
*   Use a high smoke point oil like grapeseed or canola for best results.
*   A thin layer of oil is key for effective seasoning.
*   Regular maintenance helps preserve the pan's performance.

To season a Hexclad frying pan, heat it over medium-low heat with a thin layer of high smoke point oil, like grapeseed or canola. Swirl the oil to coat the cooking surface, then let it heat until it barely smokes. Remove from heat, let it cool, and wipe out excess oil with a paper towel.

## Understanding Hexclad's Hybrid Design and Seasoning Needs

Hexclad cookware stands out in the kitchen world. It blends stainless steel and a non-stick coating into one pan. This unique design gives you the durability of steel with the convenience of non-stick. People often ask if a pan like this needs seasoning. The answer is yes, seasoning helps your Hexclad pan perform even better.

While Hexclad pans come with a non-stick coating, they are not like traditional Teflon pans. The hexagonal pattern is laser-etched stainless steel peaks surrounding non-stick valleys. This design means food directly touches both surfaces. Seasoning helps fill the tiny pores in the stainless steel parts. It creates an additional layer of non-stick protection on the entire cooking surface. This process makes your pan truly slick and easy to clean.

Understanding this difference helps you properly care for your Hexclad.
