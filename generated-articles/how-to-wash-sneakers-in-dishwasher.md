## Washing Sneakers in Your Dishwasher: A Complete Guide

Dirty sneakers can feel impossible to clean. Mud, grime, and sweat build up over time. You might wonder if there's an easier way than scrubbing by hand. Many people think about using their washing machine. But have you ever considered your dishwasher?

It sounds unusual, right? Using a kitchen appliance for shoes might seem strange. However, the dishwasher can offer a unique cleaning solution for certain types of footwear. It provides a contained washing environment. This method can effectively clean and refresh your dirty shoes. It saves you time and effort compared to traditional hand washing. This guide will show you how to wash sneakers in your dishwasher safely. We will cover which shoes are suitable. We will also explain the correct steps to get your sneakers sparkling clean.

### Takeaway

*   Only wash fabric or synthetic sneakers in the dishwasher. Avoid leather, suede, or delicate shoes.
*   Pre-clean shoes by removing loose dirt, laces, and insoles. Pre-treat any stubborn stains.
*   Use a cold water, gentle cycle with no heated dry. Opt for liquid dish soap, not harsh detergents.
*   Load shoes securely on the top rack, ensuring they do not block spray arms. Wash them alone.
*   Always air dry sneakers completely after washing. Never use a dryer or heated settings.

You can wash certain types of sneakers in a dishwasher. Ensure they are fabric or synthetic. Remove laces and insoles. Use a gentle cycle with cold water and no heat dry. This method cleans shoes effectively when done correctly.

### Is Washing Sneakers in a Dishwasher Safe for Your Shoes?

Using a dishwasher to clean your sneakers is a hot topic. Many people are curious about this method. The key question is always about safety. You can absolutely wash some types of sneakers in a dishwasher. However, this method is not for all shoes. Knowing which shoes are safe prevents damage.

#### Suitable Sneaker Materials

Dishwashers work best for shoes made from certain materials. Fabric sneakers, like canvas or cotton, are generally safe. Synthetic materials also respond well to this method. Shoes made from mesh are often good candidates. The cold water cycle helps these materials stay intact. Rubber elements on shoes also handle the dishwasher well. Think of your everyday running shoes or casual canvas sneakers. These materials are durable enough for a machine wash. They do not shrink or get damaged by water.

#### Materials to Avoid

Some shoe materials should never go into a dishwasher. Leather sneakers can crack or warp from water exposure. The heat, even a little, can ruin them. Suede shoes will suffer similar damage. They can become stiff or discolored. Shoes with delicate embellishments are also a no-go. This includes beads, sequins, or even reflective strips. These can fall off or get damaged. Battery-operated shoes, like light-up sneakers, should also stay out. Water can damage their internal electronics. If you have questions about specific shoe types, it is always best to clean them by hand. For insights on cleaning specific materials, consider reading our guides on [how to clean leather sneakers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leather-sneakers) or [how to clean white fabric sneakers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-fabric-sneakers) and [how to clean white mesh sneakers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-mesh-sneakers).

### Preparing Your Sneakers for a Dishwasher Clean

Putting dirty sneakers directly into your dishwasher is not a good idea. Proper preparation makes a big difference. It ensures a better clean for your shoes. It also protects your appliance from dirt buildup. Taking a few simple steps beforehand saves time in the long run.

#### Pre-Clean Steps

First, remove all loose dirt and debris from your sneakers. Take them outside and knock the soles together. Use an old brush or a paper towel to wipe off any mud. A butter knife can help scrape off stubborn grime from the treads. This step prevents large chunks of dirt from clogging your dishwasher. It also stops debris from redepositing onto your shoes during the wash. A quick pre-clean ensures your dishwasher can focus on deeper grime. It makes the overall washing process more effective.

#### Lace and Insole Removal

Always remove the shoelaces and insoles from your sneakers. Laces can get tangled around the dishwasher's spray arms. This can cause damage to the machine. They can also get caught in the filter. Insoles can hold onto odors and dirt. Washing them separately ensures a more thorough clean for both the insoles and the shoes. You can wash laces by hand with a little soap and water. You can also place them in a small mesh laundry bag inside the dishwasher. This keeps them secure during the wash cycle.

Pre-treating any visible stains with a spot cleaner is also a good idea at this stage.

### Choosing the Right Dishwasher Settings and Detergents for Sneakers

The settings you choose on your dishwasher are critical. They determine how well your sneakers get clean. More importantly, they protect your shoes from damage. Using the wrong settings can ruin your favorite pair. Similarly, the type of detergent matters greatly. Standard dishwasher detergents are often too harsh for fabrics.

#### Recommended Dishwasher Cycle

Always select a cold water cycle for your sneakers. Hot water can cause shoes to shrink. It can also warp their shape or melt adhesives. Choose a gentle or delicate cycle if your dishwasher has one. If not, pick the shortest wash cycle available. This minimizes agitation. It also reduces the time shoes are exposed to water. Avoid any cycle that includes a heated dry option. This heat can severely damage your shoes. It can also ruin the bond between the sole and the upper. Heat can also permanently set in stains.

#### Detergent Choices

Do not use your regular dishwasher detergent pods or powders. These are very strong. They are designed for food grease, not fabric. They can strip colors from your shoes. They can also leave residue. Instead, use a small amount of liquid dish soap. You can also use a mild laundry detergent. A tablespoon or two is usually enough. Put the detergent in the main dispenser cup. Avoid using any rinse aid. Rinse aids can leave a film on your sneakers. They are not necessary for cleaning shoes.

### How to Load Sneakers into Your Dishwasher Correctly

Proper loading is essential for effective cleaning. It also keeps your dishwasher safe. You do not want shoes to move around too much. Loose items can damage the spray arms or other parts of the machine. The goal is a secure wash.

#### Secure Placement

Place your sneakers on the top rack of the dishwasher. This keeps them away from the heating element, which is usually at the bottom. Position them facing down, or on their sides. This allows water to drain properly. You can use laundry bags made of mesh to hold the shoes. This keeps them from tumbling around. Alternatively, use shoe forms or plastic clips to secure them. Make sure they cannot block the spray arms. The water must reach all areas of the shoes for a thorough clean. Do not overcrowd the dishwasher. Two pairs of sneakers are usually the maximum for a single wash.

#### Avoiding Other Items

Never wash your sneakers with dishes or silverware. Shoes carry dirt, bacteria, and sometimes allergens. You do not want these mixing with items you eat from. Run a separate cycle just for your shoes. This maintains hygiene in your kitchen. It also ensures the dishwasher's focus is on cleaning your footwear. This dedicated approach prevents cross-contamination. It also lets you use the gentler settings needed for shoes. After the shoe wash, you might want to run an empty rinse cycle to clean the dishwasher itself. This ensures no shoe residue remains for your next load of dishes.

### Post-Wash Care: Drying Your Dishwasher-Washed Sneakers

The drying process is just as important as the washing cycle. Improper drying can undo all your cleaning efforts. It can damage your shoes. It can also lead to unpleasant odors. Air drying is the only safe method for dishwasher-washed sneakers.

#### The Importance of Air Drying

After the wash cycle finishes, immediately remove your sneakers from the dishwasher. Never use the heated dry cycle. The high heat from the dishwasher's drying element will ruin your shoes. It can melt glues, warp plastic components, and shrink fabric. Instead, air dry your shoes. This method preserves their shape and integrity. It also prevents any material degradation caused by heat. Patience is key here. Air drying can take time, sometimes up to 24-48 hours.

#### Reshaping and Deodorizing

Once removed, gently reshape your sneakers. You can stuff them with old newspapers or paper towels. This helps absorb excess moisture. It also helps the shoes maintain their original form as they dry. Change the newspaper or paper towels every few hours. This speeds up the drying process. Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade colors. A fan or dehumidifier can also help accelerate drying. To combat any lingering smells, sprinkle baking soda inside the dry shoes. You can also insert cedar shoe trees. These absorb moisture and odors. Ensure shoes are completely dry before wearing them again. This prevents mildew growth and odors.

### Pros and Cons of Washing Shoes in the Dishwasher

Deciding whether to wash your sneakers in the dishwasher involves weighing its benefits against potential drawbacks. It is a convenient method for some. However, it is not always the perfect solution for everyone or every type of shoe. Understanding these points helps you make an informed decision.

#### Benefits

One major benefit is the deep clean your sneakers receive. The powerful water jets in a dishwasher can reach deep into crevices. This helps remove embedded dirt and grime more effectively than hand washing. It also saves you effort. You simply load the shoes and start the cycle. This is much less physically demanding than scrubbing each shoe individually. The dishwasher also provides a contained washing environment. This means no messy puddles on your floor. For certain synthetic or fabric shoes, this method can also offer a level of sanitization. The cleaning agents help eliminate odors and bacteria. This leaves your sneakers feeling fresh and clean.

#### Drawbacks

Despite the benefits, there are notable drawbacks. The biggest risk is damage to your shoes. As discussed, certain materials like leather or suede are simply not suited for this method. They can be permanently ruined by water and heat. Even safe materials can warp or lose their shape if not dried properly. Another downside is that the dishwasher is occupied during the wash cycle. You cannot wash dishes at the same time. This can be inconvenient for busy households. Also, some people are concerned about hygiene. While you should wash shoes separately, some might find the idea of shoes in a kitchen appliance unappealing. You also need to clean the dishwasher afterward.

### Maintaining Your Dishwasher After Washing Sneakers

After you wash sneakers in your dishwasher, it is important to clean the appliance itself. Shoes can leave behind dirt, small particles, or even a lingering smell. Taking a few extra steps ensures your dishwasher stays clean and hygienic for your dishes. This also helps prolong its lifespan.

You do not want shoe grime mixing with your plates and cutlery. Run an empty hot water rinse cycle immediately after the shoe wash. This helps flush out any loose dirt or debris. It also rinses away any detergent residue that might be left. For a deeper clean and to remove any lingering odors, consider using vinegar. Place a cup of white vinegar in a dishwasher-safe bowl on the top rack. Run a hot water cycle with the dishwasher empty. The vinegar acts as a natural disinfectant and deodorizer. It helps break down any build-up and leaves the appliance fresh.

You can also wipe down the inside of the dishwasher. Use a damp cloth to clean the walls and door. Pay attention to the filter screen at the bottom. Remove and clean it if needed. This step ensures no shoe particles remain trapped. Regularly cleaning your dishwasher is good practice anyway. This is especially true after washing non-food items like shoes. For comprehensive instructions on cleaning your dishwasher, refer to our detailed guide: [how to wash your dishwasher with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-your-dishwasher-with-vinegar). This proactive cleaning prevents cross-contamination. It also keeps your dishwasher operating efficiently.
