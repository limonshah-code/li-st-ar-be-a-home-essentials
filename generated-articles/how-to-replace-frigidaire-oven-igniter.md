## Restore Your Oven's Heat: How To Replace a Frigidaire Igniter

Imagine getting ready to bake your favorite cookies or roast a delicious dinner. You preheat your oven, but nothing happens. The oven does not get hot. This can be very frustrating, especially when hunger strikes. A common reason for this issue in gas ovens is a faulty igniter.

If you own a Frigidaire gas oven and it is not heating properly, a failed igniter is often the culprit. Replacing a Frigidaire oven igniter might seem like a difficult task. However, it is a repair you can often do yourself with some basic tools and clear instructions. This comprehensive guide will walk you through each step. I will show you how to safely and effectively replace your Frigidaire oven igniter, helping you get your kitchen back in working order quickly.

### Takeaway

Replacing a Frigidaire oven igniter restores your oven's heating function.
*   Always prioritize safety by disconnecting power and shutting off gas.
*   Gather the correct tools and a compatible replacement part.
*   Follow the step-by-step instructions carefully for removal and installation.
*   Perform a final test to ensure proper operation.

### Clear and Concise Answer

You can replace a Frigidaire oven igniter by first disconnecting power and gas. Then, access the igniter by removing the oven's bottom panel and heat shield. Disconnect the old igniter's wires, unmount it, and install the new one by reversing the steps. Finally, reconnect power and gas, then test the oven.

## Understanding Your Frigidaire Oven Igniter

The igniter in your Frigidaire gas oven plays a crucial role. It does two main jobs. First, it heats up to glow white hot. This intense heat then ignites the gas flowing into the burner. Second, the igniter acts as a safety sensor. It detects if the gas has ignited properly. If it does not detect a flame, the igniter signals the gas valve to shut off. This prevents unburnt gas from filling your kitchen.

Most modern gas ovens, including Frigidaire models, use a glow bar igniter. This component is made of silicon carbide. It needs to reach a very high temperature before it can ignite the gas. Over time, these igniters wear out. They become weak and cannot reach the necessary temperature.

### Signs of a Failing Igniter

How do you know if your Frigidaire oven igniter is failing? There are several common signs. The most obvious sign is that your oven does not heat up at all. You might hear the gas trying to come on, but no flame appears. Another sign is if the oven takes a very long time to preheat. This happens because the igniter is too weak to ignite the gas quickly. Sometimes, you might even smell a slight gas odor without ignition. This smell indicates that gas is flowing but not burning. In some cases, the oven might light briefly and then shut off. This often means the igniter is not maintaining a strong enough heat or sensing the flame correctly. If you observe any of these symptoms, replacing the igniter is likely the solution. Understanding how this component works helps you diagnose problems effectively.

## Safety First: Preparing for Igniter Replacement

Before you begin any appliance repair, safety must be your top priority. Working with gas and electricity carries risks. Taking the right precautions protects you from injury and prevents damage to your appliance. Never skip these critical first steps. They are simple but essential.

Always start by ensuring the oven is cool. Attempting to work on a hot oven can cause severe burns. Allow plenty of time for the appliance to cool down completely after use. This step ensures your safety during the repair process.

### Disconnecting Power and Gas

The very first thing you must do is cut off power to the oven. You can do this in two ways. First, unplug the oven from the wall outlet if the cord is accessible. Many ovens are hardwired. If yours is hardwired, go to your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker labeled for your oven or kitchen. Flip this breaker to the "OFF" position. This stops electricity from reaching the appliance.

Next, you must shut off the gas supply to the oven. Look for a shut-off valve behind the oven. It usually looks like a small knob or lever on the gas line. Turn this valve perpendicular to the gas pipe to shut off the gas flow. If you cannot find a specific oven shut-off, you may need to turn off the main gas supply to your house. This step is critical to prevent gas leaks. Working on a gas appliance with the gas supply on is extremely dangerous. Make sure both power and gas are off before proceeding with any part of the repair. Taking these precautions helps keep you safe.

## Tools and Parts You'll Need

Gathering all your tools and the correct replacement parts before you start saves time and frustration. Having everything ready means you can complete the repair efficiently. You will not need to stop midway to find something missing. This preparation makes the whole process smoother.

### Essential Tools

You will need a few basic tools for this repair. Most of these are common household items.

*   **Screwdriver set:** You will likely need both Phillips head and flat-head screwdrivers. Some oven models might use Torx screws, so a multi-bit screwdriver set is best.
*   **Nut driver or small socket set:** Many oven components, including the igniter, are held in place with nuts. A 1/4-inch nut driver is very common for this.
*   **Wire strippers/cutters:** You might need these if your replacement igniter does not come with a plug connector. Sometimes, you need to cut and splice wires.
*   **Pliers:** Needle-nose pliers can be helpful for gripping small wires or connectors.
*   **Work gloves:** Protect your hands from sharp edges inside the oven.
*   **Headlamp or flashlight:** The oven interior can be dark, and a good light source helps you see clearly.

### Getting the Right Replacement Igniter

This is the most crucial part. You must get the correct replacement Frigidaire oven igniter. Igniters are not universal. Different Frigidaire models use different igniters. Look for your oven's model number. You can usually find it on a sticker or plate around the oven door frame, inside the storage drawer, or on the back of the appliance. Once you have the model number, search online for "Frigidaire [Your Model Number] oven igniter." Websites that sell appliance parts will list compatible igniters.

Ensure the new igniter matches the old one perfectly. Pay attention to the physical shape, the mounting bracket, and the type of electrical connector. Some igniters come with universal ceramic wire nuts. Others have specific plug connectors. Choosing the correct part ensures a successful replacement and proper operation. Replacing a different Frigidaire component, such as the oven bake element, also requires specific part matching.

## Accessing the Igniter in Your Frigidaire Oven

Once you have prepared your tools and the new part, you can start opening up your oven. The igniter is typically located near the bottom of the oven, usually attached to the bake burner tube. Gaining access involves removing some interior components. This process is straightforward. Take your time and be careful not to damage any parts.

### Removing Oven Racks and Bottom Panel

First, open your Frigidaire oven door. Remove all oven racks from inside the cavity. This gives you clear access and more space to work. Set the racks aside where they will not get in your way.

Next, you need to remove the oven's bottom panel. This panel is usually held in place by two or more screws. These screws are typically located at the back corners of the panel. Use your Phillips head or flat-head screwdriver to remove these screws. Once the screws are out, lift the front edge of the panel slightly. Then, pull the entire panel towards you and up. The panel should slide out easily. It might be tucked under a lip at the front. Set this panel aside carefully. Underneath the bottom panel, you will see a metal heat shield. This shield protects the floor of the oven from direct flame. It is also usually held by a few screws. Remove these screws and lift the heat shield out. Now, you have a clear view of the bake burner tube and the igniter. The igniter is typically mounted next to or directly below the burner tube.

## Disconnecting and Removing the Old Igniter

With the interior panels removed, the old igniter should be clearly visible. It is usually a fragile, gray, or white ceramic bar. This part connects to the oven's wiring. You need to handle it gently, as it can be brittle, especially if it is already failing. Take a moment to observe how the old igniter is mounted and wired. This helps you understand how to install the new one.

### Unmounting the Igniter

The igniter is typically held in place by two screws. These screws secure a small metal bracket that holds the igniter to the burner tube or the oven frame. Use your nut driver or small socket to carefully loosen and remove these screws. Sometimes, the screws can be tight or rusted. Apply steady pressure to avoid stripping the screw heads. Once the screws are removed, the igniter should be free from its mounting bracket. Be careful not to drop it. The ceramic material can break easily.

### Detaching Electrical Connections

After unmounting the igniter, you will see its two electrical wires. These wires connect to the oven's main wiring harness. There are generally two types of connections. Some igniters use a plug-in connector. This is usually a white plastic connector that simply pulls apart. Gently pull the two halves of the connector apart. If your igniter has wire leads that are spliced directly to the oven's wires, they will be connected with ceramic wire nuts. These wire nuts are heat-resistant. Twist them counter-clockwise to remove them. Carefully separate the wires. Take a mental note or a picture of how the wires were connected. This helps ensure you connect the new igniter correctly. Pull the old igniter and its attached wires out of the oven cavity. The process for checking a gas oven igniter involves similar access steps, allowing you to visually inspect its condition before removal. You can learn how to perform this check by consulting our guide on [how to check gas oven igniter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-check-gas-oven-igniter).

## Installing Your New Frigidaire Oven Igniter

Now that the old igniter is out, it's time to install the new one. This process is essentially the reverse of removal. Take your time to ensure all connections are secure and the igniter is properly mounted. Proper installation ensures your oven functions safely and correctly. Handle the new igniter with care. It is a fragile component.

### Connecting the New Igniter's Wires

First, you need to connect the electrical wires of your new igniter. If your new igniter came with a plug-in connector, simply align the two halves and push them together until they click. Make sure the connection is firm and secure.

If your new igniter came with bare wire leads, or if you purchased a universal igniter, you will need to use the ceramic wire nuts provided. Twist the ends of the new igniter's wires together with the corresponding oven wires. Make sure you connect the correct wires to each other. Then, twist the ceramic wire nuts clockwise onto the twisted wires. Pull gently on each wire to ensure the connection is solid and cannot come loose. These ceramic wire nuts are designed to withstand high temperatures. Do not use plastic wire nuts. They will melt. Proper wiring is crucial for the igniter to receive power and function correctly.

### Mounting the New Igniter

Once the wiring is complete, position the new igniter in its mounting location. This is usually next to or directly below the bake burner tube. Align the igniter's mounting bracket with the screw holes you used to remove the old one. Carefully insert and tighten the two screws that secure the igniter in place. Do not overtighten the screws, as this could damage the ceramic body of the igniter. Ensure the igniter is stable and does not wobble. It should be securely fixed in its position. The exact mounting position is important for the igniter to be effective at igniting the gas. Double-check that it is oriented correctly. The igniter's tip should be very close to the gas ports on the burner tube. This close proximity ensures proper ignition when gas flows. With the new igniter securely in place and wired, you are almost done.

## Testing and Final Steps After Replacement

You have installed the new Frigidaire oven igniter. Now comes the moment of truth: testing. Before you fully reassemble your oven, perform a preliminary test to ensure the igniter works. This step helps confirm your repair was successful without having to undo everything later.

### Initial Function Test

With the new igniter connected and mounted, and the heat shield potentially still off (or loosely placed), you can perform a test. First, turn the gas supply back on. Go to the gas shut-off valve behind the oven and turn it parallel to the gas pipe. Next, restore power to the oven. If you unplugged it, plug it back in. If you flipped a circuit breaker, turn it back to the "ON" position.

Now, set your oven to bake at a low temperature, like 350°F (175°C). Listen carefully. You should hear a click or faint hiss as the gas valve opens. Watch the igniter. It should begin to glow. It will start with a dull orange and slowly get brighter, turning white-hot. This process typically takes 30 to 60 seconds. Once the igniter is glowing intensely, the gas should ignite with a soft "whoosh" sound. You should see a blue flame around the burner tube. If the igniter glows but no flame appears, or if it takes too long to ignite, shut off the gas and power immediately. There might be a gas flow issue or a problem with the new igniter. However, if everything works as expected, turn off the oven.

### Reassembling Your Frigidaire Oven

Once you confirm the igniter is working, you can put your Frigidaire oven back together. First, replace the metal heat shield. Ensure it is oriented correctly and secure it with its screws. Next, position the oven's bottom panel. Slide it under the front lip if applicable, then lower the back into place. Secure the panel with its screws. Finally, replace all the oven racks you removed earlier.

With everything reassembled, you are ready to use your oven again. As a final check, bake something simple, like a frozen pizza or a batch of cookies, to confirm consistent heating.
