After disconnecting everything, drain all remaining water. Tilt the machine slowly to help water flow out. Secure any loose hoses or cords. Use tape to secure them to the machine's body. This prevents them from snagging or tripping someone. If possible, lock the drum in place. This prevents it from shifting during transport.

## Environmental Impact of Proper Washing Machine Disposal

The way we dispose of old appliances like washing machines has a significant environmental impact. Washing machines are not just large metal boxes. They contain various materials that can harm the environment if mishandled. Proper disposal prevents pollution. It also conserves valuable resources.

Appliances also contain plastics and electronic components. Some older units may have hazardous materials. These include mercury switches or certain refrigerants (though less common in modern washing machines than refrigerators). These substances must not enter landfills. They can leach into soil and groundwater. This pollutes ecosystems and harms wildlife.

*   **Resource Conservation:** Recycling metal components reduces demand for raw materials.
*   **Energy Savings:** Producing new metals from recycled ones uses less energy than from virgin ore.
