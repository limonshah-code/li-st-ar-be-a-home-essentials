## LG Dryer Runs But Won't Heat? Here's Why!

There is nothing quite like pulling damp clothes from a dryer that has run its full cycle. That frustrating moment when your LG dryer is running but not heating can throw off your entire laundry routine. I know this feeling well, as it means extra waiting or even rewashing items. You expect warm, dry clothes, but instead, you get cold, damp ones. This issue is a common household problem that many LG dryer owners face.

This guide helps you understand why your LG dryer might be experiencing this heating failure. We will explore the most common culprits, from simple fixes like clogged vents to more complex component failures. I will walk you through troubleshooting steps to diagnose the problem effectively. By the end, you will have a clear idea of what is preventing your dryer from heating and how to address it.

### Takeaway

*   **Check power supply:** Ensure the dryer has a proper 240V connection for electric models.
*   **Clean lint filter and vents:** Clogged airflow is a major cause of no heat.
*   **Inspect heating element:** This is a common part to fail in electric dryers.
*   **Examine thermal fuse/thermostats:** These safety components can stop heat if triggered.
*   **Look at gas igniter:** For gas dryers, a faulty igniter prevents the burner from lighting.
*   **Consider professional help:** Complex issues like control board or motor problems often require a technician.

Your LG dryer is running but not heating typically because of a faulty heating element, a blown thermal fuse, a tripped high-limit thermostat, or restricted airflow due to clogged vents. For gas models, a defective igniter or gas valve can prevent heat production.

### Common Culprit: Faulty Heating Element (Electric Dryers)

When your electric LG dryer is running but not heating, the heating element is a frequent suspect. The heating element is a coiled wire that generates the heat needed to dry your clothes. Over time, these coils can break or burn out due to constant heating and cooling. This component is essential for any electric dryer's operation.

A common sign of a failed heating element is that the dryer still tumbles and spins, but no warm air comes out. You might notice your clothes remain damp even after a long cycle. You can often visually inspect the element for obvious breaks or scorch marks. However, a multimeter provides a more accurate test for continuity.

Accessing the heating element usually requires removing the back panel of your LG dryer. Always unplug the dryer before attempting any internal inspection or repair. If you find the element is broken, it needs replacement. This is a common DIY repair, but it requires careful handling.

Replacing the heating element involves disconnecting wires and mounting screws, then installing the new part. While the process may differ slightly, the principles are similar across brands. For a general idea of the process, you can refer to resources on [how to replace a heating element in a Samsung dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-heating-element-in-samsung-dryer-dv40j3000ew-a2). Ensure you get the correct part number for your specific LG dryer model.

### Addressing Gas Dryer Igniter Issues (Gas Dryers)

If you have a gas LG dryer running but not heating, the problem source differs slightly from electric models. Gas dryers use a gas burner to produce heat, and an igniter is crucial for this process. The igniter warms up to a high temperature, igniting the gas that then heats the air. Without a working igniter, the gas cannot light, and your dryer will blow only cold air.

One common issue is a faulty igniter. Over time, the igniter can become weak or crack, preventing it from getting hot enough to ignite the gas. You might hear the dryer attempting to light, perhaps a clicking sound, but no flame appears. Another possibility is a problem with the gas valve coils. These coils control the flow of gas to the burner. If they fail, gas will not reach the igniter, meaning no heat.

Troubleshooting a gas dryer's heating system requires caution. Always ensure the gas supply is turned off before you start any work. You can visually inspect the igniter for cracks or a burnt appearance. Testing the igniter's resistance with a multimeter can confirm if it is faulty. If the igniter is glowing but the gas is not igniting, the gas valve coils are likely the problem.

Repairing gas dryer components is more complex and poses safety risks due to the gas line. If you are uncomfortable working with gas, I strongly recommend calling a certified appliance technician. Your safety is paramount, and improper repairs can lead to gas leaks or fire hazards.

### Overheating Protectors: Thermal Fuse & Thermostat

Dryers have safety mechanisms to prevent overheating, and these can be why your LG dryer is running but not heating. The thermal fuse is a one-time safety device that blows if the dryer gets too hot. Once it blows, it interrupts the circuit to the heating element, cutting off heat permanently until replaced. This fuse protects your dryer from potential fire hazards.

The cycling thermostat works differently. It monitors the air temperature inside the dryer drum and cycles the heating element on and off to maintain the desired temperature. If this thermostat fails, it might not signal the heating element to turn on, or it could prevent proper temperature regulation. A high-limit thermostat also exists, acting as a secondary safety measure, tripping if the cycling thermostat fails to shut off the heat at extreme temperatures. When it trips, it often needs to be reset or replaced.

You can often test both the thermal fuse and thermostats using a multimeter for continuity. A blown thermal fuse will show no continuity, indicating it needs replacement. Thermostats should show continuity at room temperature and then change based on temperature. Restricted airflow from lint buildup often causes these components to trip or blow. This is why addressing ventilation issues is very important.

If your dryer keeps shutting off before clothes are dry, it could indicate an overheating problem that these components are trying to prevent. Learn more about [why your LG dryer keeps shutting off before clothes are dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-keep-shutting-off-before-clothes-are-dry) to understand how these safety features relate to performance. Always unplug the dryer before testing or replacing these parts.

### Airflow Obstruction: Vents and Lint Trap

A common and often overlooked reason why your LG dryer is running but not heating is airflow obstruction. Proper airflow is critical for a dryer to heat efficiently and safely. Hot, moist air needs to exhaust properly for fresh, dry air to enter and be heated. If this airflow is blocked, the heating element (or gas burner) may shut off prematurely or not activate at all as a safety measure. This is a primary cause of inefficiency.

The most common culprit for restricted airflow is a clogged lint trap. The lint trap collects lint from your clothes during the drying cycle. If it gets too full, air cannot pass through easily, leading to poor heating and longer drying times. I make it a habit to clean my lint trap before every load. Beyond the lint trap, the dryer's exhaust vent can become clogged with lint buildup over time. This vent runs from the back of your dryer to the outside of your home. A clogged vent traps hot, moist air inside the dryer, preventing effective drying and potentially tripping safety thermostats.

Cleaning your lint trap is simple and should be done after every load. For the dryer exhaust vent, regular cleaning is also essential. You should disconnect the dryer and use a vacuum or a specialized brush to clear out lint from the flexible duct and the wall vent. If you're wondering how to properly maintain your dryer, there are specific guides available. For example, you can learn [how to clean your dryer machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dryer-machine) effectively, or even more specifically, [how to clean an LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer) to ensure optimal performance.

Beyond safety, poor airflow also means your clothes take much longer to dry, wasting energy and time. This leads directly to issues like [why your LG dryer takes so long to dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-take-so-long-to-dry). Regular cleaning of both the lint trap and the exhaust system is a simple yet crucial maintenance step. It keeps your dryer running efficiently and safely.

### Motor Issues and Blower Wheel Problems

While the motor primarily drives the drum's rotation, it also plays a direct role in heating. The motor powers the blower wheel, which is responsible for circulating air through the dryer. This circulation draws in fresh air, moves it over the heating element (or gas burner), and then pushes the heated, moist air out through the exhaust vent. If the motor is weak or the blower wheel is obstructed or faulty, airflow is compromised.

A problem with the motor or blower wheel will cause poor air circulation. Even if the heating element is working perfectly, the heat cannot be properly distributed throughout the drum. This means your clothes will not dry effectively. You might notice the dryer running, but the clothes are still damp, or the drying cycle takes an unusually long time. Sometimes, you might hear unusual noises, like grinding or squealing, coming from the dryer.

Inspecting the blower wheel involves accessing it, usually from the front or back of the dryer. Check for any lint buildup or foreign objects that might be jamming the wheel. A broken blower wheel can also prevent proper airflow. If the motor is failing, it might struggle to turn the drum or power the blower, leading to insufficient airflow for heating.

If you suspect a motor or blower wheel issue, it is a more involved repair. The motor is a core component, and its replacement can be complex. While inspecting for obstructions is a good first step, actual motor or blower wheel replacement often requires a professional. These components need precise installation to function correctly and safely.

### Control Board and Wiring Concerns

The control board acts as the brain of your LG dryer, sending signals to all its components, including the heating element or igniter. It processes information from sensors and user selections to ensure the dryer operates correctly. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the correct signal to the heating circuit, causing your LG dryer to run but not heat. This can be a frustrating issue to diagnose.

A faulty control board can manifest in various ways, such as the dryer not responding to commands, displaying error codes, or simply failing to initiate the heat cycle. Sometimes, visible signs like burnt spots or damaged circuits on the board indicate a problem. However, often the failure is internal and not easily visible. Troubleshooting a control board typically requires specialized knowledge and testing tools.

Wiring problems are another potential cause. Loose or corroded wires can disrupt the electrical flow to the heating element, thermostats, or igniter. A damaged wire might prevent a component from receiving power, even if the component itself is functional. I once found a loose connection causing intermittent issues, which taught me the importance of checking all connections. These issues can be subtle and hard to spot.

Inspecting wiring involves carefully checking all connections to the heating element, thermal fuse, thermostats, and the main power supply. Ensure wires are securely attached and show no signs of burning or fraying. However, diagnosing a control board or complex wiring issue usually requires a skilled technician. Attempting to repair a control board without proper expertise can cause further damage or pose safety risks.

### Power Supply Issues

Sometimes, the reason your electric LG dryer is running but not heating is not a component failure but a power supply problem. Electric dryers typically require a 240-volt power supply, using two separate hot wires to power the heating element. If one of these circuits loses power, the dryer's motor and controls might still function, allowing the drum to tumble and lights to come on, but the heating element will not receive enough voltage to generate heat.

This situation usually happens due to a tripped breaker in your home's electrical panel. Each dryer has a dedicated double-pole breaker. If one side of this breaker trips, it can cut power to half of the dryer's circuit. This leaves enough power for the motor to run but not enough for the heating element. It's a common oversight, as the dryer appears to be working, just without heat.

To check for this, go to your home's electrical service panel. Look for the breaker labeled for your dryer. It should be a larger, double breaker. If one side is flipped to the "off" position or is in an intermediate "tripped" position, reset it by pushing it completely to "off" and then back to "on." If the breaker trips again immediately after resetting, there is a short circuit or an overloaded circuit. This indicates a deeper electrical issue that needs professional attention.

Ensuring your dryer has a stable, full 240-volt supply is a quick and essential troubleshooting step. I always recommend starting here because it is simple and costs nothing. If the breaker is fine, then you can move on to internal dryer components.
