### Common Electrical Problems Affecting LG Ovens

An LG oven needs stable electricity. If the power supply is not right, the oven will shut down. This is a safety feature. It stops electrical surges or drops from harming the appliance. You should check a few things first.

First, look at your home's circuit breaker. An oven draws a lot of power. If it overloads the circuit, the breaker will trip. This cuts power to the oven. Reset the breaker. If it trips again, there is a serious electrical problem. You might have too many appliances on one circuit. Or, the circuit breaker itself could be faulty.

Second, inspect the power cord. The oven's cord connects to the wall outlet. Check for damage. Look for frayed wires or burnt spots. A damaged cord cannot provide consistent power. This can cause the oven to turn off. Replace any damaged cords immediately. Also, ensure the outlet works. Plug in another appliance to test it. If the outlet does not work, it needs repair. A loose connection at the outlet or inside the oven can also cause issues.

Sometimes, the electrical wiring in your home is old. Old wiring may not handle the oven's power needs. This can cause the oven to trip breakers often. A professional electrician can inspect your home's wiring. They can tell you if an upgrade is necessary. Ensuring proper electrical flow is vital for your oven's performance.

### Thermostat and Temperature Sensor Failures in LG Ovens

Your LG oven relies on a thermostat and temperature sensor. These parts work together. They maintain the set temperature. If either part fails, the oven cannot regulate heat. The oven might get too hot. Or, it might not heat enough. When the temperature goes too high, the oven shuts off. This prevents fires or damage.

The thermostat tells the oven what temperature to hold. If it is faulty, it sends wrong signals. This can make the oven overheat. The temperature sensor measures the actual temperature inside. It sends this data to the control board. If the sensor is bad, it gives incorrect readings. The control board thinks the oven is hotter than it is. It then might shut down the heating elements.

You can test the temperature sensor. Use a multimeter to check its resistance. The resistance should change with temperature. If it does not, the sensor is likely bad. Replacing a faulty temperature sensor is often a simple repair. It involves unplugging the old sensor and plugging in a new one.

Sometimes, cleaning the sensor helps. Grease or food spills can coat it. This can affect its accuracy. Use a soft cloth to gently wipe it clean. If cleaning does not help, replacement is the next step. A new sensor helps your LG oven maintain proper cooking temperatures. If your oven is a different brand, like a [Frigidaire oven keeping turning off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-oven-keep-turning-off), the thermostat or sensor is also a common suspect.

### Overheating and Thermal Fuse Issues in LG Ovens

Ovens can overheat. This happens for several reasons. It is a serious problem. Modern LG ovens have safety features. One key feature is the thermal fuse. This fuse protects the oven from excessive heat. If the oven temperature rises beyond a safe limit, the thermal fuse will blow. When it blows, it cuts power to the oven. This prevents damage or fire.

Why does an oven overheat? A faulty thermostat is a common reason. It might not signal the heating elements to turn off. This causes the oven to keep heating. Another reason is a blocked vent. Ovens need air circulation. If vents are covered, heat builds up inside. This can lead to overheating. Make sure nothing blocks the oven's vents. This includes large baking sheets or foil.

A malfunctioning cooling fan also causes overheating. The cooling fan helps remove hot air from the oven. If it fails, heat gets trapped. This will raise the internal temperature. When the thermal fuse blows, it is a sign of a deeper issue. You cannot just replace the fuse. You must find and fix the cause of the overheating.

Replacing a thermal fuse requires caution. It means working with electrical components. Always disconnect power to the oven first. The fuse is usually located near the oven's heating elements or control board. If you do not feel comfortable doing this, call a professional. Ignoring overheating issues can be dangerous. Your oven might stop working altogether, similar to problems faced when a [Samsung oven is not turning on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-oven-not-turning-on) due to internal failures.

### Troubleshooting the LG Oven Control Board

The control board is the brain of your LG oven. It manages all functions. This includes temperature settings, cooking modes, and safety features. If the control board malfunctions, your oven can behave erratically. It might turn off unexpectedly. It might not respond to commands.

Signs of a faulty control board include:
*   Error codes on the display.
*   Buttons not working.
