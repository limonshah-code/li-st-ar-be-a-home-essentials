### Takeaway

Keeping scorpions out of your bed involves a multi-layered approach focusing on exclusion, pest control, and making your bedroom an undesirable habitat.

To keep scorpions out of your bed, seal house cracks, eliminate their food and water sources, place bed legs in glass jars or sticky traps, and keep bedding off the floor. Regular inspections and a tidy living space significantly reduce risk.

## Understanding Scorpions: Knowing Your Foe

Scorpions are nocturnal creatures. They seek shelter during the day. They prefer dark, cool, and damp places. Inside a house, these spots can include basements, crawl spaces, wall voids, and even inside shoes or clothes. Knowing their habits helps you understand how to prevent them from entering your home and, more specifically, your bed.

They often enter homes through small cracks or gaps. A gap as thin as a credit card can be an entry point. Scorpions also follow prey. They eat insects like crickets, spiders, and cockroaches. If your home has these other pests, scorpions will likely follow.

Most scorpions are not deadly to humans. However, their stings are painful. Some species, like the Arizona Bark Scorpion, have dangerous venom. Knowing which types of scorpions live in your area is helpful. Always assume any scorpion sting will be painful and take precautions.

Scorpions are resilient. They can survive long periods without food or water. This makes them tough to get rid of once inside. Effective prevention involves disrupting their habitat and entry. You must create an environment they want to avoid.

## Sealing Your Home's Entry Points

The first line of defense is to block scorpions from coming inside. Scorpions can squeeze through tiny openings. You must check your home for any gaps or cracks. Look at doors, windows, and foundations. This step is critical for pest control.

Start by examining exterior doors. Check the weather stripping. Make sure it forms a tight seal. Replace old or damaged weather stripping. Install door sweeps on all exterior doors. These sweeps block gaps at the bottom.

Inspect all windows. Look for gaps around window frames. Use caulk to seal these openings. Check window screens for tears. Repair or replace any damaged screens. Scorpions can use these small holes to enter.

Next, examine your home's foundation. Look for cracks in the concrete or masonry. Fill these cracks with concrete caulk. Check for gaps around pipes or wires entering your home. Use steel wool or expanding foam to seal these areas. Even small openings are an invitation for pests.

Do not forget utility lines. Look at lines for air conditioning units or cables. Seal around them where they enter the house. This meticulous sealing creates a robust barrier. It makes it much harder for scorpions to find their way inside.

## Eliminating Scorpion Food Sources

Scorpions come indoors for two main reasons: shelter and food. By removing their food supply, you make your home less attractive. Scorpions eat other insects and spiders. Controlling these common household pests significantly helps keep scorpions away.

Pests like cockroaches, crickets, and spiders are primary scorpion prey. If you see these bugs, you likely have a scorpion food source. Set traps for these insects. Use sticky traps or bait stations. Keep your kitchen clean. Wipe up crumbs and spills immediately. Store food in sealed containers.

Reduce moisture in your home. Many insects, like cockroaches, thrive in damp conditions. Fix leaky pipes and faucets. Use a dehumidifier in basements or crawl spaces. This makes your home less appealing to insects, which in turn deters scorpions.

Regularly clean your living space. Vacuum often to pick up crumbs and insect eggs. Sweep floors and clean under furniture. [How to clean under bed](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-under-bed) is a great resource for clearing out dust and potential hiding spots for prey insects. A clean home has fewer bugs. Fewer bugs mean fewer reasons for scorpions to visit.

Consider using insecticidal dust or sprays in cracks and crevices. These treatments target the bugs scorpions eat. Always follow product instructions. Reducing the overall insect population creates a hostile environment for scorpions.

## Creating a Scorpion-Free Bedroom Barrier

Once your home is sealed, focus on your bedroom. You want to make your bed an island. This means creating a physical barrier scorpions cannot cross. This strategy protects your sleeping area directly. It gives you peace of mind.

Move your bed away from walls. Leave a few inches of space on all sides. Scorpions often climb walls and then drop onto beds. An air gap makes this harder. This simple step forms an important barrier.

Ensure bed skirts or blankets do not touch the floor. Scorpions can climb up fabric. Lift all bedding so it hangs freely. Tuck in sheets tightly. This removes any "bridges" for scorpions to use.

Consider placing glass jars or sticky traps under each bed leg. Scorpions cannot climb smooth glass. They will get stuck on sticky traps. This creates a final line of defense around your bed. Check these traps regularly.

Inspect your bed before getting in. Quickly check sheets and pillows. Also, check inside shoes or clothes left on the floor. Scorpions love dark, hidden spots.

A quick check takes seconds. This small habit provides great security.

## Treating the Perimeter: Indoor and Outdoor Solutions

Treating the areas around your home and inside is key. This forms a protective zone. Chemical and natural solutions can deter scorpions. You can apply these treatments yourself or hire a professional. Effective treatment reduces scorpion activity near your home.

For outdoor treatment, apply an insecticide around your home's foundation. Extend the treatment several feet out from the wall. Focus on areas where scorpions hide. These include rocks, woodpiles, and dense vegetation. Granular insecticides or liquid sprays work well. Reapply as needed, especially after rain.

Inside your home, use residual insecticides in cracks and crevices. Apply them along baseboards, under sinks, and in closets. These areas are common scorpion hiding spots. Follow product labels carefully. Ensure safety for people and pets.

Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural option. It is a fine powder made from fossilized algae. It works by absorbing oils from insect exoskeletons, causing dehydration. Sprinkle food-grade DE in cracks, wall voids, and attics. It is safe for pets and humans but deadly to scorpions and other insects.

For persistent scorpion problems, professional pest control is the best choice. Exterminators have stronger products and expert knowledge. They can identify entry points and scorpion nests. They also provide targeted treatments. This can be very effective in severe infestations.

## Regular Inspection and Maintenance

Prevention is an ongoing task. Regular checks and cleaning maintain your defenses. This keeps scorpions from returning. A consistent routine ensures your home remains safe. Do not wait for a scorpion sighting to act.

Inspect your home's exterior monthly. Look for new cracks in the foundation. Check door and window seals. Repair any damage right away. Small issues can become big problems if ignored. This proactive approach saves trouble later.

Clean your bedroom often. Vacuum carpets and sweep hard floors. Mop under the bed. [How to clean bed pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bed-pillows) and other bedding regularly helps remove dust and potential insect debris. Clutter provides hiding spots. Keep clothes off the floor. Put shoes away in sealed bins.

Check outdoor areas for debris. Remove rock piles, logs, and excessive leaf litter. These are perfect scorpion habitats. Trim bushes and trees away from your house walls. They can provide a bridge for scorpions to climb onto your home.

Inside, continue to monitor for other pests. If you see ants, roaches, or crickets, address them quickly. These are signs of a food source for scorpions. A comprehensive pest management plan is vital. Consistent vigilance makes your home inhospitable to scorpions.

## When to Call a Professional Exterminator

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, scorpions persist. A severe infestation needs expert help. Knowing when to call a professional saves time and worry. Exterminators have tools and knowledge beyond what a homeowner can do.

You might need professional help if you see scorpions often. If you find them daily, or multiple times a week, you have a significant problem. This indicates scorpions are breeding inside your home. It means their living conditions are good.

If you cannot find the entry points or nests, an expert can. They use specialized equipment to locate hidden areas. They can also identify the specific scorpion species. This helps them choose the most effective treatment. Different scorpions may respond to different methods.

Professionals use stronger, more targeted chemicals. These products are not available to the public. They apply them safely and correctly. They know where to treat to get the best results. This can lead to a quicker and more complete eradication.

If anyone in your household has been stung, especially children or elderly persons, professional help is important. This ensures your home is truly safe. Do not risk repeated stings. A good exterminator provides peace of mind.

## What to Do If You Find a Scorpion in Your Bed

Finding a scorpion in your bed can be alarming. Stay calm. Panicking might lead to a sting. Your first goal is to remove the scorpion safely. Do not try to pick it up with your bare hand.

Use a long object like tongs or a broom to move it. You can also place a glass jar over the scorpion. Slide a piece of cardboard under the jar. This traps the scorpion inside. Then, carry it outside and release it far from your house. Ensure you wear thick gloves for extra safety if you need to touch the jar.

After removing the scorpion, check your bed carefully. Look under pillows and blankets. Inspect the mattress and bed frame. You can even check under the bed.

A thorough check ensures no others are hiding.

Re-evaluate your prevention methods. Did you miss a seal? Is there a new food source? Strengthen your defenses. This incident serves as a reminder to be diligent. It confirms the importance of regular checks.

If you are stung, seek medical attention. Clean the sting area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress. Watch for severe reactions like difficulty breathing or swelling throughout the body. Even if you are not sure it was a dangerous scorpion, a doctor can advise you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What attracts scorpions to homes?
Scorpions are drawn to homes primarily for shelter, especially during extreme weather. They seek out cool, dark, and moist places to hide during the day. They also enter homes in search of food. Their main diet consists of other insects like crickets, cockroaches, and spiders. Eliminating these pests makes your home less appealing.

### Are all scorpion stings dangerous?
No, not all scorpion stings are dangerous. Most scorpion stings are painful but cause only local symptoms, like swelling and redness. However, some species, particularly the Arizona Bark Scorpion, have venom that can cause severe symptoms. Always seek medical advice if stung, especially if it's a child or an older adult.

### How can I make my bed scorpion-proof without chemicals?
You can make your bed scorpion-proof without chemicals by creating physical barriers. Move your bed several inches away from the wall. Ensure no bedding touches the floor. Place glass jars or sticky traps under each bed leg. Regularly inspect your bed and surrounding areas before use. These steps create a safe zone.

### What is the best way to inspect my bed for scorpions?
The best way to inspect your bed for scorpions is to use a blacklight (UV flashlight) in the dark. Scorpions glow under UV light, making them easy to spot.

### How often should I check for scorpions in my home?
If you live in a scorpion-prone area, check your home for scorpions regularly. Perform a thorough inspection of your home's exterior and interior, especially at night with a blacklight, at least once a month.
