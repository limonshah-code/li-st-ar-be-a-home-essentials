### Takeaway

*   Prepare brinjal by washing, drying, and pricking the skin or cutting into pieces.
*   Brush brinjal with oil and season it well before cooking.
*   Use your convection microwave's convection mode for even roasting.
*   Set the temperature to 180°C-200°C (350°F-400°F) for optimal results.
*   Roast for 20-40 minutes, depending on brinjal size and desired tenderness.

To roast brinjal in a convection microwave, first, prepare the brinjal by pricking or chopping it. Then, coat it lightly with oil and your preferred seasonings. Place it on the microwave's metal rack in convection mode, typically set between 180°C to 200°C (350°F to 400°F), and roast for 20 to 40 minutes, turning halfway through, until it becomes tender.

### Understanding Your Convection Microwave for Roasting

A convection microwave is a versatile kitchen appliance. It combines the speed of a microwave oven with the browning and crisping capabilities of a convection oven. This makes it perfect for roasting vegetables like brinjal. Standard microwave ovens cook food using microwave radiation, heating water molecules quickly. This process excels at reheating and cooking certain foods but often results in a steamed texture rather than a roasted one. A convection microwave uses a heating element and a fan to circulate hot air inside the oven cavity. This hot air circulation cooks food evenly from all sides. It also creates a delicious, crispy exterior, mimicking a traditional oven.

When you roast brinjal in a convection microwave, you are primarily using the convection function. This means the hot air circulates around the brinjal, cooking it thoroughly and developing a beautiful roasted flavor and texture. Some models offer a "combi" mode, which combines convection heat with a short burst of microwave power. For pure roasting, I usually stick to the dedicated convection mode. It ensures consistent results. Different brands like [Samsung microwave convection ovens](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-samsung-microwave-convection-oven) or [Whirlpool microwave convection ovens](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-whirlpool-microwave-convection-oven) will have slightly different interfaces. However, the core principle of selecting convection mode and setting a temperature remains the same. Always refer to your appliance manual for specific instructions on selecting the convection mode and appropriate cookware. Remember, you can use metal bakeware in convection mode, but never in regular microwave mode. For more information on suitable cookware, you can learn [if you can put an aluminum pan in a convection oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-aluminum-pan-in-convection-oven).

### Choosing and Preparing Your Brinjal for Roasting

Selecting the right brinjal is the first step to successful roasting. Look for eggplants that feel firm and heavy for their size. Their skin should be smooth, shiny, and free of blemishes, soft spots, or wrinkles. A fresh brinjal will also have a vibrant green stem and cap. Avoid those with dull skin or a dried-up stem, as these indicate older produce. Smaller to medium-sized brinjals often have fewer seeds and less bitterness, making them ideal for roasting. Larger brinjals can be used, but they might require a bit more cooking time.

Once you have your brinjal, proper preparation is key. First, wash the brinjal thoroughly under cold running water. Pat it completely dry with a paper towel. Excess moisture can prevent browning and lead to steaming rather than roasting. Next, decide how you want to cut your brinjal. You have a few options, each suitable for different uses:

*   **Whole:** This method is excellent if you plan to make dishes like brinjal bharta or a smoky baba ghanoush. Prick the brinjal all over with a fork or a sharp knife a few times. This prevents it from bursting during cooking.
*   **Slices:** Cut the brinjal into ½ to ¾ inch thick rounds or half-moons. These are perfect for layering in dishes or serving as a side.
*   **Cubes:** Chop the brinjal into 1-inch to 1½-inch cubes. This is ideal for roasted vegetable medleys, curries, or stews.

After cutting, you might consider salting the brinjal. Some people believe this draws out bitterness and excess moisture. Simply sprinkle cut brinjal pieces with salt, let them sit for 15-30 minutes, then pat dry. I find that modern brinjal varieties are less bitter, so I often skip this step for general roasting. However, it can help achieve a firmer texture. Finally, drizzle your prepared brinjal with olive oil or another cooking oil. Toss to coat evenly. Season generously with salt, black pepper, and any other herbs or spices you prefer.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Roasting Brinjal

Roasting brinjal in your convection microwave is straightforward. Follow these steps for tender, flavorful results every time. It is a process similar to [how to roast other vegetables in a convection microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-roast-vegetables-in-convection-microwave), ensuring consistent cooking.

1.  **Preheat Your Convection Microwave:** Just like a conventional oven, preheating is crucial for even cooking and proper browning. Set your convection microwave to convection mode and preheat it to 180°C to 200°C (350°F to 400°F). The exact temperature can vary slightly based on your microwave's power and your desired level of tenderness and browning. I usually start at 200°C for quicker results.
2.  **Prepare the Brinjal:** As discussed, wash and dry your brinjal. Prick it if roasting whole, or cut it into slices or cubes. Toss the brinjal with a tablespoon or two of olive oil. Add salt, black pepper, and any other desired seasonings. Garlic powder, paprika, or Italian herbs work wonderfully. Ensure each piece is lightly coated.
3.  **Arrange Brinjal on the Rack:** Use the metal rack that comes with your convection microwave. Arrange the brinjal pieces in a single layer on the rack. Avoid overcrowding the rack, as this can lead to steaming instead of roasting. If you have a large amount of brinjal, roast it in batches. This ensures proper air circulation around each piece, which is essential for good roasting.
4.  **Place in the Convection Microwave:** Carefully place the metal rack with the brinjal into the preheated convection microwave. Ensure the door closes properly.
5.  **Set Cooking Time:**
    *   **For Whole Brinjal:** Roast for 30-45 minutes. The time depends on the size.
    *   **For Slices/Cubes:** Roast for 20-30 minutes.
    *   Begin checking for tenderness around the 20-minute mark.
6.  **Flip Halfway Through:** About halfway through the cooking time, carefully remove the rack. Use tongs to flip each brinjal piece. This promotes even browning on both sides. Return the rack to the microwave and continue roasting.
7.  **Check for Doneness:** The brinjal is ready when it is soft and tender when pierced with a fork. It should also have slightly browned, caramelized edges. If roasting whole, the skin might appear shriveled and the brinjal should feel very soft when squeezed. Adjust cooking time as needed. If it needs more browning, you can increase the temperature slightly for the last 5-10 minutes.

Once roasted, carefully remove the brinjal from the microwave. Let it cool slightly before handling. It is now ready to use in your favorite recipes or to enjoy as a simple side dish.

### Tips for Perfect Convection Microwave Brinjal Roasting

Achieving perfectly roasted brinjal in your convection microwave is easy with a few expert tips. These suggestions help ensure your brinjal comes out tender, flavorful, and beautifully caramelized every time. I have refined these techniques over many roasting sessions, and they consistently deliver excellent results.

*   **Don't Skimp on Oil:** Oil is crucial for proper roasting. It helps conduct heat, promotes browning, and prevents sticking. Use enough oil to lightly coat all surfaces of the brinjal. Olive oil is my preferred choice for its flavor and health benefits. You can also experiment with avocado oil or grapeseed oil.
*   **Season Generously:** Brinjal has a relatively mild flavor, so it absorbs seasonings well. Beyond salt and pepper, consider adding garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, thyme, rosemary, or a pinch of chili flakes for a kick. Experiment with different spice blends to match your meal.
*   **Single Layer is Key:** Always arrange brinjal in a single layer on the metal rack. Overcrowding leads to steaming because moisture gets trapped. Adequate space allows hot air to circulate freely around each piece. This circulation is what creates the desirable roasted texture and color. If you have a lot of brinjal, roast it in multiple batches.
*   **Preheat Fully:** Just like a conventional oven, a convection microwave needs to reach its set temperature before you place food inside. Preheating ensures an immediate blast of hot air, which helps achieve good browning from the start. Skipping this step can result in longer cooking times and less even roasting.
*   **Monitor and Adjust:** Cooking times are estimates. Your microwave's wattage, the brinjal's size, and even its water content can affect cooking time. Keep an eye on the brinjal, especially during the last 10-15 minutes. If it's browning too quickly, you can slightly reduce the temperature. If it's not browning enough, increase the temperature or cook a bit longer.
*   **Flip for Evenness:** Flipping the brinjal halfway through ensures both sides get exposed to the direct heat and circulating air. This results in uniform browning and tenderness. Use tongs to avoid burning your fingers.
*   **Achieving Extra Crispness:** If you want slightly crisper edges on your brinjal, similar to an air fryer texture, you can try finishing it with a higher temperature for the last few minutes, or even a short burst on a grill mode if your microwave has one. A convection microwave can sometimes mimic air frying results effectively. You can learn more about [how to use your convection microwave as an air fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-convection-microwave-as-air-fryer).
*   **Rest After Roasting:** While not strictly necessary, letting the roasted brinjal rest for a few minutes after removal allows the internal temperature to equalize. This makes the brinjal even more tender and succulent.

By following these tips, you will consistently achieve perfectly roasted brinjal that is tender, flavorful, and ready for your favorite dishes.
