### Understanding the Breville Smart Oven Pro's Core Features

The Breville Smart Oven Pro (BOV845BSS) is more than just a toaster oven. It is a sophisticated countertop appliance designed for various cooking needs. This oven offers multiple cooking functions, including toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, pizza, cookies, reheat, and warm. Its "Smart Oven" designation comes from its Element IQ system. This system directs power to heating elements as needed.

The oven has five independent quartz heating elements. These elements automatically adjust power for precise and stable cooking. This ensures your food cooks evenly from all sides. The key feature for air frying, however, is its powerful convection fan. This fan plays a central role in circulating hot air inside the oven.

The fan circulates heat around the food. This process cooks food faster and more evenly. It also helps create a crispy texture on the surface. This is the exact principle that air fryers use.

### The Convection Fan: Key to Air Frying Mimicry

Air frying works by circulating extremely hot air around food at high speed. This process cooks the food and creates a crispy, golden-brown exterior. The Breville Smart Oven Pro uses a powerful, two-speed convection fan for this purpose. When you select a cooking function like "Roast" or "Bake," the convection fan often engages. This fan pushes hot air all around your food.

This rapid air movement is crucial for "air frying" success. It removes moisture from the food's surface, promoting crispness. The Breville fan is strong enough to achieve significant browning and crisping. This feature allows the oven to simulate a dedicated air fryer's action. You get similar results without needing a separate appliance.

Think of it as a small, powerful convection oven. Most standalone air fryers are essentially compact convection ovens. The Breville Smart Oven Pro offers this capability on a larger scale.

### Achieving Air Fryer-Like Results with Your Breville Smart Oven Pro

Getting crispy "air fried" results from your Breville Smart Oven Pro requires a few specific techniques. First, use the "Roast" setting or a high "Bake" setting with the convection fan on. Temperatures typically range from 375°F to 425°F (190°C to 220°C). Always preheat the oven fully before adding food. This ensures immediate exposure to high, circulating heat.

Second, use the right accessories. The Breville Smart Oven Pro often comes with a wire rack and a baking pan. For best "air frying," place food directly on the wire rack. Put the baking pan underneath to catch drips. This setup allows air to circulate around all sides of the food. Avoid overcrowding the rack. Cook food in a single layer to ensure even crisping. Overlapping food will steam instead of fry.

Third, consider using a light coating of oil. A thin spray or toss with a teaspoon of oil helps achieve a golden, crispy finish. Flip or shake your food halfway through the cooking time. This ensures all sides get equal exposure to the hot air. By following these steps, you can achieve impressive crispiness for various foods.

### Optimal Foods for "Air Frying" in the Smart Oven Pro

The Breville Smart Oven Pro excels at "air frying" a wide range of foods. Frozen items like french fries, tater tots, chicken nuggets, and fish sticks cook beautifully. They come out golden and crunchy. Homemade items also do very well. Try chicken wings, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, or sweet potato fries. These foods benefit greatly from the circulating hot air.

For vegetables, a light toss with oil and seasonings before cooking yields fantastic results. The high heat creates a slightly charred, tender-crisp texture. Chicken pieces, especially wings and drumettes, become incredibly crispy on the outside while staying juicy inside. Even small batches of spring rolls or mozzarella sticks can be "air fried" to perfection.

Consider foods that benefit from high, dry heat. This cooking method helps achieve a desirable crispness. It reduces the need for excessive oil, making dishes healthier. The large capacity of the Breville Smart Oven Pro allows you to cook larger batches compared to many basket-style air fryers. This is great for family meals.

### Comparing Breville Smart Oven Pro to Dedicated Air Fryers

The Breville Smart Oven Pro offers significant advantages over many dedicated basket-style air fryers, but also has some differences. Its main benefit is versatility. It bakes, roasts, toasts, and "air fries," eliminating the need for multiple appliances. Its larger internal capacity often allows you to cook more food at once. This is perfect for families or entertaining. Dedicated air fryers often have smaller baskets, limiting batch sizes.

However, a dedicated air fryer might preheat faster due to its smaller cavity. It might also have specialized air frying programs. The Breville's convection fan is powerful, but a small, focused air fryer might achieve slightly faster crisping for certain items. Cleaning can also differ. For the Breville, you clean the interior and racks. For a basket air fryer, you often clean the basket and drawer. Learning how to properly [clean an air fryer oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-an-air-fryer-oven) will help maintain your Breville's performance.

Ultimately, the Breville Smart Oven Pro is an excellent multi-functional appliance. It provides very similar "air frying" capabilities. If you value counter space and versatility, the Breville is a superior choice. If your only goal is rapid air frying of small batches, a dedicated unit might offer a slight edge in speed.

### Maximizing Performance and Care of Your Breville Smart Oven Pro

To get the most out of your Breville Smart Oven Pro's "air frying" capabilities, proper maintenance is key. Regularly clean the interior, especially after cooking greasy foods. Grease buildup can affect heating efficiency and even cause odors. Wipe down the internal walls and the heating elements when cool. The crumb tray should be emptied frequently.

The wire rack and baking pan are critical for air circulation. Clean them thoroughly after each use. You can wash these by hand with warm, soapy water. For stubborn grease on the racks, consider soaking them first. Cleaning the oven's interior elements, especially the fan area, is important. For instance, knowing [how to clean an air fryer toaster oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-fryer-toaster-oven) provides good general guidance applicable here.

Always ensure good ventilation around your oven. This helps dissipate heat and moisture during cooking. Avoid blocking the fan vents. Proper care extends the life of your appliance. It also ensures consistent cooking performance, including its excellent "air frying" function. A well-maintained oven will always perform at its best.
