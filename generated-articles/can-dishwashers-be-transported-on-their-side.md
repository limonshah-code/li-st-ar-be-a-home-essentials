### Understanding Why Side Transport Is Risky for Dishwashers

You might think tilting a dishwasher is harmless, but it actually poses several risks. Dishwashers hold residual water in various places. They also contain essential fluids like oil in the pump and motor. When you transport a dishwasher on its side, these liquids can move to unintended areas. This can cause significant problems.

One major concern is water. Even after running a cycle, dishwashers retain some water. This water sits in the sump, drain hose, and water intake lines. If you tilt the appliance, this residual water can spill out. It might leak onto your vehicle's floor. Worse, it can seep into the dishwasher's electrical components. Water and electricity do not mix well. This can lead to short circuits, component corrosion, or even electrical failure. Always assume there is some water inside.

Another critical element is the motor and pump system. Many dishwasher motors use oil for lubrication. When the appliance is upright, this oil stays where it needs to be. When you lay it on its side, gravity pulls the oil. It can leak out of its housing. The oil can then contaminate other parts of the dishwasher. This includes the electrical wiring or sensors. An oil leak can cause mechanical failure. It can also create a fire hazard once the dishwasher is reconnected. This damage might not be visible at first glance.

Furthermore, internal components are not designed for side transport. The racks, spray arms, and cutlery baskets are made to sit securely when the dishwasher is upright. Tilting the appliance can cause these parts to shift violently. They can bang against the interior walls. This movement can bend, break, or dislodge them. You might end up with damaged racks or spray arms that no longer spin correctly. This impacts the dishwasher's cleaning performance. This is why understanding these risks is important for safe moving.

### Essential Preparations Before Moving Your Dishwasher

Proper preparation is the most important step for moving any appliance, especially a dishwasher. My experience tells me that rushing this stage often leads to damage. Taking the time to prepare thoroughly can save you a lot of trouble and expense. This is true whether you transport it upright or, if necessary, on its side.

First, you must disconnect the dishwasher from its power and water supplies. Always turn off the circuit breaker for the dishwasher at your home's main electrical panel. Then, unplug the appliance if it has a plug. For direct-wired models, a professional might be needed to safely disconnect the wiring. Next, turn off the water supply valve to the dishwasher. This valve is usually under the kitchen sink. Disconnect the water inlet hose from the valve and the dishwasher. Be prepared with towels and a bucket, as some water will certainly spill out.

Draining all residual water is critical. Even after disconnection, water remains in the hoses and the sump. Place a shallow pan or towels under the connections as you disconnect the hoses. Disconnect the drain hose from the garbage disposal or sink drain. Allow any remaining water to flow out into a bucket. Some dishwashers have a drain plug in the sump that you can remove to drain more water. You might want to run a short drain cycle on some models before disconnecting. This helps remove as much water as possible. Understanding [how dishwashers pump water out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-dishwashers-pump-water-out) can help you ensure thorough drainage.

Finally, secure all internal and external components. Remove any loose items like cutlery baskets. Use zip ties or strong tape to secure the upper and lower racks in place. Tape down the spray arms so they do not swing freely. Close the detergent dispenser and tape it shut. Tape the dishwasher door closed to prevent it from swinging open during transport. Wrap the hoses and power cord together and secure them to the back of the dishwasher. This prevents them from snagging or dragging. You might also want to wrap the entire appliance in moving blankets. These blankets protect the exterior from scratches and dents.

### The Preferred Method: Transporting Your Dishwasher Upright

For me, the safest way to move any dishwasher is always upright. This method keeps the appliance in its intended orientation. It minimizes risks of internal damage, leaks, and component shifts. Prioritizing upright transport ensures your dishwasher arrives at its new location ready for use.

Transporting upright helps maintain the integrity of the internal components. The motor and pump are designed to operate and sit in an upright position. Keeping the dishwasher vertical means the lubricating oil in the motor stays in its proper place. It prevents oil migration that can occur when the unit is on its side. This also prevents residual water from leaking into electrical parts. Water stays in the sump or hoses, where it is less likely to cause harm. The racks and spray arms also remain stable. They are less likely to dislodge or break when upright. This preserves the delicate internal structure of your appliance.

To move your dishwasher upright, you will need an appliance dolly. This specialized dolly has straps and often a stair climber feature. Slide the dolly under the front of the dishwasher. Carefully tilt the dishwasher back onto the dolly. Secure it tightly with the dolly's straps. Make sure the straps are snug but not overtight. They should hold the dishwasher firmly against the dolly's frame. This prevents it from shifting. An appliance dolly makes it easier to navigate stairs and uneven surfaces.

Once on the dolly, slowly roll the dishwasher to your transport vehicle. If using a moving truck with a ramp, push the dolly up the ramp carefully. In the truck, position the dishwasher against a sturdy wall. Use additional moving straps to secure it to the truck's anchor points. Prevent any movement during transit. Place padding or moving blankets around it. This protects it from other items in the truck. This setup ensures maximum stability. Compared to [transporting a dishwasher on its back](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-a-dishwasher-be-transported-on-its-back), upright transport is far superior for preventing issues. Taking these steps for upright transport vastly reduces the risk of damage.

### When Side Transport Is Unavoidable: Specific Precautions

Sometimes, upright transport simply is not an option. You might have a very narrow doorway. Perhaps your vehicle lacks the height for an upright appliance. In these rare cases, you might need to transport your dishwasher on its side. If you must transport your dishwasher on its side, certain precautions become absolutely vital. My advice is to approach this with extreme care to minimize potential damage.

First, identify which side is the safest to lay the dishwasher on. Generally, avoid placing it on the side with the control panel or the door hinges. The best option is often the side opposite the door or the non-hinged side. Some manufacturers might recommend a specific side in their manual. Always consult your dishwasher's user manual if available. This specific guide for [transporting a Bosch dishwasher on its side](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-a-bosch-dishwasher-be-transported-on-its-side) provides an example of brand-specific considerations. Understanding which side poses fewer risks to delicate components is key.

Before tilting, ensure you have drained every last drop of water. I cannot stress this enough. Even a small amount of residual water can wreak havoc if it reaches electrical components. Once you choose the side, lay the dishwasher down very slowly and carefully. Use at least two people for this task. Control the descent to prevent jarring impacts. Pad the area where it will rest with thick moving blankets or cardboard. This protects the exterior finish.

Once the dishwasher is on its side in the transport vehicle, secure it immediately. Use straps to tie it down firmly to prevent any movement. Even small shifts can cause internal parts to dislodge or bend. Place more padding around it, especially between the dishwasher and other items. This prevents scratches or dents during transit. Try to keep the transport time as short as possible. Minimize sudden stops or sharp turns. Drive smoothly to reduce vibrations and potential internal component stress. The less time it spends on its side, the better.

After transport, resist the urge to immediately install and use the dishwasher. You must allow it to sit upright for an extended period. This allows any displaced oil or water to settle back into its proper place. Experts typically recommend waiting at least 24 to 48 hours. This settling period is crucial for reducing the risk of motor damage or electrical shorts. Skipping this step can lead to immediate malfunction upon startup.

### Potential Damage from Incorrect Dishwasher Side Transport

Ignoring proper transport guidelines can lead to various problems for your dishwasher. These issues range from minor annoyances to complete appliance failure. I have seen many cases where improper side transport resulted in significant, costly damage. Understanding these potential problems can reinforce the importance of careful handling.

One immediate risk is water damage. If you do not thoroughly drain the dishwasher, residual water will certainly spill when tilted. This water can leak onto your vehicle's interior. More critically, it can seep into the dishwasher's sensitive electrical components. These include the control board, wiring, and motor. Water exposure can cause corrosion, short circuits, or outright failure of these parts. This often requires expensive repairs or even replacement of the entire unit. It can also create an electrical hazard, posing a risk of [can dishwashers start a fire](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-dishwashers-start-a-fire) if wiring is compromised.

Another serious concern is damage to the motor and pump. As mentioned earlier, the motor relies on lubricating oil. When the dishwasher is on its side, this oil can escape its housing. It can migrate to other parts, like electrical windings or the pump mechanism. This oil displacement can lead to motor burnout. It can also cause the pump to seize. This results in the dishwasher failing to fill or drain water correctly. This type of damage is often not repairable. It necessitates a new motor or pump assembly. These parts are very expensive.

Beyond the internal mechanisms, the physical components inside can also suffer. The racks, spray arms, and cutlery baskets are suspended. They are held in place when the dishwasher is upright. Laying the appliance on its side can cause these parts to shift violently. They can bend, break, or come completely loose. A broken spray arm will not distribute water effectively. Damaged racks make loading dishes difficult. Repairing or replacing these parts adds to your expense. It also causes inconvenience.

Finally, incorrect transport can void your dishwasher's warranty. Manufacturers design appliances for upright transport. They often state this in their manuals. If you transport it on its side and damage occurs, the manufacturer may argue that user error caused the problem. They might refuse to cover repairs under warranty. This leaves you responsible for the full cost of any issues. This risk alone makes careful transport a wise investment of your time and effort.

### Post-Transport Care and Installation Tips

After the stress of moving, your dishwasher needs some careful attention before it gets back to work. Rushing the installation process can undo all your careful efforts during transport. I always recommend a period of rest for the appliance. This ensures everything settles back into place properly.

The most important step after transporting a dishwasher, especially if it was on its side, is to let it sit upright. This settling period is crucial. It allows any displaced oil in the motor to drain back into its proper reservoir. It also allows any residual water that might have seeped into unintended areas to evaporate. The general recommendation is to let the dishwasher sit upright for at least 24 to 48 hours. This waiting period helps prevent potential electrical shorts or motor damage upon startup. It is a simple step that provides significant peace of mind.

Once the settling period is over, you can begin the installation process. First, carefully inspect the dishwasher for any visible signs of damage. Check for new leaks, bent hoses, or loose electrical connections. If you notice anything unusual, address it before proceeding. Then, reconnect the water inlet hose to the water supply valve and the dishwasher. Ensure all connections are hand-tight. You might need to use a wrench for a final snug fit, but do not overtighten. Overtightening can strip threads or damage seals.

Next, reconnect the drain hose to your sink drain or garbage disposal. Make sure the hose forms a high loop. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Secure the drain hose connection with a clamp. Finally, reconnect the power. If it is a plug-in model, plug it into the outlet. If it is direct-wired, ensure the wiring is secure and correctly installed before turning on the circuit breaker. Be mindful of the [power dishwashers use](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-power-do-dishwashers-use) and ensure your circuit can handle it.

Before loading dishes, run a test cycle. Fill the dishwasher with a small amount of water or a dishwasher cleaning solution. This helps to flush out any air in the lines and check for leaks. During the cycle, carefully observe the connections for any drips or puddles. Listen for unusual noises. If everything seems normal and there are no leaks, your dishwasher is likely ready for regular use. If you spot problems, turn off the power and water. Then, investigate the issue or call a professional.
