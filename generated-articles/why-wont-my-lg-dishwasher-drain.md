## Troubleshooting Your LG Dishwasher: Why It Won't Drain

A dishwasher that will not drain leaves dirty, stagnant water in the tub. This is frustrating. If you have an LG dishwasher, you might wonder why it stopped draining properly. I know how irritating this can be. Dirty dishes pile up, and the kitchen smells bad. Finding the cause helps you fix the problem fast.

This article will explain why your LG dishwasher won't drain. We will look at common reasons like clogs and faulty parts. You will learn how to diagnose these issues. I will also provide clear steps to fix them. Our goal is to get your LG dishwasher draining again.

### Takeaway

*   Check the air gap and drain hose for clogs first.
*   Clean the drain filter and sump area regularly.
*   Inspect the garbage disposal connection if applicable.
*   Test the drain pump for power and function.
*   Look for error codes to guide your diagnosis.

When your LG dishwasher won't drain, it usually points to a clog in the drain system, a problem with the drain pump, or an issue with the float switch. Food debris, grease, or a kinked hose are frequent culprits that stop proper water removal.

## Common Reasons Your LG Dishwasher Won't Drain

Many factors can stop an LG dishwasher from draining. It is important to check the most common issues first. These often include blockages in the drain system. Other times, a component like the drain pump might fail. I always start with the simplest checks. This saves time and avoids unnecessary repairs.

Your LG dishwasher needs a clear path for water to exit. Any obstruction along this path will cause drainage problems. This path includes the filter, drain hose, air gap, and sink drain. Even a small piece of food can cause a big problem. Understanding these common reasons helps you pinpoint the exact issue.

### Clogged Dishwasher Filter

The dishwasher filter stops food particles from entering the drain pump. Over time, these particles build up on the filter. A dirty filter blocks water from reaching the drain pump. This means water stays in the tub. You should clean your LG dishwasher filter often. It is a simple task that prevents many drainage issues.

Cleaning the filter is easy. First, open the dishwasher door. Locate the filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. Twist it or lift it out. Rinse it under running water. Use a soft brush to remove any stuck-on debris. You can also refer to [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain) for more general steps. Make sure to put the filter back correctly after cleaning. A loose filter will not work properly. Regular cleaning helps keep your LG dishwasher draining well.

### Blocked Drain Hose

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. This hose can become blocked. Food debris, grease, or even small objects can get stuck inside. A kink or bend in the hose also stops water flow. This is a common reason why an LG dishwasher won't drain.

To check the drain hose, first disconnect the dishwasher from power. Pull the dishwasher out from its space. Inspect the hose for visible kinks or damage. You can also disconnect the hose from the sink drain or disposal. Look inside with a flashlight for blockages. You might need to use a drain snake or a long brush to clear stubborn clogs. Ensure the hose has a proper high loop. A low loop can cause siphoning issues. You can find more details about fixing specific drainage issues in your LG dishwasher by checking [how to fix an LG dishwasher that won't drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-an-lg-dishwasher-that-wont-drain).

### Clogged Air Gap or Sink Drain

Many dishwashers connect to an air gap on your sink. This device prevents contaminated sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If the air gap gets clogged, water cannot drain properly. The air gap needs to be clear for the dishwasher to work.

Your sink drain or garbage disposal can also cause drainage problems for your LG dishwasher. If the sink drain is clogged, water from the dishwasher has nowhere to go. Always check your sink drain if your dishwasher has drainage issues. Run water in the sink. If it drains slowly, the problem might be in the sink line. If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, ensure the disposal is empty. Run the disposal before starting the dishwasher. Make sure the knockout plug was removed when installing the dishwasher.

## Inspecting the Drain Pump and Sump Area

The drain pump is a key part of your LG dishwasher's drainage system. It pushes water out of the dishwasher. If the pump is faulty, water will not drain. The sump area is where water collects before being pumped out. This area also needs to be clear of debris. These components are vital for proper drainage.

I always recommend checking the drain pump and sump area when an LG dishwasher won't drain. This often requires removing the lower spray arm and filter. Taking these steps allows you to see if anything is blocking the pump impeller. Sometimes, a small object like a broken glass shard or a twist tie can jam the pump.

### Checking for Obstructions in the Sump Area

The sump is the lowest part of the dishwasher tub. Water gathers here before the drain pump activates. Food debris, broken glass, or small objects can collect in the sump. These items can block the pump's impeller or the filter. This prevents water from draining out.

To check the sump area:

1.  **Disconnect power:** Unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker. This is crucial for safety.
2.  **Remove racks and spray arm:** Take out the bottom dish rack. Remove the lower spray arm by unscrewing or unlatching it.
3.  **Remove filter:** Locate and remove the filter assembly. This usually involves twisting and lifting it.
4.  **Inspect the sump:** Use a flashlight to look into the sump area. Check for any visible debris.
5.  **Clear obstructions:** Carefully remove any food particles, broken glass, or other foreign objects. Wear gloves to protect your hands. Ensure nothing is caught around the drain opening.
6.  **Reassemble:** Put the filter, spray arm, and racks back.

A clear sump ensures water can reach the drain pump without issues.

### Testing the Drain Pump Motor

If the sump is clear, the drain pump itself might be the problem. The drain pump has a motor that spins an impeller. This impeller pushes water out. If the motor is faulty or the impeller is jammed, the LG dishwasher won't drain. A humming noise without water movement often indicates a jammed or failing pump.

To test the drain pump:

1.  **Disconnect power:** Always turn off power before working on electrical components.
2.  **Access the pump:** The drain pump is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher, often accessible from the front or side. You might need to tilt the dishwasher or slide it out.
3.  **Inspect wiring:** Check that all wires connecting to the pump are secure. Loose connections can prevent the pump from getting power.
4.  **Check for jammed impeller:** Some pumps have an access port. You might be able to feel the impeller. Try to turn it manually. It should spin freely. Remove any visible obstructions.
5.  **Test for continuity (advanced):** Use a multimeter to check the pump motor for electrical continuity. If there is no continuity, the motor is likely bad.
6.  **Test for power:** With power reconnected (briefly and carefully), check if the pump receives voltage when it should be draining. This requires a multimeter and caution.
7.  **Consider replacement:** If the pump motor fails tests or remains jammed, it needs replacement. You can find specific instructions on [how to test LG dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-lg-dishwasher-drain-pump).

Replacing a drain pump can be a complex task. If you are unsure, consider calling a professional.

## Electrical and Sensor Issues Affecting Drainage

Beyond clogs and mechanical failures, electrical problems or faulty sensors can prevent your LG dishwasher from draining. These issues can be harder to diagnose without technical knowledge. However, some basic checks are possible. I always consider these possibilities if the obvious mechanical problems are not present.

The dishwasher's control board sends signals to components like the drain pump. Sensors, like the float switch, tell the control board about water levels. If these electrical signals or sensor readings are incorrect, the dishwasher might not initiate a drain cycle.

### Faulty Float Switch

The float switch is a safety device. It prevents the dishwasher from overflowing. When water fills the tub, a float rises. This float activates a switch. The switch tells the control board the water level. If the float switch gets stuck in the "full" position, the dishwasher thinks there is too much water. It will not start the wash cycle or drain cycle to prevent overflowing. This is a common reason why an LG dishwasher won't drain.

To check the float switch:

1.  **Disconnect power:** Always unplug the dishwasher first.
2.  **Locate the float:** The float is a small plastic cup or cylinder. It is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, near the front.
3.  **Inspect for obstructions:** Make sure the float moves freely up and down. Food debris or other objects can get stuck under it. Clear any obstructions.
4.  **Test the switch (advanced):** Access the float switch from underneath the dishwasher. Disconnect the wires. Use a multimeter to test for continuity. When the float is down, the switch should be open (no continuity). When the float is pushed up, it should be closed (continuity). If it does not change, the switch is bad.
5.  **Replace if faulty:** A faulty float switch needs replacement.

A malfunctioning float switch can give false readings, confusing the control board.

### Control Board Malfunction

The control board is the "brain" of your LG dishwasher. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the signal to drain. This means the drain pump will not activate. A control board issue can be tricky to diagnose. There are no easy visual cues.

Signs of a control board malfunction can include:

*   Dishwasher not responding to commands.
*   Random error codes appearing.
*   Components not activating (like the drain pump) even after checking them.
*   Lights on the control panel flashing erratically.

Testing a control board requires specific tools and expertise. It is often a last resort diagnosis. If you suspect the control board, it is usually best to call a qualified appliance technician. Replacing a control board is expensive. Make sure you rule out all other possibilities first. Some general LG dishwasher issues, such as [why won't my LG dishwasher turn off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-lg-dishwasher-turn-off) or [why won't my LG dishwasher power on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-lg-dishwasher-power-on), can also relate to control board problems.

### Door Latch Issues

While less direct, a faulty door latch can sometimes prevent an LG dishwasher from draining. The door latch has a sensor. This sensor tells the control board if the door is fully closed and latched. For safety, the dishwasher will not operate if the door is open or not latched properly. This includes the drain cycle.

If the latch is broken or the sensor is faulty, the dishwasher might not start any cycle. It might appear to be full of water and unable to drain. Make sure the door clicks firmly into place. Inspect the latch for visible damage. You can try to reset the dishwasher by turning off its power for a few minutes. If the latch is clearly broken, it needs replacement. This ensures the dishwasher gets the correct signal to operate all functions, including drainage.

## External Plumbing Connections and Obstructions

Sometimes, the reason your LG dishwasher won't drain has nothing to do with the dishwasher itself. The problem lies in your home's plumbing. The dishwasher drains into your sink's plumbing system. This connection can become a source of drainage issues. I always check the external plumbing if the dishwasher components seem fine. It is a common oversight.

Ensuring your sink drain, garbage disposal, and the dishwasher's connection to them are clear is important. A slow-draining sink can cause water to back up into the dishwasher. This makes it look like the dishwasher is not draining.

### Garbage Disposal Connection

Many LG dishwashers drain into a garbage disposal unit. If you have a new garbage disposal, ensure the knockout plug is removed. This plug is inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet port. If it is not removed, water cannot flow from the dishwasher. This is a very common installation mistake.

Even if the knockout plug was removed, the disposal itself can clog. Food waste can build up inside the disposal. If the disposal is full or jammed, it will not allow dishwasher water to pass through. Always run your garbage disposal before starting the dishwasher. This clears any food debris. If your garbage disposal is making a humming sound but not grinding, it might be jammed. You need to clear the jam for the dishwasher to drain. You can usually clear a jam by inserting an Allen wrench into the center hole at the bottom of the disposal. Turn it back and forth to free the impellers.

### Clogged Sink Drain

The sink drain is the final destination for the dishwasher's wastewater. If your kitchen sink drains slowly, or not at all, the dishwasher will also have drainage problems. The water has nowhere to go. It will back up into the dishwasher tub. This makes your LG dishwasher appear to be faulty.

To check your sink drain:

*   Fill your kitchen sink with some water.
*   Pull the stopper.
*   Observe how quickly the water drains.

If the water drains slowly, your sink drain is clogged. You need to clear this clog first. You can try a plunger, baking soda and vinegar, or a chemical drain cleaner. For tough clogs, you might need a drain snake. Once the sink drains freely, your LG dishwasher might start draining normally. It is important to fix the root problem in the plumbing.

### High Loop in Drain Hose

A crucial part of dishwasher installation is creating a "high loop" in the drain hose. This means routing the drain hose up high under the sink, above the connection point to the sink drain or garbage disposal. The hose then comes back down to connect. This high loop prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It also prevents siphoning, where the dishwasher drains continuously even when not running a cycle.

If your LG dishwasher drain hose does not have a high loop, or if the loop has fallen, water can back up or drain poorly. Check the installation of your drain hose under the sink. Ensure it forms a high arch. You can secure it with a clamp or strap if needed. This simple check can resolve persistent drainage issues. Proper installation is key for reliable dishwasher operation.

## Understanding LG Dishwasher Error Codes

LG dishwashers often display error codes when there is a problem. These codes are very helpful. They give you a hint about what is wrong with the appliance. If your LG dishwasher won't drain, check the display panel for any codes. These codes can point you directly to the cause.

I find that consulting the user manual is the best first step when an error code appears. The manual explains what each code means. Understanding these codes saves you time troubleshooting. It also helps you decide if you can fix the problem yourself or if you need professional help.

### Common Drainage-Related Error Codes

Several LG dishwasher error codes relate directly to drainage issues. Knowing these codes helps you diagnose the problem faster. Here are some common ones:

*   **OE (Water Outlet Error):** This is the most common error code for drainage problems. It means the dishwasher is having trouble draining water. The OE code often indicates a clogged filter, drain hose, or a problem with the drain pump. It can also signal a faulty water level sensor or a blockage in the sump area. If you see an OE code, start by checking the filter, drain hose, and sump for obstructions.
*   **IE (Water Inlet Error):** While primarily an inlet error, a long-standing inlet problem can indirectly affect drainage. If the dishwasher cannot fill properly, it might get stuck in a cycle and not complete or drain. However, for a direct "won't drain" issue, OE is more relevant.
*   **LE (Leak Error):** This code means the dishwasher detected a leak. While not directly a drainage issue, a leak can activate the flood sensor. The dishwasher might then try to drain the water from the pan or stop its cycle. This prevents further leaks. You might also need to know [how to empty LG dishwasher drain pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-empty-lg-dishwasher-drain-pan) in this scenario. If the drain pan underneath the unit fills with water, the leak sensor activates, stopping all operations.

Always check your LG dishwasher user manual for the exact meaning of error codes. Models can vary.

### How to Reset Your LG Dishwasher

Sometimes, an error code or a minor glitch can cause your LG dishwasher to stop draining. A simple reset can clear these temporary issues. This is always worth trying before digging into more complex diagnostics. It's like restarting a computer when it acts up.

To reset your LG dishwasher:

1.  **Turn off power:** Locate the circuit breaker for your dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position. If you can easily access the power cord, unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet.
2.  **Wait:** Leave the power off for at least 5-10 minutes. This allows the control board to fully discharge and clear any temporary memory errors.
3.  **Restore power:** Turn the circuit breaker back on or plug the dishwasher back in.
4.  **Test:** Try running a short drain cycle or a normal wash cycle. See if the dishwasher now drains properly.

A reset can resolve many common issues, including an LG dishwasher that won't drain due to a simple electronic hiccup. If the error code returns, or the problem persists, then you need to investigate further based on the error code or other symptoms.

## Advanced Troubleshooting and Professional Help

After checking the common clogs and performing basic resets, you might still have an LG dishwasher that won't drain. At this point, the issue could be more complex. It might involve internal components or require specific tools. I advise caution when dealing with electrical parts. Safety is always important.

Knowing when to call a professional is crucial. While many issues are DIY-friendly, some problems are best left to experts. This ensures proper repair and avoids causing more damage to your appliance.

### Diagnosing a Faulty Check Valve

The check valve is a small, one-way valve in the drain line. It prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher tub after it has drained. If the check valve gets stuck or malfunctions, it can prevent water from leaving the dishwasher. It acts like a gate that won't open.

To check the check valve:

1.  **Disconnect power:** Unplug the dishwasher.
2.  **Access the drain hose connection:** The check valve is typically located where the drain hose connects to the drain pump or the dishwasher's sump. You might need to pull the dishwasher out and remove a panel.
3.  **Inspect the valve:** Some check valves are simple flappers. Others are small ball valves. Look for any debris preventing the valve from opening or closing. Ensure it can move freely.
4.  **Clean or replace:** If it's clogged, clean it thoroughly. If it's broken or not moving, it needs replacement.

A faulty check valve is less common than a clogged filter or hose. However, it can certainly cause an LG dishwasher not to drain.

### When to Consider Professional Repair

You have tried all the steps. You have checked for clogs. You tested the pump. The LG dishwasher still won't drain. This is when it is time to call a professional. Appliance repair technicians have specialized tools and knowledge. They can diagnose problems you might miss.

Consider professional help if:

*   **You are uncomfortable:** Working with electricity or complex appliance parts can be risky. If you are not confident, do not proceed.
*   **Problem persists:** After trying all troubleshooting steps, the dishwasher still won't drain.
*   **Error code is complex:** Some error codes point to internal component failures that require specialized diagnostics.
*   **Suspect a major part:** If you suspect the drain pump motor or the control board is bad, replacement can be costly and challenging. A professional can confirm the diagnosis.
*   **Under warranty:** If your LG dishwasher is still under warranty, contact LG customer service. DIY repairs might void the warranty.

A professional can quickly identify the problem. They can order the correct parts and install them properly. This saves you frustration and potential further damage. Remember, a broken LG dishwasher that won't drain is fixable. It just needs the right approach.

## Maintenance Tips to Prevent Drainage Issues

Preventing problems is better than fixing them. Regular maintenance can keep your LG dishwasher draining smoothly. These simple habits can save you a lot of trouble. I believe in proactive care for all appliances. This helps them last longer and perform better.

Keeping your dishwasher clean is the most important step. Food particles are the main cause of drainage clogs. A little effort each week can prevent bigger problems later. These tips apply to any dishwasher, but especially to your LG dishwasher.

### Regularly Clean the Dishwasher Filter

This is the most crucial maintenance step. The filter catches food debris. If it gets clogged, water cannot drain. Many LG dishwasher models have a self-cleaning filter, but even these need manual cleaning sometimes. Other models have manual filters that need regular attention.

My routine is simple:

1.  **Remove the filter:** Twist or unlatch the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.
2.  **Rinse under water:** Hold it under running water to wash away loose debris.
3.  **Brush stubborn spots:** Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to remove stuck-on food. Dish soap can help with grease.
4.  **Reinstall:** Place the filter back correctly. Ensure it clicks into place.

I clean my filter every few weeks. If you do many greasy loads or have a large family, clean it more often. A clean filter is your best defense against your LG dishwasher not draining.

### Scrape Dishes Before Loading

Pre-rinsing dishes is often not needed with modern dishwashers. However, scraping large food particles off plates is always a good idea. Large chunks of food, bones, or even sticky labels can block the filter or drain pump. They are too big for the dishwasher to handle.

Make sure to remove:

*   Large food scraps (e.g., bones, corn cobs)
*   Excess grease (e.g., from deep frying)
*   Stickers or labels from new dishes
*   Toothpicks or other small, hard items

These items are notorious for causing clogs in the drain system. They can get past the filter and jam the drain pump. Taking an extra second to scrape your plates saves you from future drainage headaches. This small step significantly reduces the chances of your LG dishwasher not draining.

### Use a Dishwasher Cleaner Periodically

Even with clean filters and scraped dishes, mineral deposits and grease can build up over time. These can accumulate in the pipes, pump, and drain hose. They can slowly restrict water flow. A dishwasher cleaner helps break down these deposits.

I use a dishwasher cleaner every one to three months. You can buy commercial dishwasher cleaners. Some use citric acid or bleach. Always follow the product instructions. Generally, you run an empty dishwasher cycle with the cleaner. This helps flush out any hidden gunk.

Alternatively, you can use:

*   **White Vinegar:** Place a cup of white vinegar in an open, top-rack-safe bowl. Run a hot, empty cycle.
*   **Baking Soda:** Sprinkle a cup of baking soda on the bottom of the dishwasher. Run a short, hot cycle.

These natural cleaners help remove odors and break down residue. Regular use prevents buildup that could cause your LG dishwasher to stop draining.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: How do I manually drain my LG dishwasher?

To manually drain your LG dishwasher, first disconnect its power. Remove the bottom rack and filter assembly. Use a cup or towel to scoop out standing water from the tub. Be careful with any broken glass. You can then check the sump area for debris. This method removes water but does not fix the underlying drainage issue.

### Q2: What LG error codes mean a drainage issue?

The most common LG dishwasher error code for drainage issues is "OE" (Water Outlet Error). This code directly indicates a problem with water draining from the unit. Other less direct codes like "LE" (Leak Error) can also be related, as a leak might stop the drain cycle to prevent overflowing.

### Q3: Can a clogged air gap stop my LG dishwasher from draining?

Yes, a clogged air gap can definitely stop your LG dishwasher from draining. The air gap acts as a vent for the drain hose. If food debris or grease clogs it, water cannot flow out properly. This causes water to back up into the dishwasher tub or even into the sink.

### Q4: How often should I clean my LG dishwasher filter?

You should clean your LG dishwasher filter regularly. For most households, cleaning it once every few weeks is sufficient. If you use your dishwasher frequently, or if you do not scrape food off dishes before loading, you may need to clean it weekly. Regular cleaning prevents clogs.

### Q5: Is it safe to use chemical drain cleaners in an LG dishwasher?

Using strong chemical drain cleaners directly in your LG dishwasher is generally not recommended. These chemicals can damage plastic and rubber components inside the appliance.
