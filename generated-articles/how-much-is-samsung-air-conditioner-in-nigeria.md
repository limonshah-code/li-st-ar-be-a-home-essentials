Learn [how to clean your air conditioner filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-conditioner-filter) for optimal performance. Neglecting this leads to reduced airflow and higher energy consumption.
*   **Professional Servicing:** A professional service (general cleaning and check-up) is recommended every 6-12 months. This costs between NGN 10,000 and NGN 25,000 per unit. Technicians clean coils, check refrigerant levels, and ensure all components work correctly. Neglecting professional cleaning can cause your AC to become less efficient. It can even lead to issues like your [Samsung air conditioner not cooling](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-air-conditioner-not-cooling) properly.
*   **Refrigerant Top-Up:** If your AC is not cooling effectively, it might need a refrigerant top-up. This is usually done during professional servicing. It can cost NGN 15,000 - NGN 30,000, depending on the refrigerant type (R22 vs. R410A) and quantity needed.
*   **Repairs:** If a component fails, repair costs vary widely. Common repairs might include capacitor replacement (NGN 10,000 - NGN 25,000) or sensor replacement (NGN 8,000 - NGN 18,000). Major repairs like compressor replacement can be very expensive, sometimes approaching the cost of a new unit. Regular maintenance helps prevent such breakdowns. Knowing [how to clean an air conditioner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-conditioner) properly helps.

Overall, consider the total cost of ownership: purchase price + installation + running costs + maintenance. An inverter AC, despite higher initial cost, often provides better value long-term due to lower electricity bills.
