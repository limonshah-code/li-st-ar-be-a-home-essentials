They integrate well with smart home thermostats, allowing for precise control and scheduling, which further optimizes energy use.

### How an E Heat Pump Works: The Science of Heat Transfer

An E Heat Pump operates on a simple scientific principle: heat transfer. It uses a refrigerant that changes state from liquid to gas and back again. This cycle moves heat from one place to another. This is the core of how the system provides both heating and cooling for your home. It does not create heat; it simply moves it.

Imagine a refrigerator. It moves heat from inside the fridge to your kitchen. A heat pump does something similar, but on a larger scale. In heating mode, the outdoor coil acts like an evaporator. It absorbs heat from the outside air, even when it is cold. The refrigerant then carries this heat indoors. The indoor coil then acts as a condenser. It releases the heat into your home's air. The fan then distributes this warm air throughout your living space.

#### Heating Mode Explained

When your E Heat Pump is in heating mode, the outdoor unit pulls warmth from the air. Even air that feels cold still contains some heat energy. The refrigerant inside the coils absorbs this heat. A compressor then increases the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant. This hot, high-pressure gas travels to the indoor unit. There, it condenses back into a liquid, releasing its heat into your home. The cycle then repeats, continuously warming your living spaces.

#### Cooling Mode Explained

When it is hot outside, your E Heat Pump switches to cooling mode. The cycle reverses. The indoor coil now absorbs heat from your home's air. The refrigerant carries this heat outdoors. The outdoor coil releases the heat into the outside air. The system effectively acts like an air conditioner, removing heat and humidity from your indoor environment. This dual functionality is one of the main advantages of an E Heat Pump. It means you only need one system for year-round comfort.
