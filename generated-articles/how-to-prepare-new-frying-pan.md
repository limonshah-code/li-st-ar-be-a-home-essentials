5.  **Repeat:** For best results, repeat the oiling and baking process 3-4 more times. Each layer builds up the non-stick surface. This process makes your cast iron pan ready for cooking.

After seasoning, your pan is ready to use. Continue to build up the seasoning layer with regular use and proper cleaning. When you need to clean cast iron after cooking, use gentle methods. For tough spots, you might need to clean the pan thoroughly. [How to clean frying pan burnt](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-frying-pan-burnt) food can be a challenge.

### Conditioning Non-Stick Frying Pans for First Use

Non-stick pans do not need seasoning. They have a factory-applied coating. However, a quick conditioning step helps prolong the life of this coating. This process helps you prepare new frying pan for optimal performance. It is simple and takes little time.

**Steps for Conditioning:**

1.  **Initial Clean:** Wash the non-stick pan with warm, soapy water and a soft sponge. Rinse well and dry completely.
2.  **Light Oil Application:** Pour one tablespoon of vegetable oil or similar cooking oil into the pan. Spread the oil evenly over the entire interior surface using a paper towel.
3.  **Gentle Heat:** Place the pan on the stove over low to medium heat for 30-60 seconds. The goal is to gently warm the oil. Do not let the oil smoke.
4.  **Cool and Wipe:** Remove the pan from heat. Let it cool down completely. Once cool, wipe out any excess oil with a clean paper towel. The pan should feel smooth and clean, not greasy.

Your non-stick pan is now ready for its first cooking adventure. Remember to use wooden, silicone, or plastic utensils to protect the coating. Avoid metal utensils. To clean non-stick pans after use, use warm water and mild soap.
