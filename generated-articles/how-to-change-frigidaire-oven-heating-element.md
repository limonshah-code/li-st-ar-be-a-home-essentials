Changing a Frigidaire oven heating element requires you to disconnect power, access the oven's interior, unscrew the old element, disconnect its wires, and then reverse these steps to install the new part. This repair is simple and can restore your oven's full heating capability quickly.

## Understanding Your Frigidaire Oven Heating Element

Your Frigidaire oven relies on heating elements for proper function. Most electric ovens have two main elements. The bake element is at the bottom. It provides the main heat for baking. The broil element is at the top. It provides intense heat for broiling.

These elements are simple parts. They contain a wire that heats up when electricity flows through it. Over time, these wires can break or wear out. This causes the element to stop working. Recognizing which element is faulty helps you focus your repair efforts.

### Common Signs of a Bad Heating Element

Several signs point to a failing heating element. Your oven might not heat up at all. It might heat unevenly, leaving some parts of your food raw. Sometimes, the element will show visible damage. You might see cracks or blisters on its surface.

A visible break in the coil is a clear indicator. You may also notice the element does not glow red when the oven is on. If your oven light works but the heat does not, the element is a likely culprit. These symptoms guide you towards checking the elements.

## Diagnosing a Faulty Frigidaire Oven Heating Element

Before you replace anything, confirm the heating element is the problem. This saves you time and money. Start by visually inspecting both elements. Look for any breaks, bulges, or discolored spots. A healthy element should look smooth and uniform.

Next, turn on your oven to the bake setting. Watch the bake element. It should glow red evenly within a few minutes. Do the same for the broil element. If either element does not glow or glows only in spots, it is likely faulty. This visual check is often enough.

### Using a Multimeter for Accurate Diagnosis

A multimeter offers a more precise test. This tool measures electrical resistance. First, unplug your oven from the power outlet. Access the element's terminals. These are usually at the back of the oven. Disconnect the wires from the element.

Set your multimeter to the ohms (Î©) setting. Place one probe on each terminal of the heating element. A working element will show a resistance reading between 10 and 50 ohms. If the multimeter shows "OL" (over limit) or infinity, the element is open. This means the circuit is broken, and the element is bad. This step confirms your visual diagnosis.

## Essential Tools and Parts for Your Oven Repair

Gathering all your tools before starting makes the repair smooth. You do not want to stop midway to find a missing item. The right tools ensure safety and efficiency. Having the correct replacement part is also crucial for success.

### Tools You Will Need

You will need a few basic hand tools for this job. A Phillips head screwdriver is essential for most oven screws. A nut driver or socket set might be needed for specific fasteners. Pliers can help with stubborn wire connections. You will also need a pair of wire strippers if you need to repair any damaged wires. A flashlight is helpful for seeing into dark corners of the oven. Finally, a voltage tester or multimeter confirms the power is off.

### Obtaining the Correct Replacement Element

This is a critical step. An incorrect part will not fit or work properly. Locate your Frigidaire oven's model number. This is usually on a sticker around the oven door frame. It can also be found on the back of the range. Write down the full model number.

Use this model number to search for the specific replacement heating element. You can find this part online through appliance parts retailers or from Frigidaire directly. Ensure the new element matches the shape and specifications of your old one. Some general advice on [how to replace an electric oven heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-electric-oven-heating-element) might be helpful, but always prioritize the Frigidaire-specific part. Buying the exact element ensures a perfect fit.

## Prioritizing Safety Before Starting Your Oven Repair

Safety is paramount when working with electrical appliances. An electric oven carries significant voltage. Ignoring safety steps can lead to severe injury or electrical shock. Never skip these precautions. Take your time to ensure everything is safe.

### Disconnecting the Power Supply

This is the most important step. You must completely disconnect the oven from its power source. For most electric ranges, this means unplugging it from the wall outlet. Pull the range out from the wall to access the cord. If your oven is hardwired, you must turn off the circuit breaker that controls the oven. This breaker is usually in your home's main electrical panel.

I always recommend double-checking the power is off. Use a voltage tester to confirm no current is flowing to the element terminals. This simple check protects you from accidental electrocution. Do not begin work until you are certain the power is off.

### Protecting Your Workspace and Yourself

Wear gloves to protect your hands. Oven interiors can have sharp edges. Move the oven away from the wall to create enough space to work. Lay down a blanket or cardboard to protect your floor. This also provides a softer surface if you need to kneel.

Keep children and pets away from the work area. They can accidentally bump into the oven or tools. Have good lighting, such as a flashlight, to clearly see the wires and connections inside the oven. These small steps ensure a safe working environment.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Removing the Old Frigidaire Heating Element

Removing the old element is a straightforward process. It involves a few screws and wire disconnections. Take your time with each step. This prevents damage to other parts of the oven. A systematic approach helps.

### Accessing the Element and Removing Fasteners

First, open your oven door wide. Remove the oven racks to give yourself clear access. Locate the heating element you need to replace. The bake element is on the bottom. The broil element is on the top. Most elements are held in place by two screws at the back of the oven interior. Some older models might have additional clips or brackets.

Use your Phillips head screwdriver or nut driver to remove these screws. Keep them in a safe place. You will reuse them for the new element. As you loosen the screws, the element might start to come free. Do not pull it out entirely yet. It is still connected by wires.

### Disconnecting the Wires

Once the screws are out, gently pull the element forward a few inches. This will expose the electrical wires connected to its terminals. These wires supply power to the element. Each terminal usually has one wire connected. Some ovens use spade connectors that simply pull off. Others might have nuts holding the wires in place. You can refer to guides on [how to remove a GE oven heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-ge-oven-heating-element) for similar wire connection types, though specific wire colors or terminal designs might vary slightly between brands.

Carefully disconnect each wire from its terminal. Pay attention to which wire goes to which terminal if they are not identical. Taking a photo with your phone is a good idea. This helps ensure correct reinstallation. Be careful not to let the wires retract into the oven wall cavity. They can sometimes snap back into the insulation. You can gently clip them to the oven frame or use tape to secure them temporarily. Now, you can fully remove the old, faulty element from the oven.

## Installing Your New Frigidaire Oven Heating Element

With the old element out, installing the new one is the reverse process. This is where your careful wire observation from earlier pays off. Ensure the new element is positioned correctly before securing it. This prevents any issues during operation.

### Connecting the Electrical Wires

Take your new Frigidaire oven heating element. Carefully connect the electrical wires to the new element's terminals. Match them exactly as they were on the old element. If you took a photo, refer to it now. Push the spade connectors firmly onto the terminals until they click into place. If your oven uses nuts, tighten them securely with your nut driver or pliers.

Make sure the connections are snug. Loose connections can cause arcing or poor performance. This step is critical for safe and effective operation. Double-check that no bare wire is exposed near the connection point.

### Securing the Element in Place

Once the wires are connected, gently push the new heating element into its mounting holes. Ensure the terminals are properly seated in the back wall. Align the screw holes on the element's mounting tabs with the holes in the oven wall. Insert the screws you removed earlier.

Tighten the screws firmly but do not overtighten. Overtightening can strip the screws or damage the element's mounting points. The element should feel secure and not wiggle. It should sit flush against the oven's back wall.

Your new element is now physically installed.

## Testing and Troubleshooting Your Repaired Frigidaire Oven

After replacing the heating element, you must test your oven. This confirms the repair was successful. It also allows you to catch any lingering issues. Do not skip this important final step. A quick test ensures your oven is ready for cooking.

### Initial Power-Up and Functionality Test

First, replace the oven racks. Slide the oven back into its position. Plug the oven back into the wall outlet or flip the circuit breaker back on. Now, set your oven to a baking temperature, such as 350Â°F (175Â°C).

Watch the new element. It should begin to glow red evenly within a few minutes. Listen for any unusual sounds or smells. A slight burning smell might occur initially due to dust or protective coatings burning off. This is normal. If the element glows and the oven heats up, your repair was successful. Let the oven run for about 15-20 minutes to ensure it reaches and maintains temperature.

### Common Issues and Simple Solutions

Sometimes, an issue might arise after replacement. If the element does not glow, first check the power connection. Ensure the oven is plugged in firmly. Also, verify the circuit breaker is on. Next, check the wire connections at the element terminals. Loose wires are a common cause of no heat. Ensure they are pushed on tightly.

If the new element is faulty out of the box, it is rare but possible. You might need to test the new element with a multimeter if it still does not work. If it shows "OL," you received a bad part. Contact the seller for a replacement. Remember, proper oven maintenance, including [how to clean an oven heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-oven-heating-element), can extend its life and prevent premature failures.

## Maintaining Your Oven's Heating Element for Longevity

Replacing an oven heating element can be a rare event. However, proper care can extend its lifespan. Simple habits keep your Frigidaire oven working well for many years. Regular maintenance prevents premature failures.

### Keeping the Element Clean

Avoid spills directly onto the heating elements. Food spills can burn onto the element's surface. This creates hotspots and uneven heating. These burnt residues can also cause unpleasant odors. If spills occur, clean them promptly after the oven cools down. Do not use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners directly on the element. A soft cloth and mild soap are usually enough for the surrounding areas. The elements themselves are self-cleaning to a degree, as high heat burns off most residues. However, large spills should be carefully wiped up.

### Avoiding Physical Damage

Heating elements are robust but can break from impact. Avoid placing heavy items directly on the element. Do not use metal spatulas or other tools to scrape food off the element. If you drop something heavy on it, the coil inside can break. Always be gentle when loading or unloading food from the oven. This small caution protects the delicate heating coil. Handle oven racks carefully. Dropping them onto the element can cause a crack or break.

### Understanding Normal Wear and Tear

Even with the best care, heating elements have a finite life. They undergo cycles of heating and cooling. This stress eventually leads to material fatigue. Most elements last several years. Factors like frequent high-temperature use can shorten this life. If your element fails after many years of service, it is likely due to normal wear and tear. This is not a sign of poor oven quality. Knowing this helps you manage expectations for your appliance's parts.
