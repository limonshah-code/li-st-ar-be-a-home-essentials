## Understanding Everchill RV Refrigerator Power Sources

Everchill RV refrigerators are popular for their efficiency and modern design. They differ from residential fridges because they operate on multiple power sources. Understanding these sources is key to properly turning off your Everchill RV refrigerator. These units typically run on 12-volt DC power and 120-volt AC power. Some older or specific models might also use propane. Knowing which power source your fridge is using helps you manage its shutdown effectively.

The primary power source for your Everchill RV refrigerator when parked at a campsite is often 120-volt AC power. This comes from your RV's shore power connection or a generator. When you are driving or boondocking, your Everchill unit relies on the RV's 12-volt DC battery system. This dual power capability offers flexibility but also requires careful attention when shutting down. You must ensure both AC and DC power are disconnected to completely power down the refrigerator. I always check both sources to be sure.

### AC Power: Shore Power and Generator

Your Everchill RV refrigerator uses 120-volt AC power when connected to shore power. This means plugging your RV into an electrical pedestal at a campground or your home. A generator also provides 120-volt AC power. When you want to turn off your Everchill RV refrigerator, start by disconnecting this primary power supply. Unplugging the shore power cord is the first physical step. If you are running a generator, turn it off.

This cuts the main AC power flow to your refrigerator. Always confirm the power is off at the source before doing any work inside the RV. Failing to cut AC power can leave your fridge partially energized. This could lead to continued operation or potential safety hazards. It is a simple but critical step in the shutdown process.

### DC Power: 12V Battery System

The 12-volt DC battery system powers your Everchill RV refrigerator when AC power is not available. This includes when you are driving or relying on your RV's internal batteries. Even if you unplug from shore power, your Everchill RV refrigerator might still draw power from the 12V system. This is often the case for residential-style RV refrigerators like many Everchill models. To fully turn off your Everchill RV refrigerator, you must disconnect the RV's 12V battery power.

Most RVs have a main battery disconnect switch. This switch usually sits near the RV's battery bank or inside the main control panel.
