### Takeaway

*   Select starchy potatoes like Russets for the best French fries.
*   Soak cut potatoes in cold water to remove excess starch, ensuring crispiness.
*   Pat potatoes completely dry before oiling and seasoning for superior results.
*   Cook fries in small batches for even browning and a crispy texture.
*   Shake the air fryer basket or rotate the rotisserie basket frequently.

### How do you make French fries in an Emeril Air Fryer 360?

To make French fries in an Emeril Air Fryer 360, cut potatoes into uniform sticks and soak them in cold water for 30 minutes. Pat them completely dry, then toss with a small amount of oil and seasonings. Air fry at 375°F (190°C) for 15-25 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through until golden and crispy.

## Why the Emeril Air Fryer 360 Excels for French Fries

The Emeril Air Fryer 360 is a versatile kitchen appliance. It uses rapid air circulation technology. This technology cooks food by surrounding it with hot air. This process creates a crispy exterior similar to deep-frying but with much less oil. I love how it achieves that perfect crunch without the greasy mess.

This air fryer model is perfect for making French fries. It often comes with a rotisserie basket. This basket continuously tumbles the fries. This ensures every side gets even exposure to the hot air. This even cooking promotes uniform crispness. Without a rotisserie, you must shake a standard basket often. The Emeril 360 also has precise temperature controls. You can set the exact heat needed for optimal fry cooking.

The Emeril Air Fryer 360 has a generous capacity. You can cook a good amount of fries at once. This is great for families or when entertaining guests. Its multi-functional design means it can do more than just air fry. This makes it a valuable tool in any kitchen. It is an investment in healthier, tastier meals. My experience shows it consistently delivers excellent results for French fries.

The air frying process minimizes fat intake. Deep-fried fries absorb a lot of oil. Air-fried fries use only a tablespoon or two. This makes air-fried fries a healthier option. You still get the satisfaction of crispy fries. The powerful fan ensures quick and even cooking. This saves time compared to conventional oven baking.

The Emeril Air Fryer 360 is simple to operate. Its digital display and preset functions simplify cooking. You just select the air fry setting. You set the temperature and time. Then you let the appliance do the work. This ease of use makes perfect French fries accessible to everyone. It really simplifies meal preparation.

## Essential Ingredients and Tools for Homemade Fries

Starting with the right ingredients is key to delicious French fries. The potato choice matters most. I always recommend using Russet potatoes. They have a high starch content and low moisture. This combination makes them ideal for frying. They get crispy on the outside and stay fluffy on the inside. Other options include Idaho or Maris Piper potatoes if Russets are not available.

You will need a good cooking oil. Avocado oil, grapeseed oil, or canola oil are excellent choices. They have high smoke points. This means they can withstand the high temperatures of air frying without burning. Just a small amount is needed to help with browning and crispness. I use about one to two tablespoons per batch of fries. Olive oil can be used, but be careful with its lower smoke point at very high temperatures.

Seasoning is also important. Basic salt is essential. I prefer fine sea salt because it sticks well. You can add black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, or paprika for extra flavor. Feel free to experiment with your favorite spices. Some people like a pinch of cayenne for a subtle kick.

Regarding tools, a sharp chef's knife or a mandoline slicer is crucial. You need to cut uniform potato sticks. Uniformity ensures even cooking. An apple slicer with a fry cutter attachment works too. A large bowl for soaking and mixing is necessary. Paper towels or a clean kitchen towel are vital for drying the potatoes. A pair of tongs helps with shaking the fries in the basket. These simple tools ensure your preparation is smooth and efficient.

Having all your ingredients and tools ready makes the process enjoyable. Good preparation always leads to better results. I find that when everything is organized, cooking becomes much less stressful. This setup helps you focus on the cooking process itself. It ensures consistency in your French fries.

## Preparing Your Potatoes for Perfect Crispiness

Proper potato preparation is the most critical step for crispy French fries. First, peel the potatoes. You can leave the skin on for a rustic look, but I find peeled potatoes cook more evenly. Next, cut the potatoes into uniform sticks. Aim for about ¼-inch to ½-inch thickness. Consistency is key here. If pieces are uneven, some will burn while others remain undercooked.

After cutting, soak the potato sticks in a large bowl of cold water. This step removes excess starch from the potatoes. Starch can make fries gummy or prevent them from getting truly crispy. Soak them for at least 30 minutes. For even crispier results, you can soak them for an hour or even overnight. If soaking overnight, cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator.

Once soaked, drain the potatoes thoroughly. This is where patience pays off. You must pat them completely dry. Use paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Any remaining moisture will turn into steam in the air fryer. Steam prevents the fries from crisping up properly. I usually lay them out in a single layer on towels and then pat them dry from the top. Do not rush this drying process.

A truly dry potato stick will crisp up beautifully. A damp one will steam. This step is non-negotiable for achieving that coveted golden crunch. Take your time to ensure all surface moisture is gone. This careful preparation sets the stage for success. It ensures your Emeril Air Fryer 360 can do its best work.

## Seasoning and Coating Your French Fries

Once your potato sticks are perfectly dry, it is time to season and coat them. This step adds flavor and promotes browning. Place the dried potato sticks in a large bowl. Drizzle them with a small amount of oil. I typically use one to two tablespoons of a high smoke point oil like avocado or grapeseed oil for a medium batch. The oil helps the seasonings stick and encourages crisping.

Toss the potatoes gently to coat them evenly with the oil. You want just a light film of oil on each piece. Too much oil can make the fries soggy. Too little might result in dry, unappealing fries. The goal is a thin, uniform coating. Use your hands or tongs to mix thoroughly.

Now, add your seasonings. A simple sprinkle of fine sea salt is essential. I always start with salt. You can then add other flavors. Garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or even a dash of chili powder work well. Mix again to ensure the seasonings distribute evenly over all the fries. This guarantees flavor in every bite.

For extra crispiness, some people like to add a tiny pinch of cornstarch or baking powder with the seasonings. This is optional but can boost crunch. If using the rotisserie basket in your Emeril Air Fryer 360, ensure the fries are not clumped together. This ensures maximum air circulation. Proper coating ensures delicious, golden-brown results.

## Air Frying French Fries in the Emeril Air Fryer 360

Now for the main event: air frying your prepared French fries. Preheat your Emeril Air Fryer 360 to 375°F (190°C). Preheating is important. It ensures the air fryer is at the correct temperature from the start. This promotes immediate crisping when the fries enter. It prevents them from slowly heating up and steaming.

If using the standard basket, arrange the fries in a single layer. Do not overcrowd the basket. Overcrowding reduces air circulation. This results in steamed, soggy fries instead of crispy ones. Cook in batches if necessary. I usually find that a single layer allows the air to circulate best.

If your Emeril Air Fryer 360 has a rotisserie basket, you can fill it without worrying about a single layer. The continuous rotation does the work of shaking. This means you can cook a larger batch. Secure the rotisserie basket properly inside the air fryer.

Cook the fries for 15-25 minutes. The exact time varies based on fry thickness and batch size. For standard basket cooking, shake the basket vigorously every 5-7 minutes. This ensures all sides of the fries cook evenly. If using the rotisserie basket, you just need to let it spin. Check the fries at the 15-minute mark. Continue cooking until they are golden brown and crispy.

Different air fryers vary slightly in their heating elements and fans. You might need to adjust the cooking time by a few minutes. I always recommend checking them frequently towards the end of the cooking cycle. This prevents burning. You want a deep golden color and a firm, crispy texture.

## Achieving Crispy Perfection and Serving

Once your French fries are golden brown and sound crispy when you tap them, they are ready. Carefully remove them from the Emeril Air Fryer 360. If using the rotisserie basket, use oven mitts to unhook and remove it. Be careful, as the basket will be hot. If using the regular basket, simply slide it out.

Immediately transfer the hot fries to a large bowl. Sprinkle them with a little more salt if desired. I often add a second pinch of fine sea salt right after cooking. This ensures the salt sticks to the freshly cooked fries. Toss them gently to distribute the salt. The residual heat helps the salt adhere.

Serve your homemade air-fried French fries immediately. French fries are best consumed hot and fresh. They will lose their crispness as they cool. Pair them with your favorite dipping sauces. Ketchup, mayonnaise, a spicy aioli, or even a simple malt vinegar are great choices.

If you have multiple batches to cook, keep the first batch warm in a low oven (around 200°F/93°C) while the others finish. This helps maintain some crispness. However, air-fried fries are always at their peak right out of the fryer. Enjoy the healthier, perfectly crispy results.

## Troubleshooting and Emeril Air Fryer Care

Even with careful preparation, sometimes things go wrong. If your French fries are soggy, it is usually due to too much moisture. Ensure you dry the potatoes completely after soaking. Overcrowding the air fryer basket can also lead to sogginess. Cook in smaller batches to allow proper air circulation. Not shaking the fries enough in a standard basket can also cause uneven cooking and less crispness.

If your fries are too pale, they might need more time. Increase the cooking time by a few minutes. Make sure your air fryer is preheated. Sometimes, a slightly higher temperature (like 400°F/200°C for the last 5 minutes) can help achieve extra crispness. If they are burning, reduce the cooking time or temperature slightly. Check them more often.

After enjoying your delicious French fries, proper air fryer care is essential. Regular cleaning extends the life of your appliance. It also ensures consistent cooking performance. Food residue and grease can build up over time. This affects heating efficiency and can cause odors. I always make sure to clean my air fryer after each use.

To clean the Emeril Air Fryer 360, unplug it and let it cool completely. The basket and racks are usually non-stick. They can often be washed with warm, soapy water.
