Cochrane was a wealthy socialite living in Shelbyville, Illinois. She frequently hosted dinner parties. Her servants often broke her expensive china while washing dishes by hand. Frustrated by the damage, she decided to invent a machine that could wash dishes more safely. She wanted a machine that would clean them faster and better.

She did not find any existing machine that met her needs. Therefore, she set out to build her own. Cochrane designed wire compartments to hold plates, cups, and saucers. These compartments fit into a wheel that lay flat inside a copper boiler. A motor turned the wheel, and hot soapy water sprayed up from the bottom. Her machine used water pressure to clean the dishes. This was a new and effective approach.

Cochrane's invention was revolutionary because it worked well. It cleaned dishes without breaking them. She patented her design in 1886. She then displayed it at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Her machine won the highest award for mechanical construction, durability, and adaptation. This public recognition helped her gain commercial attention. Her invention was initially popular in hotels and restaurants. Eventually, it made its way into homes.
