## Troubleshooting Your LG Dryer Start Button

A dryer that does not start creates a big problem. You load your laundry, press the start button, and nothing happens. This can be frustrating, especially with a busy schedule. You expect your LG dryer to work, but it sometimes surprises you.

Many LG dryer owners experience issues with the start button. It might seem like a small part, but a non-functional start button stops your entire laundry cycle. I understand this inconvenience. This article gives you clear steps to diagnose and fix your LG dryer start button. We cover simple checks, common parts that fail, and more advanced solutions. You will learn to identify the problem and solve it.

### Takeaway

*   Always disconnect power before any repairs. Safety is first.
*   Check simple issues like power supply and door closure first.
*   The door switch, thermal fuse, and start button itself are common failure points.
*   Use a multimeter for testing electrical components.
*   Consider professional help for complex control board issues.

### Clear, Concise Answer

To fix an LG dryer start button that is not working, first check the power supply and ensure the door is fully closed. Then, inspect the door switch, thermal fuse, and the start button assembly for damage or lack of continuity using a multimeter. Replace any faulty parts to restore functionality.

### Initial Checks and Power Supply Issues

Your LG dryer start button will not work if the unit does not receive power. This is the first thing to check. Power problems are common and easy to fix. Do not overlook these simple steps.

First, check your home's circuit breaker. A tripped breaker cuts power to the dryer. Go to your electrical panel and look for a breaker in the "off" or middle position. Flip it firmly to the "off" position, then back to "on." This restores power.

Next, examine the power cord itself. Make sure it is fully plugged into the wall outlet. A loose plug prevents electricity flow. Also, check the outlet itself. You can test it by plugging in another appliance, like a lamp. If the lamp works, the outlet is fine. If not, the outlet might need repair. For more help with no power issues, you can review how to fix an [LG dryer no power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-dryer-no-power) problem.

Sometimes, the power cord itself can be damaged. Look for frayed wires or scorch marks. If you see damage, replace the cord. Do not use a damaged cord. It is a safety hazard. Ensure your power source meets the dryer's requirements. LG dryers typically need a 240-volt outlet.

*   **Verify Circuit Breaker:**
    *   Locate your home's main electrical panel.
    *   Find the breaker labeled for your laundry room or dryer.
    *   If it is tripped, reset it by turning it completely off, then on again.
*   **Check Power Cord Connection:**
    *   Confirm the cord is fully inserted into the wall outlet.
    *   Wiggle the plug gently to ensure a secure connection.
*   **Test the Wall Outlet:**
    *   Plug a small appliance, like a hairdryer, into the same outlet.
    *   If the appliance does not turn on, the outlet may be faulty.
*   **Inspect Power Cord for Damage:**
    *   Look closely at the cord for any cuts, frays, or burn marks.
    *   Replace a damaged cord immediately.

Solving power issues is a critical first step. Many "LG dryer start button not working" problems stem from simple power interruptions. Always ensure power before checking other components. This approach saves time and keeps you safe.

### The Door Switch - A Common Culprit

The door switch is a vital safety feature in your LG dryer. It prevents the dryer from running when the door is open. If this switch malfunctions, your LG dryer start button will not work. The dryer thinks the door is open, even when it is closed.

You can often hear a click when you close the dryer door. This click means the door switch activates. If you do not hear it, the switch might be stuck or broken. The switch is usually located inside the door frame. It aligns with a plastic or metal strike on the door itself.

To inspect the door switch, first unplug your dryer from the wall. Safety is important before touching any internal parts. Open the dryer door. You will see the switch near the top or side of the door opening. Push the plunger on the switch by hand. It should move freely and spring back.

If the plunger is sticky or broken, the switch needs replacement. You can also test the switch for electrical continuity using a multimeter. Set the multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. Disconnect the wires from the switch. Place the multimeter probes on the switch terminals. With the plunger extended (door open), there should be no continuity (open circuit). With the plunger depressed (door closed), there should be continuity (closed circuit, usually a reading near zero ohms).

*   **Locate the Door Switch:**
    *   The switch is typically on the dryer frame, near the door opening.
    *   It has a small plunger that the door presses.
*   **Check for Physical Damage:**
    *   Examine the plunger for cracks or bending.
    *   Ensure it moves freely when pressed.
*   **Test Continuity with Multimeter:**
    *   Disconnect power to the dryer.
    *   Remove the wires from the door switch terminals.
    *   Set your multimeter to the continuity or ohms setting.
    *   Press the plunger. The multimeter should show continuity (a beep or a low ohm reading).
    *   Release the plunger. The multimeter should show no continuity (open circuit).
*   **Replace if Faulty:**
    *   If the switch does not show correct continuity, replace it.
    *   Order the correct part number for your LG dryer model.

A faulty door switch is a very common reason for an LG dryer not starting. Replacing it is a straightforward fix for most people.

### Thermal Fuse and High-Limit Thermostat Problems

Your LG dryer uses a thermal fuse and high-limit thermostat for safety. These components protect your dryer from overheating. If the dryer gets too hot, they trip or blow, cutting power to prevent damage or fire. When either of these parts fails, your LG dryer start button will become unresponsive. The dryer acts as if it has no power at all.

The thermal fuse is a one-time safety device. If it blows, you must replace it. It indicates an underlying airflow problem or other issue causing overheating. The high-limit thermostat is resettable, but a tripped thermostat also points to an overheating problem. You need to fix the cause of the overheating.

To check these components, first unplug your dryer. Accessing them usually involves removing the dryer's back panel or top panel. The thermal fuse is often located on the blower housing. The high-limit thermostat is typically on the heating element housing. They look like small disc-shaped components with two wires connected.

Use a multimeter to test for continuity. Set the multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. Disconnect the wires from the thermal fuse. Place the probes on the fuse terminals. A good thermal fuse will show continuity (a very low ohm reading, near zero). If it shows no continuity (open circuit), it is blown and needs replacement. Do the same for the high-limit thermostat. It should also show continuity. If it does not, it is faulty or tripped. For deeper cleaning that can prevent overheating issues, you might want to learn [how to clean an LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer).

*   **Safety First:** Disconnect your dryer from power.
*   **Locate Components:**
    *   Remove the dryer's back or top panel.
    *   Find the thermal fuse on the blower housing.
    *   Find the high-limit thermostat near the heating element.
*   **Test with Multimeter:**
    *   Remove wires from each component.
    *   Touch multimeter probes to terminals.
    *   A good component shows continuity (low ohms). No continuity means it is bad.
*   **Replace as Needed:**
    *   If the thermal fuse has no continuity, replace it.
    *   If the high-limit thermostat has no continuity, replace it.
*   **Address Overheating Cause:**
    *   Check for clogged lint screens or vent ducts. This is the most common cause of overheating.
    *   Ensure proper ventilation in your laundry area.

Replacing these parts without addressing the cause of overheating will lead to repeated failures. Always clear your dryer vents regularly.

### Examining the Start Button and Control Panel

If the external checks and safety devices are fine, the problem might be with the LG dryer start button itself or the control panel it connects to. Buttons can wear out from repeated use. Contacts inside the button can become dirty or corroded. This stops the electrical signal from reaching the dryer's main control board.

First, visually inspect the start button. Is it stuck in the pressed position? Does it feel loose or broken when you push it? Sometimes, debris gets lodged around the button, preventing it from moving freely. Clean around the button with a small brush or cotton swab.

To test the start button electrically, you need to access the control panel. This usually means removing the top panel of your dryer and then unscrewing the control panel assembly. Be gentle; there are many wires. Disconnect the dryer from power before you start. Locate the two wires connected to the start button.

Use a multimeter set to continuity mode. Disconnect the wires from the button. Place one probe on each terminal of the start button. When you do not press the button, there should be no continuity (open circuit). When you press and hold the button, the multimeter should show continuity (a beep or low ohm reading). If the button does not show continuity when pressed, it is faulty and needs replacement.

*   **Visual Inspection:**
    *   Check if the button is physically stuck or damaged.
    *   Clean any visible debris around the button.
*   **Access the Control Panel:**
    *   Unplug the dryer.
    *   Carefully remove the dryer's top panel.
    *   Unscrew and gently pull the control panel forward.
*   **Locate and Test the Start Button:**
    *   Identify the two wires connected to the actual start button.
    *   Disconnect these wires.
    *   Place multimeter probes on the button terminals.
    *   Press the button: Multimeter should show continuity.
    *   Release the button: Multimeter should show no continuity.
*   **Consider Control Board:**
    *   If the button tests good, the issue might be the control board.
    *   The control board interprets the button's signal.
    *   A faulty control board needs professional diagnosis or replacement. This is a more complex repair.

Replacing the start button is usually simpler than replacing the control board. If your LG dryer start button is visibly damaged or fails the continuity test, replace it first.

### Motor and Belt System Diagnostics

Even if your LG dryer start button works, the dryer still might not start spinning. This often points to issues with the motor or the drive belt. The start button sends a signal to the motor. If the motor or belt is bad, the dryer won't begin its cycle. The motor is the heart of your dryer, turning the drum. The drive belt connects the motor to the drum.

First, check the drive belt. Unplug the dryer. Open the dryer door and try to spin the drum by hand. If it spins very easily, or if you feel no resistance, the drive belt might be broken. A broken belt means the motor spins, but the drum does not. You will need to remove the dryer's top and front panels to visually inspect the belt. It wraps around the drum and a motor pulley. If it is snapped or frayed, replace it.

Next, consider the motor. The motor can fail in a few ways. It might hum but not spin. This often indicates a bad motor start winding or capacitor. Sometimes, the motor simply does not receive power or has seized. You can often hear a distinct humming sound if the motor tries to start but fails. If you hear nothing, it could be the motor or something preventing power from reaching it. While a Whirlpool dryer might have different components, general troubleshooting for a dryer that turns on but does not start, similar to "[why does my whirlpool dryer turn on but not start](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dryer-turn-on-but-not-start)", can offer some conceptual guidance.

Testing the motor directly is more complex. It involves checking voltages and resistance, which is best left to a professional. However, ruling out the belt is a good first step. If the belt is intact and the motor hums but does not turn the drum, the motor capacitor or the motor itself is likely faulty.

*   **Check the Drive Belt:**
    *   Unplug the dryer.
    *   Open the dryer door.
    *   Try to spin the drum manually.
    *   If it spins too freely, the belt is likely broken.
    *   Remove panels to visually inspect the belt for breakage or slippage.
*   **Listen for Motor Sounds:**
    *   Plug in the dryer and briefly press the start button.
    *   Listen for a humming sound without drum movement. This suggests a motor issue.
    *   No sound at all could mean no power to the motor or a seized motor.
*   **Motor Inspection (Advanced):**
    *   Access the motor. This requires significant disassembly.
    *   Look for any signs of burning or physical damage.
    *   Consider a motor capacitor test if you have the tools and knowledge.
*   **Replace if Necessary:**
    *   A broken belt is a DIY fix.
    *   A faulty motor often requires professional repair or replacement.

Ensuring the motor and belt system work correctly is crucial for your LG dryer's operation. A working LG dryer start button means nothing if the motor cannot turn the drum.

### Advanced Electronic Control Board Issues

The electronic control board is the "brain" of your LG dryer. It receives signals from the start button, door switch, and other sensors. Then it sends commands to the motor, heating element, and other components. If the LG dryer start button works but the dryer does nothing, a faulty control board is a possible cause.

Control board failures can manifest in different ways. Sometimes, the dryer does not respond to any button presses. Other times, specific functions fail, or error codes appear on the display. A power surge or component failure on the board itself can damage it.

Diagnosing a control board issue is difficult without specialized tools. You cannot easily test individual components on the board. A visual inspection might reveal burnt components or damaged traces. However, many failures are internal and not visible.

Before assuming the control board is bad, ensure all other components are working. Check the power, door switch, thermal fuse, and motor as discussed. If all these parts test good, the control board is the prime suspect. LG dryers often have diagnostic modes. Refer to your dryer's service manual for steps to enter diagnostic mode. This mode can help identify which components the board sees as faulty.

*   **Symptoms of a Bad Control Board:**
    *   No response from any buttons, including the start button.
    *   Display lights are off or show gibberish.
    *   Random error codes appear.
    *   Specific dryer functions do not work.
*   **Visual Inspection:**
    *   Disconnect power to the dryer.
    *   Access the control board, usually behind the control panel.
    *   Look for burnt spots, swollen capacitors, or loose connections.
*   **Confirm Other Components are Good:**
    *   Ensure the power supply, door switch, thermal fuse, and motor are all working correctly.
    *   The control board is often the last component to suspect after checking everything else.
*   **Diagnostic Mode (Refer to Manual):**
    *   Some LG models have built-in diagnostic modes.
    *   Consult your specific model's service manual for instructions on how to access and interpret these modes.
*   **Replacement:**
    *   Replacing a control board is expensive.
    *   It involves disconnecting many wires and connectors.
    *   Ensure you get the exact part number for your LG dryer model.
    *   Consider professional help for control board replacement if you are not comfortable.

A faulty control board is a serious issue. While a DIY fix is possible, it demands precision. For optimal functionality of your LG dryer, proper control board operation is key.

### Smart Features and App-Related Starts

Modern LG dryers often include smart features. These allow you to control your dryer using the LG ThinQ app on your smartphone. This can sometimes affect how your LG dryer start button works or appears to work. If you typically start your dryer via the app, you might not notice a physical button issue right away.

First, check if your dryer has been set to a "remote start" or "Smart Grid" mode. Many LG smart appliances require you to activate a remote start function on the appliance itself before you can control it via the app. If this mode is active, the physical start button might be disabled until the remote start option is turned off. You might press the button, but nothing happens. For specific steps, you can learn [how to start an LG dryer from the app](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-start-lg-dryer-from-app).

Ensure your dryer is connected to your home Wi-Fi network and the ThinQ app is functioning correctly. A poor Wi-Fi connection or an app glitch could prevent remote commands from reaching the dryer. Try restarting your router or reconnecting the dryer to the app.

If your physical LG dryer start button is not responding and you rely on smart features, try disabling the remote start function on the dryer's control panel. Then, attempt to start it using the physical button. If it works, the issue was with the smart feature's settings, not a broken button. If it still does not work, the problem is likely mechanical or electrical with the button itself. Many users find it convenient to start their LG dryer from the app, and there are specific steps on [how to start an LG dryer from the app](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-start-lg-dryer-from-app).

### Preventative Maintenance Tips for Your LG Dryer

Keeping your LG dryer in good shape helps prevent future start button issues. Regular maintenance extends the life of your appliance. It also keeps it running efficiently. I always recommend these simple steps.

First, clean the lint filter after every single load. This is vital. A clogged lint filter restricts airflow. This causes the dryer to overheat. Overheating can damage components like the thermal fuse, which stops the dryer from starting. A clean filter helps your dryer run cooler.

Next, clean the dryer vent system at least once a year. Lint builds up in the vent duct over time. This also restricts airflow and causes overheating. You can use a dryer vent cleaning kit. This connects to your vacuum cleaner. Make sure to clean the entire length of the vent. This includes the part going outside your house. Good airflow is essential.

Check the dryer's power cord and outlet periodically. Look for signs of wear, fraying, or loose connections. A stable power supply prevents stress on the dryer's electrical components. Ensure the dryer is plugged directly into a wall outlet. Do not use extension cords. Extension cords can overheat and are a fire hazard.

*   **Clean Lint Filter Regularly:**
    *   Remove and clean the lint filter after every load.
    *   Wash the filter with soap and water occasionally to remove fabric softener residue.
*   **Clean Dryer Vent System Annually:**
    *   Disconnect the dryer.
    *   Use a dryer vent cleaning brush kit to clear lint from the ductwork.
    *   Clean the exterior vent hood too.
*   **Inspect Power Connection:**
    *   Periodically check the power cord for damage.
    *   Ensure the plug is secure in the wall outlet.
    *   Avoid using extension cords.
*   **Check for Unusual Noises:**
    *   Listen for squealing or grinding sounds during operation.
    *   These can indicate a worn belt or motor bearing issue. Addressing them early prevents bigger problems.
*   **Keep Area Clear:**
    *   Ensure the area around the dryer is clear of obstructions.
    *   This provides good airflow and prevents overheating.

Following these preventative maintenance tips helps ensure your LG dryer runs smoothly. It reduces the chance of issues with your LG dryer start button. It also keeps your appliance safe and reliable.
