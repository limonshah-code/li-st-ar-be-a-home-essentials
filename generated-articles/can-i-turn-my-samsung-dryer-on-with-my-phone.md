### Clear Answer to the Main Query

Yes, you can turn your Samsung dryer on with your phone. This capability requires a compatible Samsung smart dryer model and the Samsung SmartThings app. You must first connect the dryer to your home's Wi-Fi network. Then, you enable the remote control feature on the dryer itself.

## Understanding Samsung SmartThings and Your Smart Dryer

Samsung has integrated smart technology into many home appliances. The SmartThings ecosystem is the core of this integration. It allows devices to communicate and be controlled from one central app. Your Samsung dryer becomes part of this smart network.

Not all Samsung dryers offer smart capabilities. You need a model designed with Wi-Fi connectivity. These models usually have a Smart Control button or a Wi-Fi indicator on the control panel. Check your dryer's specifications or its user manual to confirm compatibility. You can also look for the SmartThings logo on the appliance itself. SmartThings brings your home appliances together. It makes daily tasks simpler and more efficient.

The SmartThings app is available on both Android and iOS devices. You download it from your device's app store. This app acts as your command center. It lets you monitor and control various smart devices. This includes your dryer, washing machine, refrigerator, and more. With the right dryer model, you can gain a new level of control. This changes how you manage your laundry routine.

## Setting Up Your Samsung Dryer for Phone Control

Connecting your Samsung dryer to your phone involves a few straightforward steps. First, ensure your dryer is plugged in and has power. You will need a strong Wi-Fi signal where your dryer is located. A weak signal can cause connection problems. Make sure your phone is also connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

Begin by downloading the SmartThings app to your smartphone. Open the app and create a Samsung account if you do not have one already. Once logged in, tap the "Add device" or "+" icon. The app will guide you through adding a new appliance. Select "Dryer" from the list of appliance types.

The app will prompt you to put your dryer into "AP (Access Point) mode" or "Connect mode." This usually involves pressing and holding a combination of buttons on your dryer's control panel. Refer to your dryer's manual for the exact button sequence. Once the dryer is in connection mode, the app will scan for it. It will then connect your dryer to your home Wi-Fi network. This process links your dryer to your SmartThings account. You are now ready for the next steps.

## Activating Remote Control Features on Your Samsung Dryer

Connecting your dryer to the SmartThings app is only the first part. You must activate the remote control function on the dryer itself. This is a safety measure. It prevents accidental starts when you are not home. Most Samsung smart dryers have a "Smart Control" or "Remote Enable" button. This button typically needs to be pressed before each remote start.

To activate remote control, make sure your dryer is on. Press the "Smart Control" button on the dryer's panel. A light or an icon will illuminate, indicating that remote control is active. This light means the dryer is now ready to receive commands from your phone. You will need to press this button every time you want to use the remote start feature. This ensures that the dryer is not accidentally started without a manual check.

This safety feature is important. It prevents clothes from sitting in the dryer too long if you forget them. It also prevents the dryer from running empty. Ensure the dryer door is closed firmly and the drum is loaded. Only then should you activate the remote control function. This simple step makes sure your smart features work safely and effectively.

## Key SmartThings Features for Your Samsung Dryer

The SmartThings app offers more than just remote starting. It provides a suite of features that enhance your laundry experience. Knowing these can help you use your smart dryer to its full potential.

One primary feature is remote start. You can load your dryer, activate the remote control on the machine, then leave. Start the cycle from your phone when you are ready. This is helpful if you are delayed or want to ensure clothes are dry when you arrive home. Another valuable feature is cycle monitoring. The app shows you the current cycle status, time remaining, and even alerts you when the cycle finishes. This means no more trips to the laundry room to check if clothes are done. This can be especially useful if your Samsung dryer takes a long time to dry. You can check its progress right from your device.

The app also sends notifications. You will receive alerts when a cycle ends. It can also notify you about filter cleaning reminders. Some models even offer intelligent recommendations. They might suggest the best drying cycle based on the wash cycle used. This is called "Auto Cycle Link" and links your smart washer and dryer. The app can also provide basic troubleshooting tips. If your dryer experiences issues, the app might offer initial guidance. For instance, if you are wondering [why your Samsung dryer is turning off before clothes are dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dryer-turning-off-before-clothes-are-dry), the app might provide a suggestion or error code. These features add convenience and efficiency to your laundry routine.

## Troubleshooting Common Connectivity Issues

Sometimes, smart appliances do not connect as easily as we hope. If you are having trouble getting your Samsung dryer to respond to your phone, do not worry. Many common issues have simple solutions.

First, check your Wi-Fi connection. Ensure your router is working and your internet is active. Both your phone and your dryer need a strong, stable connection to the same Wi-Fi network. If the Wi-Fi signal is weak, try moving your router closer. Alternatively, consider a Wi-Fi extender. Sometimes, simply restarting your router can resolve connectivity issues.

Next, verify the SmartThings app is updated to its latest version. Outdated apps can cause compatibility problems. Also, ensure your dryer's firmware is current. You can often check for and install dryer updates through the SmartThings app. If your dryer is showing signs of trouble, like [turning on but not starting](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dryer-turning-on-but-not-starting), connectivity might not be the only problem. Sometimes, a full power cycle of your dryer helps. Unplug it for a few minutes, then plug it back in. This can reset the internal components and re-establish a connection.

If you have tried these steps and still have issues, try re-adding the dryer to the SmartThings app. Remove the device from your app first. Then, go through the setup process again from the beginning. Ensure the remote control button on the dryer is pressed before attempting to start a cycle via the app. Lastly, ensure your dryer is clean and well-maintained. A dirty lint filter or moisture sensor can affect performance, which might indirectly impact smart features.

## Benefits of Remote Dryer Operation

Using your phone to control your Samsung dryer offers several advantages. These benefits go beyond simple convenience. They can make your daily life more efficient and less stressful.

One major benefit is flexibility. You can start a dry cycle even when you are not at home. This means you can keep your laundry moving throughout the day. Imagine putting clothes in the dryer before leaving for work. You can start the dryer during your lunch break. The clothes are then ready to fold when you arrive home. This helps prevent wrinkles from clothes sitting too long. It also saves you time once you are back home.

Remote operation also helps with energy efficiency. Some smart dryers can integrate with energy monitoring features in SmartThings. You might be able to schedule cycles during off-peak electricity hours. This could lead to savings on your utility bill. Receiving notifications when a cycle finishes prevents clothes from over-drying. Over-drying can damage fabrics and waste energy. This feature helps your clothes last longer.

Another benefit is peace of mind. You can check the dryer's status from anywhere. This eliminates the worry of forgetting to start a load. It also confirms that a cycle is running as expected. For instance, if you are concerned [why your Samsung dryer takes so long to dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-samsung-dryer-take-so-long-to-dry), checking the status on your phone can provide immediate insight without needing to be physically present. The ability to monitor your appliance remotely adds a layer of control and reassurance.

## Safety Considerations for Smart Appliance Use

While smart features offer great convenience, safety should always be a priority. When using your phone to control your Samsung dryer, remember a few key safety practices. These ensure safe operation and prevent potential hazards.

Always load your dryer completely before enabling remote control. Make sure the dryer door is securely closed. An open door will prevent the dryer from starting, even with the remote command. It is also important to ensure the lint filter is clean before each use. A clogged lint filter is a common cause of dryer fires. Regularly cleaning your lint filter is essential for fire safety. This is critical whether you are starting the dryer manually or remotely.

Never leave flammable materials in or on top of your dryer. This includes cleaning chemicals or aerosols. These items can pose a serious fire risk when exposed to heat. Ensure the area around your dryer is clear of obstructions. Good airflow around the appliance helps prevent overheating.

Remember, the remote start feature on most Samsung dryers requires a physical button press on the dryer itself before it can receive a remote command. This is a deliberate safety design. It ensures someone has checked the dryer and its contents before it can be started remotely. This prevents unintended operation when, for example, a child might be playing near the dryer. Always check your dryer's manual for specific safety instructions related to remote use. Following these guidelines helps you enjoy your smart dryer features without compromising safety.
