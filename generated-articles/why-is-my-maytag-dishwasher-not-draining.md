## Troubleshooting Your Maytag Dishwasher: Why It's Not Draining

Washing dishes by hand is never anyone's favorite chore. That's why a working dishwasher is essential for many households. When you find your Maytag dishwasher not draining, it can disrupt your kitchen routine and cause significant frustration. I know the feeling of opening the dishwasher door after a cycle, only to see murky water sitting at the bottom.

This common problem often signals an issue within the appliance's drainage system. We will explore the common reasons why your Maytag dishwasher is not draining. We will also provide clear, actionable steps you can take to diagnose and resolve these issues. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to get your Maytag dishwasher back to properly cleaning and draining.

### Takeaway

If your Maytag dishwasher is not draining, follow these steps to find and fix the problem:
*   Inspect and clean the drain filter and sump area.
*   Check the drain hose for kinks or clogs.
*   Ensure your garbage disposal, if connected, is clear.
*   Test the drain pump for proper function.
*   Verify the float switch operates correctly.

### Clear Answer to Your Main Query

Your Maytag dishwasher is likely not draining due to a clog in the filter, sump, or drain hose, a malfunctioning drain pump, or issues with the garbage disposal connection. Addressing these specific areas will typically resolve the problem.

## Understanding Your Maytag Dishwasher's Drain System

Your Maytag dishwasher relies on a specific sequence to drain water. First, the wash cycle finishes. Then, the drain pump activates, pushing water out of the tub. This water travels through a drain hose, often connected to a garbage disposal or a dedicated sink drain.

Understanding each component is key to diagnosing a "Maytag dishwasher not draining" issue. The system includes filters, a sump, a drain hose, a drain pump, and sometimes an air gap or garbage disposal connection. Each part must work correctly for proper drainage. A problem in any part can stop the water from leaving the dishwasher.

When water remains in the tub, it indicates a blockage or a mechanical failure. Proper maintenance, like regularly cleaning filters, helps prevent many draining problems. Knowing how these parts interact makes troubleshooting much simpler. We will look at each component in detail next.

## Common Culprits: Clogged Drain Filter and Sump

A common reason your Maytag dishwasher is not draining is a clogged drain filter or sump area. Food particles and debris accumulate in these areas over time. This buildup blocks water from reaching the drain pump. I always recommend checking here first when facing drainage issues.

You can usually find the filter assembly at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It often consists of a cylindrical filter and a flat filter screen. Removing and cleaning these components is a straightforward process. Make sure to consult your Maytag owner's manual for specific instructions on how to access and clean your model's filters.

To clean the filter:
*   Remove the bottom dish rack to gain access.
*   Twist or lift out the filter assembly.
*   Rinse the filter under running water to remove food particles. Use a soft brush if needed.
*   Clean the sump area, which is the basin below the filter, removing any visible debris.
*   Reinstall the filter assembly securely.

Neglecting regular filter cleaning can lead to poor wash performance and, eventually, drainage problems. A clean filter ensures water flows freely into the drain pump. If your dishwasher is also [Why Is My Maytag Dishwasher Not Cleaning](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-maytag-dishwasher-not-cleaning) well, a clogged filter is a prime suspect for that issue too.

## Examining the Dishwasher's Drain Hose

Another frequent cause for a Maytag dishwasher not draining is an issue with the drain hose. This hose carries the wastewater from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. Problems with the hose can prevent proper drainage. A kink or a clog within the hose will stop water flow.

First, visually inspect the drain hose for any obvious kinks or bends. These often occur if the dishwasher has been moved or pushed too far against a wall. Straighten any kinks you find. This simple step can sometimes immediately resolve the draining problem.

Next, check for internal clogs. Food particles, grease, or even small foreign objects can get stuck inside the hose. Disconnecting the hose from both the dishwasher and the sink drain/disposal can help you clear it. Place a bucket underneath to catch any residual water.

You can use a long brush or even a straightened coat hanger to gently push through the hose and dislodge any blockages. Be careful not to puncture the hose. Once cleared, reattach the hose securely, ensuring there are no new kinks. A clear drain hose is essential for proper water evacuation.

## Garbage Disposal and Air Gap Issues

If your Maytag dishwasher's drain hose connects to a garbage disposal, the disposal itself can be the source of your draining problem. A common oversight is not removing the knockout plug when a new garbage disposal is installed. This small plug must be removed to allow the dishwasher to drain into the disposal. If you recently installed a new disposal and your Maytag dishwasher isn't draining, check for this plug first.

Even if the knockout plug is removed, a clogged garbage disposal can prevent proper drainage. Food waste can back up into the dishwasher's drain line. Try running the garbage disposal with plenty of cold water to clear any obstructions. Make sure the disposal is completely empty before running the dishwasher.

Some dishwashers also use an air gap, a small cylindrical device on top of your sink. The air gap prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If the air gap itself becomes clogged, it can restrict drainage from the dishwasher. You can typically unscrew the cap and clean any debris that has accumulated inside. Ensuring both your garbage disposal and air gap are clear is crucial for your Maytag dishwasher to drain effectively. Issues like these are common across various brands, including when an [Asko dishwasher not draining all the water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-asko-dishwasher-not-draining-all-the-water).

## The Role of the Drain Pump and Motor

When your Maytag dishwasher is not draining, and you've ruled out clogs in the filter, sump, and hose, the drain pump is the next component to examine. The drain pump is responsible for forcibly expelling water from the dishwasher tub. If the pump is faulty or obstructed, water will simply sit at the bottom. I've often seen this as the core issue for a complete drainage failure.

A drain pump can fail due to several reasons. Sometimes, a small piece of glass, a broken dish fragment, or other debris can get past the filter and jam the impeller inside the pump. You might hear a humming noise but no draining, which suggests the motor is trying to run but something is blocking the pump. In other cases, the pump's motor itself might burn out or wear down.

To check the drain pump, you usually need to access it from beneath the dishwasher. This often involves pulling the appliance out and carefully tilting it back. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before attempting this. Remove the pump housing and inspect the impeller for any foreign objects. If no obstruction is found, but the pump still doesn't operate, it likely needs replacement. Testing with a multimeter can confirm if the motor is receiving power but not functioning.

## Float Switch Malfunctions and Door Latch Problems

The float switch is a safety device inside your Maytag dishwasher. It detects the water level in the tub. If the float switch gets stuck in the "full" position, it signals the control board that the dishwasher is already full. This prevents the dishwasher from starting a new cycle or even draining the existing water, as it "thinks" there's too much water. I've seen situations where the float switch is just sticky, preventing it from dropping down after a cycle.

You can usually find the float switch at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, often near the front. It typically consists of a small plastic cup or disc that floats up with rising water. Manually press it down and release it to ensure it moves freely. Clean any debris around its base that might be preventing its free movement. If it remains stuck, the switch might be faulty and need replacement.

Another less common but possible issue is with the door latch. The dishwasher's control board needs to register that the door is securely closed for any cycle to begin, including the drain cycle. If the latch is faulty or the door is not closing properly, the dishwasher may not initiate draining. Ensure the door latches firmly. Sometimes, simply closing the door with a bit more force or adjusting the latch can solve the problem. If your Maytag dishwasher doesn't even start filling with water, it could also be a door latch issue, similar to problems where a [Maytag dishwasher won't fill with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-maytag-dishwasher-fill-with-water).

## Control Board and Electrical Considerations

When all mechanical components like the filter, hose, pump, and float switch appear to be in working order, the problem of your Maytag dishwasher not draining might point to the control board or electrical issues. The control board acts as the "brain" of your dishwasher. It sends commands to all components, including the drain pump. If it malfunctions, it might not signal the pump to activate, leaving water in the tub.

Diagnosing a faulty control board can be complex. There are usually no obvious visual signs of damage. Sometimes, a power surge or electrical short can damage the board's internal components. If the dishwasher exhibits other unusual behaviors, such as incorrect cycle times or failure to respond to button presses, a control board issue becomes more likely. Before assuming a board failure, ensure the dishwasher is receiving proper power. Check your home's circuit breaker to make sure it hasn't tripped.

A quick reset can sometimes resolve minor electronic glitches. You can reset most Maytag dishwashers by simply turning off the power at the circuit breaker for five minutes, then turning it back on. If the issue persists after a reset and you have confirmed all other mechanical parts are functional, consulting a professional appliance technician is advisable. Replacing a control board is typically more involved and can be costly, making professional diagnosis worthwhile. Understanding electrical fundamentals helps when your [Maytag dishwasher is not getting water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-maytag-dishwasher-not-getting-water) or acting strangely.
