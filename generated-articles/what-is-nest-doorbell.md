## Nest Doorbell Models: Wired vs. Battery

Google offers different **Nest Doorbell** models. Each model serves specific installation needs. The primary distinction is between wired and battery-powered versions. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right one for your home. Both types deliver smart video doorbell functionality. However, their power sources dictate installation flexibility and some features.

The original Nest Hello, now known as the Nest Doorbell (wired), requires existing doorbell wiring. This means it connects to your home's electrical system. This continuous power supply allows for 24/7 continuous video recording with a Nest Aware subscription. This model is ideal if you have existing doorbell wiring. It ensures constant power and reliable performance. Installation involves connecting wires. [How to Wire Nest Doorbell](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wire-nest-doorbell) gives detailed instructions. You get consistent video history and don't worry about battery life.

The newer Nest Doorbell (battery) offers greater installation flexibility. It runs on a rechargeable battery. This means you do not need existing doorbell wiring. You can install it almost anywhere you need a doorbell. This is perfect for homes without traditional doorbell wiring or for renters. The battery version records events when triggered by motion or a doorbell press. It conserves battery life this way. The battery life varies based on activity. You will need to recharge it periodically. Interestingly, the battery Nest Doorbell can also be wired for continuous power.

Installation of the battery version is simpler. [How to Install Nest Doorbell Battery](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-nest-doorbell-battery) provides step-by-step guidance.

## Installation and Setup: Getting Your Nest Doorbell Ready

Setting up your **Nest Doorbell** is a straightforward process. The steps vary slightly depending on whether you have a wired or battery model. However, both aim for a user-friendly installation. First, you need to ensure your home Wi-Fi is strong at your door. A stable connection is crucial for seamless operation and video streaming. I always recommend testing your Wi-Fi signal first.

For the wired Nest Doorbell, you typically replace your existing doorbell button. This involves disconnecting the old doorbell and connecting the Nest Doorbell to the same wires. Safety is important, so remember to turn off power to your doorbell at the circuit breaker first. The Nest Doorbell comes with all necessary mounting hardware. It also includes instructions for connecting it to your home's chime. [How to Install Doorbell Nest](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-doorbell-nest) offers comprehensive guidance for this process.

If you choose the battery-powered Nest Doorbell, installation is even simpler. You do not need to deal with wiring. You just mount the doorbell to your desired location using the provided screws. Make sure the battery is charged before installation. The flexibility of the battery version means you can place it where it gets the best view. Once mounted, the next step for both models involves the Google Home app. You will use the app to add the device to your Google account. The app guides you through connecting the doorbell to your Wi-Fi network. It also helps configure initial settings. This includes naming your doorbell and setting up basic alerts. The app makes setup intuitive and quick. It gets your doorbell operational in minutes.

## Nest Aware Subscription: Unlocking Advanced Capabilities

The **Nest Doorbell** offers great features right out of the box. However, a Nest Aware subscription unlocks its full potential. Many users wonder if Nest Aware is required for their doorbell to function. The answer is no. Your Nest Doorbell will still send you motion alerts. You can still view live video and use two-way talk without a subscription. You get three hours of event video history. This means you can review clips from the past three hours.

Nest Aware significantly enhances your security and convenience. It provides an extended video history. The basic Nest Aware plan typically offers 30 days of event video history. This allows you to review events from a much longer period. This is helpful for investigating incidents or simply reviewing past activity. A higher-tier plan, Nest Aware Plus, offers 60 days of event video history. It also provides 10 days of 24/7 continuous video recording for wired Nest Doorbells. This is a crucial feature for comprehensive surveillance.

Beyond extended video history, Nest Aware adds intelligent features. Familiar Faces is one such feature. It learns the faces of people you know. This allows your doorbell to send you specific alerts, like "Dad is at the door." This feature helps differentiate between known visitors and strangers. It adds a personalized layer of security. Sound detection is another benefit. With Nest Aware, your doorbell can listen for specific sounds. These include glass breaking or dog barking. It sends you alerts if it detects these sounds. These advanced features provide a more comprehensive security solution. They give you greater peace of mind.

This seamless connectivity makes your smart home truly interconnected. It enhances convenience and expands your security network. I find this integration incredibly useful for my daily routine.

The Nest Doorbell works well with Google Assistant devices. When someone rings your doorbell, your Google Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max can display the live video feed. This means you can see who is at the door instantly. You do not need to reach for your phone. You can even use voice commands to interact with your doorbell. For example, you might say, "Hey Google, show me the front door." This voice control adds a layer of hands-free convenience. It is perfect when you are busy in the kitchen or another room.

Integration extends beyond Google's own devices. While Nest Doorbell does not directly work with Apple HomeKit, it integrates with many other smart home platforms through Google Assistant. It also works with smart speakers from other brands. For instance, you can link your Nest Doorbell to an Amazon Echo Dot.

It ensures you only get alerts for what truly matters. Setting up activity zones is also very useful.
