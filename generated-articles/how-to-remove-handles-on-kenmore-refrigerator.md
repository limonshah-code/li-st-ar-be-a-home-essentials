## Remove Handles On Your Kenmore Refrigerator

Have you ever faced the task of moving your Kenmore refrigerator, or perhaps performing a deep clean? Maybe you are replacing a damaged handle, or even considering changing its aesthetic appeal. I know it seems daunting at first. However, knowing **how to remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** models is a valuable skill. It makes tasks like moving the appliance through narrow doorways much simpler. It also helps with specific repairs or even just for thorough cleaning behind the handles.

This guide simplifies the process. I will walk you through the necessary tools. We will cover safety precautions. Then, we will explore various handle types commonly found on Kenmore refrigerators. You will get clear, actionable steps for each scenario. My goal is to make this job straightforward for you. By the end, you will feel confident tackling this project yourself. Let us get started on making your Kenmore refrigerator handle removal project easy.

### Takeaway

*   Identify your Kenmore refrigerator handle type first.
*   Gather necessary tools like screwdrivers or Allen wrenches.
*   Always disconnect power to the refrigerator before starting.
*   Work carefully to avoid damage to the handle or the door.
*   Store removed parts safely for easy reinstallation.

To remove handles on a Kenmore refrigerator, you typically locate screws or fasteners on the handle's ends. These may be exposed or hidden under caps. Use appropriate tools, such as a Phillips screwdriver or Allen wrench, to loosen and remove the fasteners. Gently slide the handle away from the door posts.

## Understanding Kenmore Refrigerator Handle Designs

Kenmore refrigerators come in many styles. Each style often features a different handle attachment method. Knowing your specific Kenmore handle type is the first step. This knowledge helps you gather the correct tools. It also ensures you use the right removal technique. I have learned that a little preparation here saves a lot of frustration later.

Many Kenmore models, especially older ones, use handles with exposed screws. These screws are visible on the top and bottom ends of the handle. They are usually Phillips head or hex head screws. Removing these is generally the simplest method. You just need to unscrew them.

Newer or higher-end Kenmore refrigerators often feature hidden fasteners. These handles look sleek because no screws are visible. The fasteners might be behind small plastic caps. These caps pop off. Other designs use set screws on the underside of the handle. These set screws secure the handle to a mounting post. A small Allen wrench usually removes these. Some handles simply slide onto mounting posts. They secure with a single screw at the very top or bottom of the handle. This screw often holds a trim piece in place that covers the mounting.

Another common design uses a bracket system. The handle attaches to brackets. These brackets then mount to the refrigerator door. You might need to loosen screws on the brackets themselves. Sometimes, the handle slides up or down to disengage from the bracket. Take a moment to inspect your refrigerator's handles. Look closely at the ends and along the underside. This visual inspection helps you identify the exact type of fastening. Knowing this makes the removal process much smoother. It helps you **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** effectively.

## Essential Tools for Kenmore Handle Removal

Before you start any project, having the right tools is critical. This principle holds true for removing Kenmore refrigerator handles. You do not want to stop halfway through because you lack a specific screwdriver. I always make sure my toolkit is ready. Gathering everything beforehand saves time and prevents damage.

Here is a list of tools you will likely need:

*   **Screwdriver Set:** A basic set with Phillips head and flathead screwdrivers is essential. Many handle screws are Phillips. Sometimes, a flathead helps gently pry open caps.
*   **Allen Wrench Set (Hex Keys):** If your Kenmore refrigerator handles have hidden set screws, you will need an Allen wrench. These screws are common on more modern or premium models. I recommend a set that includes various sizes. This ensures you have the correct fit.
*   **Plastic Pry Tool or Putty Knife:** For handles with decorative caps, a plastic pry tool helps. It lets you gently pop off the caps without scratching the door or handle. A thin putty knife can also work if you are careful. Avoid metal tools for prying if possible, as they can cause damage.
*   **Soft Cloth or Towel:** This is useful for protecting the refrigerator's surface. You can lay it down if you need to set tools or parts on the floor. It also helps clean the handles once they are off.
*   **Small Container or Magnetic Tray:** Keep all removed screws and fasteners in one place. A magnetic tray prevents screws from rolling away and getting lost. Losing a small screw can halt your project.

Having these tools at hand makes the process efficient. You will feel more prepared. This preparation helps you **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** doors with confidence. It ensures a smooth and safe procedure.

## Safety First: Precautions Before Removing Kenmore Handles

Safety is paramount when working with any appliance. This is especially true for large appliances like refrigerators. Before you even think about touching a screwdriver, you must prioritize your safety and the appliance's integrity. I always take a moment to ensure everything is safe before I begin.

First and foremost, **unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet**. This step eliminates any risk of electrical shock. Even though you are not working with electrical components directly, the refrigerator is still an electrical appliance. Accidentally bumping a wire or connection while working is a risk you should avoid. I make sure the plug is completely disconnected from the wall.

Next, consider the stability of the refrigerator. If you are removing a handle to move the fridge, ensure it is stable during the handle removal. You do not want the appliance to tip or shift while you are working. If your Kenmore refrigerator is on wheels, you might want to engage the wheel locks if it has them. For models without wheel locks, block the wheels to prevent accidental movement. You might also consider if removing the doors themselves would be beneficial for your project. Sometimes, handles need to come off to allow for full door removal. For more information on this process, you can consult our guide on [how to take Kenmore refrigerator doors off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-take-kenmore-refrigerator-doors-off).

Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Gloves can protect your hands from sharp edges or pinch points. Safety glasses are also a good idea. They shield your eyes from any debris or unexpected movements.

Finally, work in a well-lit area. Good lighting helps you see the screws and fasteners clearly. This reduces the chance of stripping screws or damaging components. It also helps you locate any hidden fasteners more easily. Taking these simple precautions ensures a safe and successful experience when you **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** appliances.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Removing Kenmore Refrigerator Handles (Exposed Screws)

Many Kenmore refrigerator models, especially older ones, use handles with visible screws. This is often the simplest type to remove. I find this method very straightforward, which is a relief when tackling appliance tasks. Let me guide you through the process step by step.

**1. Prepare Your Workspace:**
First, ensure the refrigerator is unplugged. As I mentioned, safety is key. Clear any items from the area around the refrigerator doors. This gives you ample space to work without obstructions. Place your soft cloth on the floor nearby. This acts as a safe spot for tools and removed parts.

**2. Locate the Exposed Screws:**
Examine the ends of the handle. You will see screws directly visible at both the top and bottom mounting points. These screws usually sit flush with the handle or the mounting bracket. They are typically Phillips head screws. Sometimes, they can be hex head screws, requiring an Allen wrench.

**3. Choose the Correct Screwdriver:**
Select the Phillips head screwdriver that fits the screws snugly. A correct fit prevents stripping the screw head. If the screws are hex head, pick the appropriate size Allen wrench. Test the fit before applying turning force.

**4. Unscrew the Handles:**
Begin by unscrewing the fasteners. Turn counter-clockwise to loosen them. It is often helpful to start with one end, loosening it slightly, then move to the other end. Then, alternate back and forth, loosening screws a little at a time. This prevents stress on the handle or mounting points. Be careful not to drop the screws. These small components can disappear quickly. I always put them immediately into my small container or magnetic tray.

**5. Gently Remove the Handle:**
Once all screws are removed, the handle should feel loose. Gently pull the handle straight away from the door. It might be attached to small mounting posts. It should slide off easily. Do not force it. If it resists, double-check for any missed screws or hidden fasteners. You might need to wiggle it slightly to free it from the mounting posts.

**6. Store Parts Safely:**
With the handle off, place it and all screws in your designated safe spot. This ensures nothing gets lost if you plan to reattach them later. This method makes it easy to **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** models with visible fasteners.

## Removing Kenmore Refrigerator Handles with Hidden Fasteners or Caps

Modern Kenmore refrigerators often feature sleek designs. These designs hide the screws for a cleaner look. This type of handle might seem more challenging to remove. However, with the right approach, it is just as manageable. I have found these handles require a bit more finesse.

**1. Power Off and Prepare:**
Always start by unplugging your Kenmore refrigerator. Ensure the area is clear. Have your plastic pry tool and Allen wrench set ready. Also, keep a container for the screws.

**2. Identify Hidden Fastener Locations:**
Hidden fasteners can be in a few places.
*   **Decorative Caps:** Many handles have small plastic or chrome caps on the ends. These caps cover the screws.
*   **Set Screws:** Some handles use set screws on the underside of the handle. These screws secure the handle to a mounting post.
*   **Slide-On Design with Hidden Screws:** Certain handles slide onto posts. A screw might be hidden at the very top or bottom of the handle, often covered by a trim piece.

**3. Remove Decorative Caps (If Applicable):**
If your handle has visible caps, use your plastic pry tool. Carefully insert the edge of the tool under the cap. Gently pry it up. The caps usually pop off with little effort. Be careful not to scratch the handle or door surface. Once the cap is off, you will see the screw underneath.

**4. Loosen Set Screws (If Applicable):**
For handles with set screws, look on the underside of the handle, near each end. You will see small holes. These holes contain hex (Allen) screws. Insert the correct size Allen wrench into the hole. Turn counter-clockwise to loosen the set screws. You usually do not need to remove these screws completely. Just loosen them enough for the handle to release.

**5. Access Hidden Screws (Slide-On Types):**
If you suspect a slide-on design, check the very top or bottom edge of the handle. There might be a single, small screw holding a trim piece. Remove this screw. Then, the handle should be able to slide up or down off its mounting posts.

**6. Detach the Handle:**
Once fasteners are loose or removed, gently pull the handle away from the door. It should release easily. If it resists, re-examine the attachment points. There might be an overlooked screw or a different fastening mechanism. Do not force it.

**7. Store All Components:**
Place the handle, screws, and any removed caps safely in your container. This method helps you successfully **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** models with hidden fasteners.

## Special Cases: Kenmore French Door and Side-by-Side Handle Removal

Kenmore offers many refrigerator styles. French door and side-by-side models often have unique handle designs. While the general principles apply, these specific models might have minor variations. I always pay closer attention when working on these larger units.

### French Door Kenmore Refrigerators

French door refrigerators typically have two handles. One for the fresh food section and one for the freezer drawer below. The fresh food handles are often similar to standard vertical handles. They may have exposed screws or hidden fasteners under caps. You would follow the steps outlined for those methods.

However, the freezer drawer handle can be different. Some freezer handles are integrated into the drawer itself. Others are mounted on the front of the drawer. These handles often have a stronger attachment. They need to withstand the force of opening a heavy drawer. You might find more robust mounting screws. These are often accessible from the inside edge of the drawer, or directly on the handle's ends. I have seen some designs where you lift a trim piece or rubber gasket to expose the screws. Always check the top and bottom inside edges of the freezer drawer handle.

### Side-by-Side Kenmore Refrigerators

Side-by-side Kenmore refrigerators have two full-length doors. One for the freezer and one for the fresh food section. Both handles are usually vertical. They typically attach in a similar fashion to each other. Many side-by-side models use handles with exposed screws on the ends. This makes removal straightforward.

Some modern side-by-side Kenmore models may use hidden fasteners. Look for the small plastic caps covering screws. Or, check the underside of the handle for set screws. You might also find a slide-on mechanism where a single screw secures a trim piece. My experience is that these handles are generally simpler than some French door freezer handles. They often do not involve complex internal mechanisms.

**Important Note for Both Styles:**
*   **Door Weight:** These doors are heavy. Be mindful of their weight when working near the hinges or if you consider removing the doors. If you need to move the refrigerator through a tight space after removing handles, you might also need to consider [how to remove Kenmore refrigerator door with water line](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-kenmore-refrigerator-door-with-water-line) if your model has one.
*   **Identify Your Model:** Knowing your specific Kenmore model number can help. You can often find service manuals online. These manuals provide detailed diagrams for handle removal. If you are unsure which Kenmore refrigerator you have, our guide on [how to tell which Kenmore refrigerator I have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-which-kenmore-refrigerator-i-have) can assist you. This ensures you **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** models effectively.

## Troubleshooting Common Kenmore Handle Removal Challenges

Sometimes, a project does not go as smoothly as planned. You might encounter a challenge when trying to **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** doors. Do not worry; most common issues have simple solutions. I have run into these problems myself, and I can share what usually helps.

**1. Stripped Screws:**
This is a frequent issue. If a screw head is stripped, your screwdriver cannot get a good grip.
*   **Larger Bit:** Try using a slightly larger Phillips head bit. Gently tap it into the stripped screw head with a hammer. This sometimes creates enough grip.
*   **Rubber Band:** Place a wide rubber band over the screw head. Then, press your screwdriver firmly into the rubber band and turn slowly. The rubber can fill the stripped area and provide traction.
*   **Screw Extractor Kit:** For severely stripped screws, a screw extractor kit is the best solution. These kits are affordable and designed for this purpose. You drill a small pilot hole, then use the extractor bit to back out the screw.

**2. Stuck Caps or Hidden Fasteners:**
Plastic caps might be stuck due to grime or age.
*   **Gentle Heat:** A hairdryer on a low setting can slightly warm the plastic. This makes it more pliable. Do not overheat the plastic.
*   **More Leverage:** Use a wider plastic pry tool or a thin, flat scraper. Apply steady, even pressure. Wiggle it slightly to break any seal.
*   **Check for Adhesive:** Some older models might have a tiny bit of adhesive. Gentle, persistent pressure usually works.

**3. Handle Won't Budge After Screws are Out:**
If all visible screws are removed, but the handle is still stuck, you might have missed something.
*   **Hidden Set Screws:** Double-check the underside of the handle, near the mounting points. Look for tiny holes for Allen (hex) screws. These are easy to miss.
*   **Slide-on Mechanism:** The handle might be designed to slide up or down a few inches before pulling free. Try pushing or pulling the handle vertically.
*   **Trim Pieces:** Some handles have decorative trim pieces that need to be removed first. These often snap into place or are held by a single small screw.
*   **Corrosion:** Over time, handles can slightly corrode onto the mounting posts. A little silicone spray (like WD-40, but wipe off excess) can help loosen it. Apply sparingly and wipe clean afterward.

**4. Damaging the Door or Handle:**
The goal is to remove handles without damage.
*   **Use Plastic Tools:** Always use plastic pry tools for caps. Metal tools scratch surfaces easily.
*   **Apply Even Pressure:** Avoid sudden, forceful movements. Work slowly and methodically.
*   **Protect Surfaces:** Use a soft cloth on the door if you are leaning tools against it.

By addressing these common issues patiently, you can successfully **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** appliances, even when facing a hiccup.

## Reattaching and Maintaining Kenmore Refrigerator Handles

Once you have successfully removed your Kenmore refrigerator handles, you will likely want to put them back on. Perhaps you are reinstalling them after a move or after replacing a broken one. Reattaching them is generally the reverse of removal. Proper reinstallation and simple maintenance ensure your handles last longer.

**Reattaching Kenmore Refrigerator Handles:**

1.  **Align the Handle:** Position the handle back onto its mounting posts. Ensure it lines up correctly with the screw holes or fastening points. It should slide smoothly into place.
2.  **Insert Screws/Fasteners:** For exposed screw handles, start by hand-threading a screw into each end. This prevents cross-threading. Once both are started, use your screwdriver to tighten them. Do not overtighten. Just make them snug. For hidden fastener handles, reinsert the set screws (if applicable) and tighten them. If it is a slide-on type, secure any hidden screws.
3.  **Replace Caps/Trim Pieces:** If your handle used decorative caps, simply push them back into place. They should snap securely. Ensure any trim pieces are properly aligned before securing them with their small screws.
4.  **Test the Handle:** Give the handle a gentle tug to ensure it is firmly attached. Open and close the refrigerator door a few times. Check that the handle feels stable and does not wobble.

**Maintaining Your Kenmore Refrigerator Handles:**

Regular cleaning and occasional checks extend the life of your handles.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Use a soft cloth and mild soap and water. Clean the handles regularly. This removes grime, spills, and fingerprints. Avoid abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals. They can damage the finish.
*   **Check Fasteners:** Every few months, give the handles a gentle wiggle. If you notice any looseness, check the screws. Tighten them slightly if needed. Loose handles can put stress on the mounting points. This leads to bigger problems over time.
*   **Inspect for Damage:** Look for any cracks, dents, or signs of wear. If a handle is damaged, consider replacing it. A damaged handle can be uncomfortable to use and might lead to accidents.
*   **Lubrication (Rarely Needed):** For handles that slide or have moving parts, a tiny bit of silicone spray can improve smoothness. Apply very sparingly, and immediately wipe away any excess. This is not typically needed for standard Kenmore refrigerator handles.

By following these simple steps, you can confidently **remove handles on Kenmore refrigerator** appliances and ensure they are reattached securely and maintained for years of use.
