## Unlocking Nook Rugs in Animal Crossing

Have you ever walked into a beautifully decorated Animal Crossing New Horizons home and wondered, "Where did they get that amazing rug?" You are not alone. Finding the perfect floor covering makes a huge difference in your island home. Many players want to know how to get Nook rugs in Animal Crossing. I remember the first time I saw a friend's exquisite rug; I immediately wanted one for my own living room.

This guide will show you all the ways to get rugs in your game. We will explore meeting special visitors, checking shops, and even making your own unique designs. Getting the right rugs transforms your spaces. By the end, you will understand every method available to acquire these essential decor items. You will soon have your dream rugs in Animal Crossing.

### Takeaway

*   **Meet Saharah:** She is the primary source for most unique rugs in Animal Crossing.
*   **Check Nook's Cranny:** The Twins occasionally sell smaller, common rugs.
*   **Use Custom Designs:** Design and place your own rug patterns anywhere on your island.
*   **Participate in Events:** Limited-time events sometimes offer exclusive rugs as rewards.
*   **Trade with Friends:** Exchange rugs with other players to expand your collection.

To get Nook rugs in Animal Crossing, primarily look for Saharah, the traveling camel merchant, who sells a variety of unique rugs in different sizes. You can also find smaller rugs at Nook's Cranny or create your own custom designs to place on your floors. Special events and trading with friends provide additional opportunities to expand your rug collection.

## Understanding Animal Crossing Rug Types

Rugs are important decorative items in Animal Crossing New Horizons. They add texture, color, and warmth to any room. These items also help define spaces within larger areas. My own home felt empty until I started adding rugs. The game offers many different types of rugs.

You will find rugs in small, medium, and large sizes. Small rugs fit under a single piece of furniture or in a small corner. Medium rugs are good for seating areas or dining spaces. Large rugs cover most of a room, creating a central design element. Each size offers different design possibilities.

Rugs come in various styles, from simple solid colors to intricate patterns. Some rugs feature cute animal motifs. Others have elegant floral designs. You can also find rugs that match specific furniture sets. These options help you create a cohesive look.

The quality and rarity of rugs vary. Some are common and easy to find. Others are quite rare and require patience to acquire. Knowing the types helps you plan your decoration efforts. Understanding these differences prepares you for your rug hunt.

## The Main Source: Finding Saharah for Rugs

Saharah is the most important character for finding unique rugs in Animal Crossing. She is a traveling camel merchant. Saharah visits your island randomly throughout the week. You cannot predict her exact arrival, but she will appear eventually. When she is on your island, you will see her wandering around.

Saharah sells various types of rugs, wallpapers, and floorings. She offers one small, one medium, and one large rug each time she visits. These rugs are often exclusive to her inventory. You cannot buy them anywhere else in the game. Her inventory changes with every visit, so check back often.

Finding Saharah means keeping an eye out for her distinctive appearance. She wears a colorful headscarf and carries a large backpack. Talk to her when you spot her. She will offer to sell you her wares. I always make sure to chat with her whenever she visits.

When you buy rugs from Saharah, she will give you Saharah Tickets. These tickets accumulate with each purchase. You can trade five Saharah Tickets for a special mysterious wallpaper or flooring. This adds another layer of excitement to her visits. Keep buying from her to get those special items too. Learning [how to get rugs in Animal Crossing New Horizons](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-rugs-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons) mostly means understanding Saharah's schedule.

### Saharah's Inventory and Buying Process

Saharah's inventory is a bit of a mystery, which adds to the fun. When you talk to her, she offers to sell you "mysterious" items. You do not know exactly which rug you will get until after you buy it. This element of surprise makes her visits exciting. I enjoy the anticipation of seeing what new rug I might uncover.

To buy a rug, simply select the option to purchase from her. She will offer a small, medium, and large rug. Each rug has a different price. Small rugs are generally the cheapest, while large rugs are the most expensive. You can buy multiple rugs of each size if you wish.

After buying, the rug instantly appears in your inventory. You can then place it in your home or on your island. Remember, her stock changes every time she visits. If you miss a rug you wanted, you must wait for her to return with new items. This makes her visits a priority for serious decorators.

Sometimes, Saharah will sell the same rug she sold before. This is part of the randomness. Do not get discouraged if you get duplicates. You can use duplicates in other rooms, give them to villagers, or sell them at Nook's Cranny. Every visit brings a new chance for rare finds.

## Nook's Cranny: An Occasional Rug Source

While Saharah is your main rug dealer, Nook's Cranny also sells rugs sometimes. The Nooklings, Timmy and Tommy, run this general store. Their inventory updates daily. You will find furniture, tools, and crafting supplies there. Occasionally, smaller rugs also appear on their shelves.

Nook's Cranny typically sells common rugs. These are often solid colors or simple patterns. You might find a simple green mat or a basic striped rug. These rugs are generally not as rare or unique as Saharah's offerings. However, they are reliable if you need a basic floor covering.

You must check Nook's Cranny every day. Their selection rotates quickly. If you see a rug you like, buy it immediately. It might not be there tomorrow. The prices at Nook's Cranny are also usually lower than Saharah's large rugs. This makes them a good option for players with fewer Bells.

I have found some nice basic rugs for my outdoor areas at Nook's Cranny. They are perfect for picnic spots or small lounge areas. Do not overlook this shop as a source, even if it is not the main one. It is a good way to supplement your rug collection.

### Daily Inventory Check-ins

Making a habit of visiting Nook's Cranny every day is important. The store opens at 8 AM and closes at 10 PM. You can quickly pop in and see what new items are available. I always do a quick run-through of the store's inventory. This ensures I do not miss anything good.

The rugs sold here are usually displayed on the floor or on a low shelf. They are easy to spot among the other items. You can preview what the rug looks like before you buy it. This helps you decide if it matches your decor. Take your time to consider each item.

Nook's Cranny also offers different items depending on your island's progression. As your island develops, you might see a wider variety of items. Keep upgrading your store to potentially unlock more options. This is part of the game's growth system.

Remember, Nook's Cranny rugs are often starter pieces. They are excellent for filling out rooms in your early game. They are also useful for customizing villager homes. If you want something truly special, Saharah is still your best bet.

## Custom Designing Your Own Rugs

If you cannot find the perfect rug, why not create it? Animal Crossing New Horizons lets you design your own custom patterns. You can use these patterns as rugs. This method offers endless possibilities for unique floor decor. I love creating custom designs because it lets me express my creativity.

To make a custom rug, open your NookPhone and select the Custom Designs app. Choose an empty slot and start drawing your pattern. You can use different colors, shapes, and tools. Be as simple or as detailed as you like. There are many tutorials online if you need inspiration.

Once you finish your design, save it. Then, select the design and choose the option to "Display on Ground" or "Display on Floor." This will place your custom pattern as a rug. You can place multiple custom designs next to each other to make a larger rug. This technique works for any size.

Custom designs are perfect for themed rooms or specific color schemes. You can create rugs that match your furniture or wallpaper exactly. You can even design character-themed rugs. This method allows for complete personalization of your home. It truly transforms how you get Nook rugs in Animal Crossing.

### Sharing and Downloading Custom Designs

You do not have to be an artist to have amazing custom rugs. The game allows players to share their designs. You can download patterns made by others. This feature is a game-changer for interior decoration. I have found many beautiful rugs through shared designs.

To access shared designs, you need the Able Sisters' shop. Once it is built, use the Custom Design Portal inside. You can search for designs using a Creator ID or Design ID. You can also browse popular designs. Look for keywords like "rug," "mat," or specific styles you like.

When you find a design you want, download it to an empty slot in your NookPhone's Custom Designs app. Then, you can place it just like any design you made yourself. This makes getting unique rugs incredibly easy. It opens up a world of creative options.

Remember to thank the creators if you appreciate their work. Sharing designs makes the Animal Crossing community vibrant. This method lets you get countless rugs without waiting for Saharah or Nook's Cranny. It is a fantastic way to personalize your island.

## Special Events and Nook Miles Redemption

Beyond Saharah and Nook's Cranny, special events sometimes offer exclusive rugs. Animal Crossing New Horizons celebrates real-world holidays and in-game seasons. During these times, unique items become available. Keep an eye on your in-game announcements.

For example, seasonal events like Toy Day or Festivale might feature themed rugs. These rugs often match other event-specific furniture. They add a festive touch to your home. You usually obtain these items by participating in the event activities.

Nook Miles Redemption also occasionally offers rugs. You earn Nook Miles by completing various tasks on your island. Visit the Nook Stop terminal in Resident Services. Browse the "Redeem Nook Miles" section. Sometimes, you will find special rugs or floorings here. These items are often Nook Inc. branded or have a natural, outdoorsy theme.

These event and Nook Miles rugs are often limited-time offers. If you see one you like, make sure to get it before the event ends. They might not return for a long time. I have missed out on a few items myself, so I learned to act fast.

### Trading and Community Engagement

The Animal Crossing community is very active. Players often trade items with each other. If you are looking for a specific rug, trading might be your best option. Many online forums and social media groups exist for trading.

You can post what rug you are looking for and what you have to offer. Other players might have a duplicate of the rug you want. They might be willing to trade it for something you have. This is a great way to complete your rug collection. I have traded many items with friends and online players.

Visiting other players' islands is also fun. They might have a Saharah or Nook's Cranny item you missed. You can also get inspiration from their decorating styles. Sharing your island design with others is a rewarding experience.

Always be safe when trading online. Only trade with trusted players. Make sure to agree on the terms of the trade beforehand. The Animal Crossing community is generally very friendly and helpful. Engaging with others enhances your game experience. This is another excellent way to get Nook rugs in Animal Crossing.

## Decorating with Your New Animal Crossing Rugs

Once you have acquired a collection of rugs, it is time to decorate! Rugs can completely change the look and feel of a room. They add personality and coziness. Think about where you want to place your new rugs. I always experiment with different placements.

Rugs work well in living rooms under coffee tables or seating areas. They can define a dining space, making it feel more intentional. In bedrooms, a rug beside the bed adds warmth to your feet. Even bathrooms can benefit from a small, decorative mat.

Consider the size and color of your rug. A large rug can anchor an entire room. Smaller rugs can highlight specific furniture pieces. Match rug colors to your wallpaper or furniture for a cohesive look. You can also use a contrasting color to make the rug a focal point.

Do not forget outdoor areas! Custom designs or simple mats are perfect for patios, gardens, or picnic spots. They add a touch of home to your island's exterior. You can create an inviting space for your villagers. Rugs are versatile decor items both indoors and out.

### Creative Rug Placement Ideas

Think outside the box when placing your rugs. You do not always need to place them perfectly centered. Sometimes, an off-center rug creates a more dynamic look. Try layering smaller rugs on top of larger ones. This adds depth and visual interest.

Use rugs to create zones in open-plan rooms. A large rug under a sofa and armchairs defines a living area. Another rug near a bookshelf can mark a reading nook. This helps make big rooms feel cozier and more functional. It helps separate distinct spaces.

You can also use rugs to simulate pathways or roads on your island. Custom designs are excellent for this purpose. Create stone paths or wooden plank designs. Place them on the ground to guide visitors through your island. This adds to the immersive experience.

Finally, do not be afraid to change your rugs often. Swapping them out for different seasons or moods keeps your home fresh. Experiment with different styles and see what you like best. Your island is your creative canvas, and rugs are a vital tool for expression.
