## Why Changing Your Rheem AC Filter Matters

Changing your Rheem AC filter is not just a suggestion. It is a vital part of home maintenance. The air filter traps dust, pollen, and pet dander. It stops these particles from entering your AC system. A clean filter ensures good airflow. This makes your air conditioner work correctly.

When a filter gets dirty, it blocks airflow. Your Rheem unit must work harder to pull air through. This increased effort uses more electricity. It raises your energy bills. A clogged filter also strains the system's components. This can lead to costly breakdowns. Regular filter changes prevent these problems.

A clean filter also protects your indoor air quality. It removes allergens and pollutants from the air you breathe. This is especially important for people with allergies or asthma. A dirty filter lets these particles circulate. This makes your air less healthy. You can breathe easier with a fresh filter.

Furthermore, a clean filter protects the internal parts of your Rheem air conditioner. Dust and debris can build up on coils and other components. This buildup reduces efficiency and causes wear. Changing your filter keeps your system clean inside. This extends its life. It saves you money on repairs. To understand more about the importance of this task, read [Why Should You Change Your Air Conditioner Filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-should-you-change-your-air-conditioner-filter). This routine is simple. It provides many benefits for your home and your wallet.

## Finding the Right Time: How Often to Change Your Rheem AC Filter

Knowing when to change your Rheem AC filter is important. It depends on several factors. General advice is to check your filter monthly. Change it at least every 90 days. This timeline can shift based on specific conditions in your home.

Homes with pets need more frequent filter changes. Pet hair and dander can quickly clog a filter. If you have multiple pets, change your filter every 30 to 60 days. This keeps your air clean. It also protects your Rheem unit. Smokers in the house also mean more frequent changes. Smoke particles are tiny. They build up fast.

If anyone in your home has allergies or asthma, change the filter more often. A cleaner filter reduces airborne allergens. This improves breathing comfort. During peak allergy seasons, consider monthly changes. This extra effort can make a big difference.

Usage also plays a role. If your Rheem air conditioner runs constantly, its filter will get dirty faster. Homes in dusty areas or during construction also require more frequent changes. Check the filter's appearance. If it looks grey and clogged, it needs changing. You do not have to wait for 90 days. A simple visual check is often enough. For more detailed guidance on frequency, see [How Often Should Air Conditioner Filter Be Changed](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-air-conditioner-filter-be-changed). This proactive approach saves you money and keeps your air fresh.

## Gathering Tools for Your Rheem AC Filter Change

Changing your Rheem AC filter is a straightforward task. You do not need many tools. Having the right items ready makes the process easy. The most important item is the new air filter. Make sure it is the correct size and MERV rating. Check your old filter for this information. It is usually printed on the cardboard frame.

You might need a pen and paper. Use them to write down the filter size. This helps when you buy replacements. A flashlight can be useful too. It helps you see into dark spaces. The filter slot might be in a poorly lit area. A flashlight ensures you can see clearly.

A pair of gloves is also a good idea. Old filters can be very dirty. They might contain dust, pet dander, and other allergens. Gloves protect your hands. They keep them clean. You might also want a trash bag. Use it to immediately dispose of the old filter. This prevents dust from spreading.

That is often all you need. You do not require complex tools. The process is designed to be simple for homeowners. Gather these items beforehand. This makes the filter change quick and efficient. You can get back to enjoying cool, clean air. Be prepared and the job becomes much easier.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Change Your Rheem Air Conditioner Filter

Changing your Rheem air conditioner filter is a simple process. Follow these steps carefully. You will complete the task safely and correctly. This helps your unit run well.

### 1. Turn Off Power to Your Rheem Unit

Safety comes first. Before you touch your AC unit, turn off its power. Go to your thermostat. Set the system to "Off." Then, find your home's circuit breaker box. Locate the breaker for your HVAC system or indoor furnace. Flip it to the "Off" position. This prevents any accidental start-ups. It protects you from electrical hazards. Confirm the unit is completely off. Do not skip this critical step.

### 2. Locate the Air Filter Slot

The filter slot location can vary on Rheem units. It is usually found in one of two places.
*   **Return Air Vent:** Look for a large grille on a wall or ceiling. This is common in homes with central return ducts. The filter is often behind this grille. You might see clips or latches to open it.
*   **Indoor Air Handler/Furnace:** The filter might be in a dedicated slot on your indoor unit. This unit is usually in a closet, attic, or basement. Look for a thin slot on the side or bottom of the unit. It often has a small door or cover. Check around the area where the main return duct connects to the furnace.

Once you find it, confirm it is the correct place. You should see the edge of the current filter.

### 3. Remove the Old Filter

Gently slide out the old filter. Note its direction. Filters have an arrow printed on the frame. This arrow shows the direction of airflow. The airflow arrow should point towards the furnace or air handler. It should point away from the return air duct. Make a mental note or take a picture. This helps you insert the new filter correctly.

Look at the old filter. It will likely be very dirty. This shows how well it has been working. It also shows why changing it is important. Immediately place the old filter in a trash bag. This keeps dust and allergens contained.

### 4. Check the Filter Size and MERV Rating

Before putting in the new filter, double-check the size. The dimensions are printed on the old filter's cardboard frame. It might say something like "20x25x1." Also, note the MERV rating. MERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value. A higher MERV rating means better filtration. For most homes, a MERV 8 to 11 is good. It balances air quality with airflow. You can learn more about filter types in [What Is The Best Air Conditioner Filter To Use](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-the-best-air-conditioner-filter-to-use). Use the same size. Consider a slightly higher MERV if indoor air quality is a concern.

### 5. Insert the New Filter

Unwrap your new Rheem air filter. Check for the airflow arrow. This is very important. Insert the new filter into the slot. Make sure the arrow points in the correct direction. The arrow must point towards the furnace or air handler. If it points the wrong way, air will flow inefficiently. This makes your AC work harder.

Slide the filter in smoothly. Ensure it fits snugly. There should be no gaps around the edges. Gaps allow unfiltered air to bypass the filter. Close any covers or secure any latches you opened earlier.

### 6. Restore Power and Test

Go back to your circuit breaker box. Flip the HVAC breaker back to the "On" position. Return to your thermostat. Set your Rheem unit back to your desired mode. Listen for the system to start up. It should run smoothly. You might notice an immediate improvement in airflow. The air might smell fresher. You have successfully completed the filter change. This simple task keeps your home comfortable.

## Choosing the Correct Rheem AC Filter Size and Type

Selecting the right filter for your Rheem air conditioner is key. The wrong filter can hurt your system. It can also reduce air quality. There are two main things to consider: size and type (MERV rating).

First, let us talk about size. Air filters come in standard dimensions. These dimensions are usually printed on the cardboard frame of your current filter. You will see three numbers, like 20x25x1. These represent length, width, and thickness in inches. It is crucial to use the exact size. A filter that is too small will leave gaps. Unfiltered air will pass through these gaps. A filter that is too large will not fit at all. Always buy the precise dimensions. Do not guess the size.

Next, consider the MERV rating. MERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value. It tells you how well a filter captures particles. Higher MERV ratings mean better filtration.
*   **MERV 1-4:** Basic filtration. Captures large particles like lint and dust mites.
*   **MERV 5-8:** Good for most homes. Captures mold spores, dust, and pet dander.
*   **MERV 9-12:** Better filtration. Captures fine dust, auto emissions, and some bacteria.
*   **MERV 13-16:** Very high efficiency. Captures bacteria, viruses, and smoke.

For most residential Rheem systems, a MERV rating between 8 and 11 is ideal. This range offers good air quality without restricting airflow too much. A filter with too high a MERV rating (e.g., MERV 13+) can sometimes restrict airflow. This makes your AC work harder. It can damage your system over time. Consult your Rheem manual if you are unsure about the highest MERV rating your unit can handle. A proper filter ensures your Rheem AC runs efficiently. It also keeps your indoor air clean.

## Solving Common Issues After Changing Your Rheem AC Filter

Sometimes, you might encounter issues even after changing your Rheem AC filter. Do not worry. Many problems have simple solutions. We will cover a few common scenarios.

One common issue is reduced airflow or the unit not turning on. First, double-check that you restored power. Go back to your circuit breaker and ensure it is "On." Also, check your thermostat settings. Make sure it is set to "Cool" and the temperature is below the room's current temperature. If the unit still does not start, recheck the filter installation. Did you insert it in the correct direction? The arrow must point towards the furnace. An improperly seated filter can cause issues.

Another problem might be strange noises. A new filter should not cause new sounds. If you hear whistling, the filter might not fit snugly. There could be gaps around the filter allowing air to leak. Re-adjust the filter to ensure a tight seal. Check the filter size again to confirm it is exact. An incorrect size can lead to air bypass and noise.

What if your Rheem air conditioner starts leaking water? This can sometimes happen if the system gets too cold or freezes up. A severely clogged filter restricts airflow. This can cause the evaporator coil to freeze. Even a new filter sometimes reveals existing issues. If your unit was struggling with a dirty filter for a long time, freezing could have already started. If your Rheem AC is leaking water, it warrants immediate attention. You can read more about this specific issue at [Why Is My Rheem Air Conditioner Leaking Water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-rheem-air-conditioner-leaking-water). Turn off the unit immediately. Let it thaw out. Then, restart it. If the leak persists, call a professional.

Always remember that regular filter changes prevent most major AC problems. If you encounter persistent issues, do not hesitate to contact a qualified HVAC technician. They can diagnose complex problems. Most of the time, filter changes are smooth. You will enjoy a well-running system.
