To clean Reef sandals, use a mild soap solution and a soft brush. Scrub the footbed and straps gently. Rinse the sandals thoroughly with clean water. Allow them to air dry completely away from direct heat or sunlight. This method removes dirt and odors effectively.

## Why Your Reef Sandals Need Regular Cleaning

Your Reef sandals work hard. They take you to many places. They face dirt, sand, and sweat. This exposure leads to grime buildup. It also causes bad odors. Cleaning your sandals regularly is important. It prevents these issues. It keeps your sandals hygienic. Neglecting cleaning can lead to material breakdown. It can also cause skin irritation.

Think about the footbed of your sandals. It absorbs sweat. It collects dead skin cells. This creates a perfect environment for bacteria. Bacteria cause unpleasant smells. Dirt and sand can also wear down the materials. They act like sandpaper. This shortens the life of your sandals. Regular cleaning removes these elements. It keeps the materials strong. It preserves the comfort and appearance of your Reefs.

Maintaining your sandals shows care. It is a simple habit. This habit saves you money. It extends the time you can enjoy your favorite footwear. It also ensures your feet stay healthy. Clean sandals mean happy feet. I make it a point to clean my Reefs often. It makes a big difference in how they feel and smell. A little effort goes a long way.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Reef Sandals

Before you begin cleaning, gather your tools. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. You likely have most items at home already. You do not need harsh chemicals. Simple household items work best. These supplies are safe for your sandals. They are also gentle on your hands.

Here is what you will need:

*   **Mild Soap:** Dish soap or a gentle hand soap works well. You can also use a mild laundry detergent. Avoid strong detergents with harsh chemicals. They can damage materials.
*   **Soft Brush:** An old toothbrush is perfect for scrubbing. A soft-bristled nail brush or a dedicated shoe brush also works. Ensure the bristles are not too stiff. Stiff bristles can scratch or damage surfaces.
*   **Small Bowl or Bucket:** This is for mixing your cleaning solution. It helps contain the mess.
*   **Clean Cloths or Sponges:** Use these for wiping and rinsing. Microfiber cloths are good.
*   **Warm Water:** Luke warm water helps dissolve soap. It also aids in cleaning effectively.
*   **Optional Items:**
    *   **Baking Soda:** Excellent for odor removal.
    *   **White Vinegar:** Helps with stubborn odors or mildew. It is also good for general cleaning, similar to how it cleans various surfaces around the home. Many people use vinegar for cleaning, from [bathroom surfaces](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bathroom-with-vinegar) to [glass](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-glass-with-vinegar).
    *   **Magic Eraser:** Good for scuffs on rubber soles.
    *   **Leather Cleaner/Conditioner:** If your Reefs have leather elements.
    *   **Suede Brush/Eraser:** For suede parts.

Having these items on hand saves time. It ensures a thorough cleaning. My cleaning kit for sandals is always ready. It makes quick work of dirty footwear.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Reef Sandals

Cleaning Reef sandals involves a few easy steps. This general method applies to most types. It removes surface dirt and refreshes your sandals. Always aim for gentle cleaning. Harsh scrubbing can harm the materials. Take your time with each step.

### 1. Pre-Cleaning Preparation

First, knock off loose dirt. Take your sandals outside. Clap them together gently. This removes sand and large debris. Use your hands to brush off any clinging dirt. A dry cloth can help too. This step prevents dirt from turning into muddy paste. It makes the deep cleaning easier.

### 2. Prepare Your Cleaning Solution

Mix warm water with mild soap. Pour about two cups of warm water into a bowl. Add a few drops of mild dish soap. Stir until suds form. You want a soapy solution, not excessive foam. This solution will lift grime. It will also help neutralize odors.

### 3. Deep Cleaning the Footbed

The footbed needs special attention. This is where most dirt and odors gather. Dip your soft brush into the soap solution. Gently scrub the entire footbed. Focus on soiled areas. Use circular motions. Do not press too hard. The goal is to lift dirt, not abrade the surface. For detailed guidance on this, you might check a guide on [how to clean the footbed of sandals](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-footbed-of-sandals). Pay attention to the arch and heel areas. These parts collect a lot of buildup.

### 4. Cleaning the Straps and Soles

Next, clean the straps. Dip your brush into the solution again. Lightly scrub the top and underside of the straps. Be gentle with fabric or leather straps. For rubber straps, you can be slightly firmer. Then, clean the outer soles. Remove any embedded pebbles or dirt. Scrub the textured areas well. This prevents tracking dirt indoors.

### 5. Rinsing Your Reef Sandals

Rinsing is crucial. It removes all soap residue. Soap left on sandals can attract more dirt. It can also irritate your skin. Rinse your sandals under cool, running water. Ensure all suds are gone. You can use a damp cloth to wipe them clean. Do this until the water runs clear. A thorough rinse prevents streaks and residue buildup.

### 6. Drying Your Reef Sandals

Proper drying prevents mildew and odors. Do not put your sandals in direct sunlight. Do not use a dryer or heat source. This can cause materials to shrink or crack. Instead, pat them dry with a clean towel. Then, let them air dry. Place them in a well-ventilated area. My method is to hang them up. This allows air to circulate around them. This takes several hours. Make sure they are completely dry before wearing them. This prevents new odors from forming.

## Cleaning Reef Sandals by Material Type

Reef sandals come in various materials. Each material needs specific care. Knowing your sandal's material is key. This ensures effective cleaning. It also prevents damage. I always check the material before starting. This helps me pick the right approach.

### Rubber and EVA Foam Reef Sandals

Many Reef sandals feature rubber or EVA foam. These materials are durable. They are also water-resistant. This makes them easy to clean. Use the general cleaning method described earlier.

*   **Cleaning:** Mix mild soap with warm water. Use a soft brush. Scrub the entire sandal. Pay extra attention to textured areas. These areas can trap dirt.
*   **Stains:** For scuffs, use a Magic Eraser. Rub gently. For tough stains, a paste of baking soda and water can help. Apply it, let it sit, then scrub. These materials resist most common stains.
*   **Drying:** Air dry completely. Do not expose them to extreme heat. High heat can warp rubber and EVA.

These types are robust. They handle a good scrub. You can often clean them with less worry. They dry relatively fast.

### Fabric and Canvas Reef Sandals

Fabric and canvas Reef sandals need gentle handling. They absorb water. They can also stain easily. My experience tells me quick action helps.

*   **Cleaning:** Create a mild soap solution. Use a soft cloth or brush. Gently dab and wipe the fabric. Do not soak the sandals fully. Soaking can damage glue or cause shrinkage. Focus on surface dirt.
*   **Stains:** Treat stains immediately. For general dirt, a laundry stain remover can work. Always patch test first. For oil stains, sprinkle cornstarch. Let it absorb the oil. Brush it off. Then clean normally.
*   **Drying:** Fabric takes longer to dry. Place them in a well-ventilated spot. Avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade colors. You can stuff them with paper towels. This helps absorb moisture. Change paper towels as they get damp.

Fabric can be tricky. It holds onto odors if not dried properly. Ensure thorough air circulation.

### Leather and Suede Reef Sandals

Leather and suede are delicate materials. They require specialized care. Water can stain them. Harsh chemicals can cause damage. Be very gentle. This is similar to [cleaning leather shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leather-shoes).

*   **Cleaning Leather:** Wipe leather straps with a damp cloth. Use a small amount of mild leather cleaner. Apply it with a soft cloth. Wipe in circular motions. Avoid excessive water.
*   **Cleaning Suede:** Suede should not get wet. Use a suede brush to remove dry dirt. Brush in one direction. For stubborn spots, use a suede eraser. Gently rub the spot. For detailed instructions, check how to clean [suede insoles of sandals](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-suede-insoles-of-sandals).
*   **Conditioning:** After cleaning leather, apply a leather conditioner. This keeps the leather soft. It prevents cracking.
*   **Drying:** Air dry away from direct heat or sun. For leather, stuff with paper to maintain shape. For suede, let it dry naturally. Once dry, re-brush suede to restore its nap.

Leather and suede require patience. They are worth the extra effort. They look great when cared for properly. I always test cleaners on a hidden spot first. This ensures no discoloration.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains and Odors

Sometimes, basic cleaning is not enough. Reef sandals can accumulate stubborn stains. They can also develop persistent odors. Do not despair. There are specific solutions for these problems. My goal is always to restore them to their best.

### Removing Tough Stains

Different stains need different approaches.

*   **Oil or Grease Stains:** For fresh oil stains, sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder. Let it sit for several hours. It absorbs the oil. Then, brush it off. Follow with a mild soap and water solution. For older stains on plastic or rubber, a degreaser can work. Always test in an inconspicuous area. This applies to [stains on plastic](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-on-plastic) as well.
*   **Mud or Dirt Stains:** Let mud dry completely. Then, brush off as much as possible. Use a stiff brush for this. Afterwards, clean with a mild soap and water solution. Repeat if necessary.
*   **Ink Stains:** For small ink marks, rubbing alcohol can work on rubber. Dab with a cotton swab. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. For fabric, try a laundry stain remover. Test it first.
*   **Dark Spots/Scuffs on Light Soles:** A Magic Eraser often works wonders. Dampen it slightly. Gently rub the scuff marks. Be careful not to damage the surface.

Patience is key with tough stains. Sometimes, a stain may not completely disappear. But you can often make it much less noticeable.

### Eliminating Persistent Odors

Odors are a common issue with sandals. They come from bacteria. These bacteria thrive in moist, dark environments.

*   **Baking Soda Method:** This is my go-to. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the footbeds. Let it sit overnight. Baking soda absorbs odors. In the morning, shake out the powder. Vacuum any residue.
*   **Vinegar Soak (for rubber/EVA):** For strong odors, mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Soak the rubber or EVA footbed for 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly. Air dry completely. Vinegar neutralizes odors. It also kills odor-causing bacteria.
*   **Essential Oils:** After cleaning and drying, you can add a drop of tea tree oil or lavender oil. Put it on the footbed. These oils have antibacterial properties. They also leave a fresh scent.
*   **Sunlight (Indirect):** After cleaning, placing sandals in indirect sunlight for a few hours can help. UV rays can kill bacteria. Do not leave leather or fabric in direct sun too long. This can cause damage.

I found that baking soda is the simplest and most effective. It is safe for all materials. It is a natural deodorizer.

### Dealing with Mold and Mildew

Mold and mildew can grow on damp sandals. They look like fuzzy spots. They also have a musty smell.

*   **Vinegar Solution:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Spray the affected areas. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Scrub gently with a soft brush. Rinse well. Dry completely. Vinegar kills mold spores. It also removes the smell. This method is effective for [mold off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes) in general.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** For small mold spots, make a paste with baking soda and a little water. Apply it to the mold. Let it dry. Scrub it off. This helps absorb moisture and remove mold.
*   **Bleach (for white rubber only):** A very diluted bleach solution can be used on white rubber. Mix 1 part bleach with 10 parts water. Apply with a cotton swab. Rinse quickly. Bleach can damage other materials and colors. Use with extreme caution.
*   **Prevention:** The best defense is proper drying. Always ensure your sandals are completely dry before storing them. Store them in a well-ventilated area. Avoid damp places.

Mold can be stubborn. Persistence is necessary. If mold persists, consider professional cleaning. Or, it may be time for new sandals.

## Drying Your Reef Sandals Properly

Proper drying is a critical step. It prevents new problems from starting. If sandals remain damp, they become a breeding ground for bacteria. This leads to unpleasant odors and mildew. It also shortens their lifespan. I learned this the hard way with a pair of sneakers. They smelled terrible because I rushed drying.

Here are the key points for drying:

*   **Air Dry is Best:** Always air dry your Reef sandals. This means no direct heat sources. Avoid hair dryers, radiators, or clothes dryers. High heat can warp rubber. It can shrink fabric. It can crack leather.
*   **Well-Ventilated Area:** Place your sandals in a spot with good airflow. A shaded outdoor area works well. An open room indoors is also suitable. Ensure air can circulate around them.
*   **Indirect Sunlight:** A little indirect sunlight can help kill bacteria. Do not leave them in direct, harsh sun for long periods. This is especially true for fabric and leather. Prolonged exposure can fade colors. It can also dry out materials.
*   **Absorb Excess Moisture:** For fabric or leather sandals, stuff them with newspaper or paper towels. This absorbs internal moisture. It also helps maintain their shape. Change the paper every few hours. Do this until it comes out dry.
*   **Sole Up:** Position your sandals so the footbed faces upwards. This exposes the wettest part to air. It allows for faster and more complete drying.
*   **Check for Dryness:** Do not put them away or wear them until they are completely dry. Feel all parts of the sandal. Ensure there is no lingering dampness. This may take 12-24 hours. Sometimes, it takes longer.

Rushing the drying process creates new issues. Taking your time ensures your Reef sandals stay fresh and last longer. This careful drying applies to shoes cleaned in a [washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer) too. It is a universal rule for footwear.

## Maintaining Your Reef Sandals for Longevity

Cleaning your Reef sandals is one part of care. Maintenance is the other. Good habits keep your sandals looking new. They also make cleaning easier next time. My own sandals last much longer now. This is because I follow these simple rules.

### Regular Spot Cleaning

Do not wait for a deep clean. Wipe down your sandals after each wear. Use a damp cloth to remove surface dust. This prevents dirt buildup. It keeps them looking fresh daily. A quick wipe takes seconds. It saves hours of deep cleaning later.

### Proper Storage

Store your Reef sandals correctly. Avoid tossing them into a pile. Store them in a cool, dry place. Keep them away from direct sunlight. Excessive heat and light can cause fading. They can also make materials degrade faster. If you live in a humid climate, consider storing them with a silica gel packet. This absorbs moisture.

### Rotate Your Footwear

Do not wear the same pair of Reef sandals every day. Rotate them with other shoes. This allows each pair to air out completely. It lets moisture evaporate. It also gives the materials time to recover. This prevents excessive wear and tear on one pair. It reduces odor buildup.

### Protect from Elements

Try to protect your sandals from harsh conditions. Avoid walking through deep mud if possible. Stay away from oily surfaces. If they get wet from rain, clean and dry them immediately. For leather sandals, consider a water-resistant spray. This adds a protective layer.

### Address Small Issues Promptly

Fix minor issues fast. If a strap loosens, repair it. If a seam starts to fray, mend it. Small problems can become big ones. Timely repairs extend the life of your sandals.

By combining regular cleaning with good maintenance habits, your Reef sandals will remain comfortable and stylish for seasons to come. It's about respecting your footwear and investing in its longevity. This approach is similar to maintaining other specialized footwear, such as [Oofos sandals](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-oofos-sandals) or [Tory Burch sandals](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-tory-burch-sandals), which also benefit from consistent care.
