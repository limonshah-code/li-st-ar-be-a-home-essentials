Do you remember the last time you washed your pillow? Many of us regularly wash our sheets, but pillows often get overlooked. Pillows collect dust mites, dead skin cells, and sweat over time.

## Understand Your Pillow Type: The First Step to Machine Washing

Washing a pillow in the washing machine starts with knowing what kind of pillow you have. Different materials need different care. You do not want to damage your pillow or your machine. I always check the tag first, this tells me if it is safe to wash.

Some pillows are perfectly fine for machine washing. Others, however, should never go near the washing machine. Knowing this difference saves you trouble. It helps keep your pillows in good condition for longer. This knowledge is key for proper pillow care.

### Checking the Care Label

Every pillow has a care label. This label gives you specific washing instructions. It tells you the water temperature to use and if machine washing is safe. You might see symbols for drying methods too. Reading this label is the most important first step.

Ignoring the label can ruin your pillow. It might shrink, clump, or lose its shape. Some labels say "spot clean only" or "dry clean only." Follow these instructions precisely. Your pillow will thank you for it.

### Pillow Types That Are Machine Washable

Many common pillow types handle machine washing well. Down and feather pillows are often machine washable. Synthetic pillows, like those filled with polyester fiberfill, also wash easily. These materials can withstand the agitation and water. They regain their shape with proper drying.

When washing these types, a gentle cycle is usually best. Use cool or warm water, not hot. This helps prevent shrinkage and damage to the filling. You will love how fresh they feel afterward.

*   **Down and Feather Pillows:** These natural fillings can go into the washer. Use a gentle cycle and mild detergent. Ensure they are completely dry to prevent mildew.
*   **Synthetic (Polyester) Pillows:** Most polyester pillows are machine washable. They are durable and bounce back well. Use a gentle cycle with warm water.
*   **Cotton Pillows:** Cotton-filled pillows can also be machine washed. Be careful, as cotton can clump. Use a gentle cycle and low spin.

### Pillow Types to Avoid Machine Washing

Some pillows should never go into the washing machine. Memory foam pillows are one example. The material can break down and crumble in water. Water also makes them very heavy and difficult to dry. This can damage both the pillow and your machine.

Buckwheat pillows also cannot be machine washed. The buckwheat hulls will get ruined by water. Always check the label for these specific types. Proper care ensures they last.

*   **Memory Foam Pillows:** Water destroys memory foam. It breaks down the material and makes it unusable. For [how to wash a memory foam pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-memory-foam-pillow), spot clean or air out. Learn more about specific types like [Can You Put a Tempurpedic Pillow in the Washing Machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-a-tempurpedic-pillow-in-the-washing-machine) to avoid mistakes.
*   **Buckwheat Pillows:** Buckwheat hulls absorb water and can become moldy. They also become very heavy. You need to empty the hulls to wash the cover. Read about [how to wash buckwheat pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-buckwheat-pillow) for the right method.
*   **Solid Foam Pillows:** Similar to memory foam, solid foam can degrade in a washing machine. It can also tear apart. Spot cleaning is the best approach.

## Gather Your Supplies: Preparing for Pillow Washing

Before you wash a pillow in the washing machine, gather everything you need. Having all supplies ready makes the process smooth. It helps prevent pauses or rushed steps. I always make a small checklist. This ensures I do not forget anything important.

The right tools help you clean your pillows effectively. They also help protect your washing machine. You only need a few basic laundry items. These items ensure a successful and gentle wash for your pillows.

### Essential Supplies Checklist

Here is a list of what you will need for your pillow washing day. Each item plays a role in getting your pillows clean and fluffy.

*   **Washing Machine:** Of course, you need a functioning washing machine. Make sure it is clean inside before starting. A clean machine helps ensure clean pillows.
*   **Mild Laundry Detergent:** Choose a liquid, gentle detergent. Powder detergents can sometimes leave residue on pillow fillings. Less is more with detergent for pillows.
*   **Optional Boosters:**
    *   **Borax:** A half-cup of Borax can boost cleaning power. It also helps deodorize pillows.
    *   **Baking Soda:** A quarter-cup of baking soda helps remove odors. It can also help brighten white pillows.
*   **Tennis Balls or Dryer Balls:** These are crucial for drying. They help fluff the pillows and prevent clumping. Use clean tennis balls, or dedicated dryer balls.
*   **Pillows to Wash:** Make sure they are approved for machine washing. Check the tags again if you are unsure. Prepare two pillows for each wash load.

## Pre-Wash Inspection and Treatment for Your Pillows

Before loading your pillows into the washing machine, a quick check is necessary. This step prevents small issues from becoming bigger problems. It ensures your pillows come out as clean as possible. I always take a moment to look at each pillow carefully. This small effort makes a big difference in the final result.

This pre-wash routine also helps your washing machine work efficiently. It avoids unnecessary wear and tear. Taking these steps sets you up for successful pillow cleaning. Your pillows will be cleaner and last longer.

### Check for Rips and Tears

Carefully inspect each pillow for any rips or tears in the fabric. A small hole can become a large tear in the washing machine. Filling might escape and clog your machine. This could damage the machine or make a big mess. If you find any small holes, mend them first. A quick stitch can save you a lot of trouble.

### Spot Treat Stubborn Stains

Do your pillows have noticeable stains? Maybe some yellowing or old spills? Spot treat these areas before washing. Apply a small amount of liquid detergent or a stain remover directly to the stain. Gently rub it in with a soft brush or your fingers. Let it sit for about 15 minutes. This helps break down the stain before the full wash cycle.

This pre-treatment increases the chance of stain removal. It avoids multiple washes later. Always use a stain remover safe for the pillow fabric. A clean pillow starts with tackling those tough spots.

### Remove Pillowcases and Protectors

Always remove all pillowcases and pillow protectors before washing. These items should be washed separately. Washing them together can prevent both the pillow and the protector from getting fully clean. It also adds too much bulk to the pillow load.

Pillowcases and protectors often have different washing needs. They might need a different water temperature or cycle. Separate them to ensure everything gets the proper cleaning it deserves. This simple step makes the whole washing process more effective.

## Loading Your Washing Machine: Best Practices for Pillows

Proper loading is essential when you wash a pillow in the washing machine. It ensures an even wash and protects your appliance. Incorrect loading can cause the machine to become unbalanced. This can lead to loud banging, shaking, and even damage. I always make sure the load is balanced. It helps my washing machine run smoothly.

This step might seem small, but it is critical. It helps your pillows get truly clean. It also prevents any undue stress on your machine's components. A well-loaded machine works more efficiently.

### Balancing the Load

For best results, always wash at least two pillows at a time. Place them vertically in the drum if you have a top-loader. Position them on opposite sides of the agitator. For front-loaders, place them on opposite sides of the drum. This balances the washing machine during the spin cycle. An unbalanced load can cause the machine to shake violently. It can even move across the floor.

Washing one pillow alone is usually not a good idea. It often causes the machine to become unbalanced. Two pillows provide the necessary counterweight. This ensures a smoother and safer wash cycle. A balanced load means a cleaner wash.

### Recommended Load Size

Do not overcrowd your washing machine with too many pillows. Overfilling prevents proper agitation and rinsing. The detergent might not reach all areas. This leaves your pillows less than clean. For most standard washing machines, two pillows are the ideal load. This applies whether you have a top-loading or front-loading machine.

If you have larger pillows or a smaller machine, wash one at a time if necessary. But if you wash only one, add a few towels to balance the load. The goal is to allow plenty of space for the pillows to move freely. This movement is necessary for effective cleaning. Getting the right load size is key for [how full a washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be) when washing pillows.

## Choosing the Right Cycle and Detergent for Pillow Washing

Selecting the correct wash cycle and detergent is vital. It determines how effectively you wash a pillow in the washing machine. The wrong settings can damage delicate pillow fillings. It can also leave behind soap residue. I always use a gentle approach for my pillows. This helps keep them soft and comfortable.

This part of the process directly impacts the longevity of your pillows. It also ensures they are truly clean and fresh. Choose wisely to protect your investment. A good wash cycle and detergent make all the difference.

### Delicate or Gentle Cycle

Always choose the delicate or gentle cycle on your washing machine. These cycles use less agitation. They are designed for items that need extra care. Stronger cycles can rip pillow fabric or clump the filling. The gentle action helps protect the pillow's structure. It ensures the filling stays evenly distributed.

A slow spin speed is also important. High spin speeds can put too much stress on the pillow. This helps prevent damage. Check your machine's settings for the gentlest option available. For example, if you have a GE washing machine, you would typically look for the 'Delicates' or 'Hand Wash' setting, as you would with [how to wash GE washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-ge-washing-machine) general care.

### Water Temperature for Pillow Washing

The water temperature depends on your pillow type and label. Most machine-washable pillows do well with cool or warm water. Hot water can cause some pillow fillings, especially synthetic ones, to clump or break down. It can also shrink cotton covers. Cool or warm water is gentler. It still effectively cleans and sanitizes.

Unless your pillow label specifically says hot water, stick to cooler temperatures. This preserves the pillow's integrity. It also helps prevent yellowing of certain pillow materials. A cooler wash is often just as effective.

### Minimal, Low-Sudsing Detergent

Use a small amount of mild, liquid laundry detergent. Too much detergent creates excessive suds. These suds can be hard to rinse out of a thick pillow. Leftover detergent can cause skin irritation or attract dust mites. Liquid detergent dissolves better than powder. This reduces the chance of residue.

I use about half of the recommended amount for a regular load. If you have an HE machine, use even less. Ensure the detergent is bleach-free. Bleach can damage pillow fillings and fabric. A little detergent goes a long way for pillows.

### The Importance of an Extra Rinse Cycle

After the main wash, run an extra rinse cycle. Pillows are thick and hold a lot of water and suds. An extra rinse ensures all detergent is thoroughly washed out. Leftover soap can lead to stiffness and residue buildup. It also makes pillows uncomfortable to sleep on. This step is often overlooked but is very important.

You want your pillows to be clean, not just smell clean. The extra rinse removes any hidden soap. This ensures your pillows are truly fresh. It is a simple step for a much better result. Just as you might run an extra rinse when performing a [self-wash on your LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-self-wash-lg-washing-machine) after cleaning its drum, ensure your pillows get the same thorough rinsing.

## Thorough Drying Techniques for Machine Washed Pillows

Drying is perhaps the most critical step after you wash a pillow in the washing machine. Incomplete drying leads to big problems. It can cause mildew, mold, and unpleasant odors. Your pillow can also become lumpy and uncomfortable. I always make sure my pillows are bone dry. This prevents any issues from developing.

Proper drying also helps your pillows regain their fluffiness. It ensures they are safe and healthy to sleep on. Do not rush this part of the process. Patience here pays off in the long run.

### The Importance of Complete Drying

Never put a damp pillow back on your bed. Even slightly damp pillows are an invitation for mildew and mold growth. These fungi thrive in dark, moist environments. They can cause respiratory issues and unpleasant smells. Mildew can also destroy the pillow filling. This makes the pillow unusable.

A completely dry pillow is a safe pillow. It feels fresh and remains hygienic. Take the time needed to ensure thorough dryness. This prevents any future problems.

### Low Heat or Air Fluff Setting

Place your pillows in the dryer on a low heat or air fluff setting. High heat can damage synthetic fillings. It can also cause down and feathers to scorch or clump. Low heat is gentle and allows for gradual drying. This helps maintain the pillow's shape and integrity.

If your dryer has an "air fluff" or "no heat" setting, use it. This setting circulates air without heat. It is the gentlest option for delicate fillings. It takes longer but is safer. Be prepared for multiple cycles.

### Tennis Balls or Dryer Balls for Fluffing

Add two to three clean tennis balls or dryer balls to the dryer with your pillows. You can put each tennis ball in a clean sock to prevent color transfer. These balls help to break up clumps in the pillow filling. They also help distribute the heat evenly. This makes your pillows fluffier and speeds up drying time.

The continuous bouncing of the balls helps air circulate through the pillow. This is especially helpful for down and synthetic fillings. They come out light and airy. This is my secret to perfectly fluffy pillows every time.

### Multiple Drying Cycles

Pillows are thick, and they hold a lot of moisture. One drying cycle is usually not enough. Run multiple drying cycles, checking the pillows frequently. Remove them every 15-20 minutes. Fluff them by hand and reposition them. Feel for any damp spots, especially in the center.

Continue drying until the pillow feels completely dry. There should be no signs of moisture or dampness. This may take several hours for thicker pillows. Patience is key to preventing mold and mildew. Do not stop until they are perfectly dry.

### Air Drying as an Alternative

If you prefer not to use a dryer, or if your pillow is delicate, air drying is an option. Place the pillows on a clean, flat surface in a well-ventilated area. Direct sunlight can help speed up drying and sanitize. Turn and fluff the pillows frequently. This helps them dry evenly.

Air drying can take a full day or more. Ensure good airflow around the pillow. This method is gentle and energy-efficient. It is a great choice for keeping your pillows in good condition.

## Maintaining Pillow Freshness: After Washing Care

Washing a pillow in the washing machine is a great start. But proper care continues even after drying. Regular maintenance helps your pillows stay fresh and supportive. It extends their lifespan. I believe in giving my pillows some ongoing attention. This keeps them feeling new for longer.

These post-wash steps ensure your efforts pay off. They help maintain hygiene and comfort. A little care goes a long way in preserving your pillows.

### Using Pillow Protectors

Once your pillows are clean and dry, cover them with a pillow protector. These zippered covers add an extra layer of defense. They protect against dust mites, allergens, sweat, and stains. Pillow protectors are easy to remove and wash regularly. This keeps the actual pillow cleaner for longer periods. They are a simple and effective barrier.

Consider waterproof or allergen-barrier protectors for extra protection. These are especially useful for allergy sufferers. A protector is a smart investment. It keeps your clean pillows truly clean.

### Regular Fluffing and Airing Out

Even without a full wash, pillows benefit from regular fluffing. Fluff your pillows daily when you make your bed. This helps redistribute the filling and maintain loft. It also helps air circulate through the pillow. This prevents moisture buildup and keeps the pillow feeling fresh.

Every few weeks, take your pillows outside on a sunny, breezy day. Let them air out for a few hours. Sunlight is a natural disinfectant. It helps kill dust mites and remove odors. This simple routine keeps your pillows in top shape between washes.

### Knowing When to Replace Your Pillows

Even with the best care, pillows do not last forever. Over time, fillings break down and lose support. An old pillow can lead to neck pain or poor sleep. A general rule is to replace pillows every 1 to 2 years. However, this varies by pillow type and quality.

To check if your pillow needs replacing, perform the "fold test." Fold your pillow in half. If it does not spring back to its original shape, it is time for a new one. For larger pillows like those found on [how to clean pillow top mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-pillow-top-mattress), assessing firmness and support is also important. Investing in new pillows when needed ensures continued comfort and hygiene.
