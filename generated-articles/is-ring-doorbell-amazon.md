### Is Ring Doorbell Amazon?

Yes, Ring Doorbell is an Amazon product. Amazon acquired Ring in 2018. This acquisition made Ring a part of Amazon's family of smart home and security devices. Ring now operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon. This means Amazon oversees Ring's operations, product development, and strategy.

### The Acquisition Story: How Ring Joined Amazon

The journey of Ring becoming an Amazon company is an interesting one. Ring started as a startup called Doorbot. Jamie Siminoff created it in 2013. Its goal was to create smart security for homes. He aimed to make neighborhoods safer. The first product was a video doorbell. It let you see and talk to visitors from your phone. This was a new idea at the time.

Doorbot faced challenges early on. Siminoff even pitched it on the TV show "Shark Tank." He did not get an investment deal there. Despite this, his vision for home security resonated with many. The company kept growing its customer base. It expanded its product line.

Amazon saw the potential in Ring's technology. Amazon had a growing interest in smart home devices. It also wanted to enter the home security market. Ring's video doorbells were already popular. They offered a direct way into people's homes. The acquisition made a lot of sense for Amazon.

In February 2018, Amazon announced it would acquire Ring. The deal was reportedly worth around $1 billion. This move was a big step for Amazon. It strengthened their position in the smart home space. It also added a significant security component to their ecosystem.

This acquisition allowed Ring to use Amazon's vast resources. It got Amazon's strong supply chain. It also gained Amazon's extensive customer reach. This helped Ring improve its products and expand its market share. Ring products now often feature "Works with Alexa" badging. This shows their close connection to Amazon. The acquisition changed Ring from an independent startup to a major player. It is now a key part of Amazon's smart home vision.

### Ring's Integration within the Amazon Ecosystem

The ownership by Amazon means Ring products work very well with other Amazon devices. This integration offers users a more connected smart home experience. Your Ring Doorbell becomes a central part of your home's security. It communicates with other Amazon-branded products. This makes managing your home easier.

One of the biggest benefits is the integration with Alexa. You can link your Ring Doorbell to an Amazon Echo Show or Fire TV. This allows you to see who is at your door directly on those screens. When someone rings the doorbell, a live video feed appears. You can also talk to the visitor using the device's microphone and speaker. For example, I often use my Echo Show to answer the door. I can simply say, "Alexa, show me the front door." This gives me instant visual access. You can learn more about how Amazon's devices interact with your doorbell by checking out our guide: [Does Amazon Ring Your Doorbell?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-amazon-ring-your-doorbell).

Voice commands are also very useful. You can ask Alexa to arm or disarm your Ring Alarm system. You can also ask her to review recent activity from your doorbell camera. This hands-free control adds a layer of convenience. It makes your smart home truly responsive. Many people find this feature incredibly helpful for quick security checks.

Ring devices also integrate with Amazon Key. This service allows secure in-home delivery for Amazon packages. If you have a compatible smart lock and a Ring camera, delivery drivers can leave packages inside. The Ring camera records the delivery process. This provides extra peace of mind for you.

The integration extends to various other smart home routines. You can set up routines where certain actions trigger others. For example, if your Ring camera detects motion, your smart lights could turn on. This creates an immediate visual deterrent. It also helps you see what is happening. The Amazon ecosystem ensures that Ring is not just a standalone device. It is a connected part of your broader smart home network. This unified approach simplifies security and automation for users.

### Core Features and Benefits of Ring Doorbells

Ring Doorbells offer a wide range of features. These features aim to enhance home security and convenience. Knowing what these devices can do helps you understand their value. Many people choose Ring for its reliable performance. They also appreciate its user-friendly interface.

**Key Features Include:**

### Ring Protect Plans: Subscriptions for Full Functionality

While Ring doorbells offer many features out of the box, some key functionalities require a subscription. These subscriptions are called Ring Protect plans. They unlock the full potential of your Ring device. Understanding these plans is important for anyone considering a Ring system.

The basic features, like Live View and motion-activated notifications, are free. You can always see who is at your door. You will also get alerts when motion happens. However, without a subscription, you cannot save or review video recordings. This means if you miss an event, you cannot go back and watch it.

**Ring Protect Plans Offer:**

*   **Video History and Recording:** This is the most significant feature. With a plan, your doorbell records every event. These recordings are stored in the cloud for a set period. You can then review, download, or share these videos. This is vital for security purposes. It helps you review suspicious activity.
*   **Person Detection (on some models):** More advanced plans offer smarter alerts. The doorbell can distinguish between a person and other motion sources. This reduces irrelevant notifications.
*   **Rich Notifications:** These notifications include a snapshot preview of the event. You see a small image of what triggered the alert directly on your phone. This helps you quickly assess the situation.
*   **Extended Warranty:** Some plans offer an extended warranty for your Ring devices. This provides extra protection for your investment.
*   **Professional Monitoring (for Ring Alarm):** The top-tier plan provides 24/7 professional monitoring for the Ring Alarm system. This means a monitoring center will respond to alarms. They can dispatch emergency services if needed.

There are different tiers of Ring Protect plans. The "Basic" plan covers a single device. The "Plus" plan covers all devices at one location. The "Pro" plan is for the Ring Alarm system and includes professional monitoring. Pricing varies based on the plan you choose. Many users find the video recording feature essential. It turns your doorbell from a live viewer into a comprehensive security camera system. Without a plan, you might wonder if your doorbell still makes a sound; for more on that, consider reading: [Will My Doorbell Still Ring with Ring?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-my-doorbell-still-ring-with-ring). I personally subscribe to a plan. I like knowing I can always go back and check recordings. It gives me great peace of mind.

### Privacy and Security with Ring Devices

Security is a primary concern for any smart home device. This is especially true for cameras and doorbells. Ring, being an Amazon company, has put measures in place to address privacy and security. Users must understand these features to use their devices safely.

Ring uses encryption for data transfer. This protects your video recordings as they go from the device to the cloud. They also offer two-factor authentication for your account. This adds an extra layer of security. It makes it harder for unauthorized people to access your account. I always recommend enabling two-factor authentication. It is a simple step that greatly improves security.

You have control over your privacy settings within the Ring app. You can adjust motion detection sensitivity. You can also define specific motion zones. This helps avoid recording public areas unnecessarily. You can also turn off the camera's audio recording if you wish. This provides flexibility for your privacy preferences.

Ring provides a "Control Center" in the app. This is a central hub for all your privacy and security settings. From here, you can:

*   **Manage Authorized Devices:** See which phones or tablets are logged into your Ring account.
*   **Link Accounts:** Manage connections to other services, like Amazon Alexa.
*   **Privacy Options:** Adjust settings for video recording and data usage.
*   **Event History:** Review all recorded events and manage your video clips.

Ring has faced scrutiny regarding data access and law enforcement requests. In response, they have made changes to increase transparency. They now provide a public portal. This portal shows the number of data requests from law enforcement. Users can also see if their data was shared. This increased transparency aims to build user trust.

It is important to secure your home Wi-Fi network. A strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router is crucial. This protects all your connected devices. Regularly updating your Ring app and device firmware is also vital. These updates often include security patches. They fix vulnerabilities. Taking these steps helps ensure your Ring Doorbell remains a secure part of your home.

### Choosing the Right Ring Doorbell Model
