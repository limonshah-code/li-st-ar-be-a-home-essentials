**Why isn't my LG dryer getting hot?** Your LG dryer may not be getting hot due to common issues like a clogged lint trap or blocked dryer vent. Other reasons include a blown thermal fuse, a faulty heating element or gas igniter, or a defective thermostat or thermistor. Power supply problems or control board failures can also prevent heat.

## Blocked Vents and Lint Traps Affect Heating

One of the most frequent reasons *why your LG dryer isn't getting hot* is a blocked airflow. Your dryer needs proper airflow to operate efficiently. When lint or debris builds up, it traps heat inside the dryer. This can cause the dryer to overheat. Safety mechanisms then shut off the heat. This prevents fires or damage to the appliance.

Maintaining clear vents and a clean lint trap is vital for both dryer performance and safety. I always start my troubleshooting here. It is the easiest and most affordable fix. Neglecting these areas also increases energy consumption. Your dryer works harder without achieving proper dryness.

### Inspecting the Lint Trap

The lint trap is the first line of defense against lint accumulation. It captures lint from your clothes during the drying cycle. You should clean this screen after every single load. Failing to do so restricts airflow significantly. This reduces drying efficiency and can cause your LG dryer not to get hot.

To clean it, simply pull out the lint screen. Use your fingers to peel off the accumulated lint. If there is a waxy buildup from dryer sheets, you can wash the screen with soap and water. Ensure it is completely dry before placing it back. A clean lint trap is a fundamental part of proper dryer function.

### Cleaning the Dryer Vent Duct

Beyond the lint trap, the dryer vent duct carries hot, moist air out of your home. Over time, lint can build up inside this duct. This blockage becomes a serious problem. It restricts airflow even more than a full lint trap. A severely clogged vent system is a major fire hazard.

You should clean the vent duct at least once a year. You can use a dryer vent cleaning brush kit for this task. Disconnect the dryer from the wall outlet and pull it away from the wall. Then, disconnect the vent hose from the dryer and the wall. Use the brush to clear out any lint. For deeper clogs, you might need a professional service. Proper ventilation ensures your dryer heats correctly and safely. Many of the reasons your LG dryer is not getting hot relate directly to airflow.

### Checking the External Vent Hood

The external vent hood is the final exit point for the dryer's exhaust. This hood is usually located on an exterior wall of your home. It often has a flap or grate to prevent pests from entering. Lint can accumulate around this opening and in the flap. This creates another potential blockage point.

Check this vent hood regularly. Make sure the flap opens freely when the dryer runs. Clear away any lint, leaves, or bird nests. A clogged external vent hood will prevent proper airflow. This can cause the dryer to cycle off its heat. It might also lead to longer drying times. Ensuring all parts of your vent system are clear helps resolve issues. It makes sure your LG dryer heats up efficiently.

## Faulty Thermal Fuse Prevents Heat

The thermal fuse is a crucial safety component in your LG dryer. It is a one-time use safety device. Its purpose is to blow, or open, if the dryer overheats. This prevents potential fires or damage to the dryer components. Once the thermal fuse blows, it cuts off power to the heating circuit. This means your dryer will likely tumble, but it will not produce any heat.

A blown thermal fuse is a very common reason *why your LG dryer isn't getting hot*. It usually blows because of restricted airflow. This brings us back to clogged vents or lint traps. Always check for airflow issues before replacing the fuse. Otherwise, the new fuse will likely blow again quickly. Replacing a thermal fuse is a straightforward repair for many DIYers.

### Locating the Thermal Fuse

The thermal fuse on an LG dryer is typically located near the heating element or the blower housing. Its exact position can vary slightly by model. Before you start, always unplug the dryer from the wall outlet. Safety is paramount when working with appliances. You may need to remove the back panel of your dryer to access it.

Once you remove the panel, look for a small, white component. It will have two wires connected to it. It often looks like a small plastic cylinder. Consult your LG dryer's service manual or an online diagram for your specific model. This will help you pinpoint its exact location. Identifying the correct part is the first step in successful diagnosis.

### Testing and Replacing the Fuse

To test the thermal fuse, you will need a multimeter. Set the multimeter to measure continuity (ohms). Disconnect both wires from the thermal fuse. Place one probe of the multimeter on each terminal of the fuse. If the multimeter shows an open circuit (no continuity), the fuse is blown. A working fuse will show continuity.

If the thermal fuse tests bad, you must replace it with a new one. Ensure you purchase a thermal fuse designed for your specific LG dryer model. Installation is the reverse of removal. Reattach the wires securely. Remember to address the underlying cause of the fuse blowing. This is usually a ventilation problem. Ignoring the root cause will lead to repeat fuse failures. This will also ensure your LG dryer continues to heat effectively.

## Damaged Heating Element or Gas Valve Causes No Heat

The heating element in an electric LG dryer or the gas valve and igniter assembly in a gas LG dryer is responsible for generating the heat. If either of these core components fails, your dryer will simply tumble cool air. This is a primary reason *why your LG dryer isn't getting hot*. Diagnosing these parts often requires some electrical or gas appliance knowledge.

These parts undergo significant stress during dryer operation. They are designed to heat up quickly and cool down. Over time, wear and tear can cause them to break. A visible break or a lack of continuity usually indicates a failed heating element. Gas valve issues can be more subtle, involving igniters or coils.

### Electric Dryer Heating Elements

In an electric LG dryer, the heating element is a coiled wire that glows red when electricity passes through it. It is usually located in a housing at the back of the dryer. If this coil breaks, electricity cannot flow through it. As a result, the element will not heat up. This is a common failure point due to repeated heating and cooling cycles.

To test the heating element, first unplug the dryer. Remove the back panel to access the element housing. Visually inspect the coils for any breaks or burnt spots. Use a multimeter to check for continuity across the element's terminals. A lack of continuity means the element is broken and needs replacement. Replacing a heating element is a relatively common repair. You can usually find replacement parts online or at appliance parts stores. Ensuring your dryer is getting enough power is crucial for the heating element. You may want to look at [Why Your Electric Dryer Heats Poorly](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-electric-dryer-not-getting-hot-enough).

### Gas Dryer Igniter and Gas Valve Issues

For gas LG dryers, the process of generating heat is different. It involves an igniter, a flame sensor, and a gas valve. If your gas dryer is not getting hot, the igniter is often the first suspect. The igniter heats up to ignite the gas flowing into the burner. If it is cracked or burnt out, it will not glow. This prevents the gas from igniting.

You can often observe the igniter through a small window or by carefully removing a panel. If it glows briefly but no flame appears, the flame sensor or gas valve coils might be the problem. The gas valve coils open the gas valve. If they are faulty, gas will not flow to the burner. Testing these components typically requires a multimeter. Replacing an igniter or gas valve coils can be more complex than an electric heating element. If you are not comfortable working with gas lines, it is best to call a professional technician.

## Malfunctioning Thermostat or Thermistor Issues

Thermostats and thermistors are crucial for regulating the temperature inside your LG dryer. They act as the "brains" that tell the heating element or gas valve when to turn on and off. If these components malfunction, they can send incorrect temperature readings. This can lead to the dryer not heating at all or heating improperly. A faulty thermostat might signal that the dryer is already hot enough, even when it is not. This prevents the heating cycle from starting.

There are typically a few different thermostats in a dryer. Each serves a specific purpose. Understanding their roles helps in proper diagnosis. A thermistor provides more precise temperature feedback. Both are vital for effective and safe operation. If your LG dryer is not getting hot, these parts should be on your checklist.

### Cycling Thermostat Problems

The cycling thermostat is responsible for turning the heating element or gas burner on and off. It maintains the desired temperature inside the dryer drum. If this thermostat fails, it can remain in an "open" position. This means it never completes the circuit for heat. Consequently, the heating element will not receive power. Your dryer will continue to tumble, but the air will remain cold.

You can test the cycling thermostat with a multimeter set to continuity. Disconnect the dryer from power. Remove the access panel, usually at the back. Locate the thermostat, which often looks like a small, disc-shaped component with two wires. If there is no continuity, the thermostat is defective and needs replacement. This is a common fix for a dryer with no heat.

### High-Limit Thermostat Safety Concerns

The high-limit thermostat is another critical safety device. It is designed to cut off power to the heating element if the dryer reaches an unsafe temperature. This prevents overheating and potential fires. If the high-limit thermostat fails in an "open" position, it will continuously prevent the heating element from turning on. This results in no heat in the dryer.

A blown high-limit thermostat often indicates an underlying airflow problem. Just like with a thermal fuse, addressing the root cause is important. Otherwise, the new thermostat might fail quickly again. Test the high-limit thermostat using a multimeter for continuity. If it shows no continuity, it needs replacement. You can typically find it near the heating element or the blower housing. For issues where your dryer gets too hot, rather than not hot enough, see [When Your LG Dryer Gets Too Hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dryer-getting-too-hot).

### Thermistor Reading Errors

Some LG dryer models use a thermistor instead of a traditional thermostat to monitor temperature. A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance changes with temperature. The control board uses these resistance changes to accurately control the dryer's heating cycles. If the thermistor is faulty, it can send incorrect temperature readings to the control board.

An incorrect reading might make the control board think the dryer is already hot enough. This prevents it from activating the heat. You can test a thermistor by measuring its resistance at room temperature. Its resistance should fall within a specific range according to your dryer's service manual. If it is outside this range, the thermistor is likely defective. Replacing a thermistor is usually a simple task. It involves disconnecting wires and removing a single screw.

## Defective Thermal Cut-Off Kit Impacting LG Dryer Heat

Many LG dryers, especially older electric models, use a thermal cut-off kit. This kit typically includes a thermal fuse and a high-limit thermostat. These two components work together as a safety pair. The thermal fuse is designed to blow at an extremely high temperature. The high-limit thermostat cuts power if the temperature exceeds a slightly lower, but still unsafe, level. If either component in this kit fails, your dryer will stop heating.

A complete thermal cut-off kit often needs replacement if either part shows a fault. It is common to replace both components at the same time. This ensures the entire safety system is new. This kit is a very common part to fail. It is a frequent answer to the question, "*why isn't my LG dryer getting hot?*"

### Understanding the Thermal Cut-Off

The thermal cut-off system protects your dryer from overheating. The thermal fuse is a non-resetting fuse. Once it blows, it must be replaced. The high-limit thermostat, on the other hand, is generally a resettable device. However, if it continuously trips, it might be faulty, or there's a persistent airflow problem. They are engineered to prevent fires.

When airflow is restricted, heat builds up inside the dryer. This heat then triggers these safety devices. They disconnect power to the heating element. This prevents further heat generation. If you find one of these parts has failed, always investigate the dryer's venting. A restricted vent is the most common cause of these components blowing or tripping.

### Replacement Process

Replacing a thermal cut-off kit is a common DIY repair. First, ensure your LG dryer is unplugged from its power source. Safety always comes first. You will typically need to remove the back panel of the dryer to access these components. They are often located near the heating element housing or the blower wheel.

Use a multimeter to test both the thermal fuse and the high-limit thermostat for continuity. If either one shows no continuity, the kit is defective. Purchase a replacement kit specific to your LG dryer model. Carefully disconnect the wires from the old components. Then, install the new fuse and thermostat. Reconnect all wires securely. Once installed, clear any potential vent blockages to prevent recurrence. This helps ensure your LG dryer heats properly again.

## Blown Thermal Cutoff Fuse and Control Board Failures

Beyond the thermal fuse and thermal cut-off kit, another specific fuse can fail, leading to your LG dryer not heating. This is often just called a thermal cutoff fuse. While similar to the thermal fuse, its specific placement or design might differ slightly. Its function remains the same: to prevent overheating by cutting power. When this fuse blows, it is a definitive reason *why your LG dryer isn't getting hot*.

Less commonly, but more seriously, the electronic control board can fail. The control board is the brain of your dryer. It sends commands to all components, including the heating circuit. If the control board malfunctions, it might not signal the heating element to turn on. This can be a tricky diagnosis, as the symptoms can mimic other component failures.

### Diagnosing a Blown Thermal Cutoff

A blown thermal cutoff fuse means the circuit is open. This stops electricity from reaching the heating component. You can test this fuse with a multimeter. Unplug the dryer from the power outlet. Access the fuse, usually located near the heating element or blower. Disconnect the wires leading to the fuse. Place the multimeter probes on each terminal. If the multimeter does not show continuity, the fuse is blown.

It is crucial to understand that a blown fuse is often a symptom, not the root cause. Excessive heat, typically from restricted airflow, caused the fuse to blow. Always clear your dryer's vents and lint trap. Inspect the blower wheel for obstructions. If you just replace the fuse without fixing the airflow issue, the new fuse will likely blow quickly. This can be a frustrating cycle.

### Electronic Control Board Malfunctions

The electronic control board manages all functions of your LG dryer. It processes sensor inputs and sends power to the various components. If the control board itself is faulty, it might not send the correct signals to the heating circuit. This can manifest as no heat, inconsistent heat, or other strange behaviors. Diagnosing a faulty control board can be challenging. Many symptoms can point to it.

A common sign of a failing control board is when other components test fine. For instance, if your heating element, thermal fuse, and thermostats all have continuity, but the dryer still does not heat, the control board might be the issue. Sometimes, you might see error codes displayed on the dryer's screen. These codes can point to specific board failures. Visually inspect the board for burnt spots or damaged components. Replacing a control board is typically more expensive than other part replacements. It can be a complex repair. I recommend getting professional help if you suspect a control board issue.

## Power Supply Problems and Circuit Breaker Trips

Your LG dryer needs a stable and complete power supply to generate heat. Electric dryers typically require a 240-volt dedicated circuit. Gas dryers need a standard 120-volt outlet for their controls and motor, plus a gas line. If the dryer does not receive the correct voltage or if its circuit breaker trips, it will not heat. The dryer might still tumble, as the motor often runs on a lower voltage or a separate circuit within the dryer. This can make diagnosing the no-heat issue confusing.

I once had my LG dryer tumbling but not heating. I thought it was a major component failure. It turned out to be a simple tripped breaker. Always check your power supply first. It is an easy and free diagnostic step. Ensuring proper electrical connection is fundamental for any appliance.

### Checking the Dryer's Power Cord

First, examine the power cord itself. Ensure it is fully plugged into the wall outlet. A loose connection can prevent the dryer from getting adequate power. Also, inspect the cord for any visible damage. Look for frayed wires, cuts, or signs of burning. A damaged power cord can interrupt the flow of electricity to the heating element. It also poses a safety risk.

If you find any damage to the power cord, it must be replaced immediately. Do not attempt to repair a damaged cord. Power cords for 240-volt appliances are specific and must be installed correctly. If you are unsure about replacing it, contact a qualified electrician. A secure and undamaged power cord is essential for proper dryer function.

### Resetting Circuit Breakers

Electric dryers, especially 240-volt models, use two separate circuit breakers. Both must be "ON" for the dryer to receive full power. If one of these breakers trips, the dryer's motor might still run. However, the heating element will not receive the 240 volts it needs to generate heat. This is a very common reason *why your LG dryer isn't getting hot*.

Go to your home's electrical service panel. Locate the circuit breaker labeled for your dryer. It is usually a double-pole breaker (two switches connected together). If it is in the "OFF" or middle position, push it firmly to the "OFF" position. Then, push it back to the "ON" position. If the breaker trips again immediately or frequently, there might be a more serious electrical issue with the dryer or your home wiring. In such cases, professional electrical inspection is needed.

### Ensuring Proper Voltage Supply

Even if the circuit breakers are on, the dryer might not be receiving the correct voltage. This could be due to issues with the wall outlet or the home's electrical system. You can use a multimeter to test the voltage at the wall outlet where the dryer plugs in. For an electric dryer, you should read approximately 240 volts across the two hot terminals.

If the voltage reading is incorrect or absent, the problem is with your home's electrical wiring, not the dryer itself. This requires a professional electrician to diagnose and fix. Do not attempt to work on your home's electrical wiring unless you are qualified. Ensuring your dryer receives stable and correct voltage is fundamental. It is necessary for the heating element to function properly and for your LG dryer to dry clothes effectively.

## Worn Drive Belt or Motor Issues Leading to No Heat

While not directly related to the heating circuit, issues with the drive belt or the motor can indirectly cause your LG dryer not to heat. This happens because most dryers have safety mechanisms. These mechanisms prevent the heating element from turning on if the drum is not tumbling. If the drum does not spin, the heat cannot dissipate properly. This would create a fire hazard. Therefore, if the drive belt breaks or the motor fails, the dryer might still power on but will not generate heat.

This situation can be confusing because the dryer may appear to have power. You might hear buzzing or clicking noises, but no drum movement. Always check for drum rotation when troubleshooting a no-heat issue. These mechanical components are just as important as the electrical ones for safe and effective drying.

### The Role of the Drive Belt

The drive belt is a long, thin rubber belt that wraps around the dryer drum, the motor pulley, and an idler pulley. Its purpose is to turn the drum. If the drive belt breaks, the drum will not spin. Your LG dryer will then operate without tumbling clothes. This lack of tumbling triggers the safety shut-off for the heating element. The dryer senses that the drum is not moving. It prevents heat from building up in one spot within the drum.

You can often hear if the drive belt is broken. The motor might hum or buzz, but you will not hear the familiar sound of the drum rotating. To confirm, open the dryer door and try to spin the drum by hand. If it spins very easily, with no resistance, the drive belt is likely broken. Replacing a drive belt usually involves removing the top and front panels of the dryer. This repair is common and replacement belts are readily available.

### Motor Overheating and Shutdown

The dryer's motor powers the drum rotation and the blower fan. The blower fan circulates hot air through the dryer. If the motor is failing or overheating, it can trigger internal thermal overload protectors. These protectors shut down the motor to prevent damage. When the motor stops, the drum stops. This, in turn, causes the heat to shut off due to the safety mechanism.

A motor can overheat for several reasons. Persistent vent blockages make the motor work harder to push air. Lint buildup around the motor can also cause it to run hot. Sometimes, the motor simply wears out. You might hear unusual noises from the dryer, like grinding or buzzing, before the motor completely fails. If the motor is running intermittently or shutting down after a short period, it might be overheating. Replacing a dryer motor is a more complex and expensive repair. It often requires professional assistance. This ensures your LG dryer functions correctly and safely.
