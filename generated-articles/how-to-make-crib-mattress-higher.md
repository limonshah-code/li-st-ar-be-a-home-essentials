### How do I safely make my crib mattress higher?

You make your crib mattress higher by adjusting the crib's built-in mattress support. Most standard cribs have several height settings. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions to select a higher position. This ensures the mattress remains secure and safe for your baby.

## Understanding Your Crib's Mattress Height Settings

Every crib has a design that allows for different mattress heights. This is a key safety feature. Manufacturers include these settings for your child's different developmental stages. Understanding these settings is the first step to properly adjust your baby's sleep space.

Most cribs come with a metal or wooden mattress support frame. This frame can attach to the crib at various levels. You will typically find at least three or four different height options. The highest setting is for newborns. It allows easy access for parents. As your baby grows and gains mobility, you lower the mattress. This prevents them from climbing out of the crib.

It is very important to use only the provided support system. Never try to create your own system to raise the mattress. This ensures the crib meets safety standards. Using unapproved methods can create unsafe gaps or an unstable surface. You want to make sure the mattress fits snugly.

Always check your crib's manual for specific instructions on how to change these settings. The manual contains vital information about your specific crib model.

## Why You Might Need to Raise a Crib Mattress

Many parents want to make crib mattress higher. This adjustment offers several benefits. It primarily caters to the needs of newborns and their caregivers. Understanding these reasons helps you decide if a higher mattress position is right for your family.

First, a higher mattress position makes it much easier to pick up and put down a newborn. Newborns do not move much on their own. They sleep many hours a day. With the mattress at its highest point, you do not have to bend over as far. This reduces strain on your back, especially during late-night feedings and diaper changes. Many parents find this a huge relief, particularly after childbirth. This convenience helps you handle your baby more easily and comfortably.

Second, a higher mattress position allows you to check on your baby with less disruption. You can see your baby clearly from a standing position. This helps you monitor their breathing and comfort. This is especially true if you are recovering from a C-section or have back issues. The ease of access provided by a higher mattress position makes infant care less strenuous. It promotes a more positive experience for both parent and child.
