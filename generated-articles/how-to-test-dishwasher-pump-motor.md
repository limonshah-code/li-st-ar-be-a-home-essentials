To test a dishwasher pump motor, first disconnect power and access the motor. Perform a visual inspection for damage or clogs. Then, use a multimeter to check the motor's electrical resistance (ohms) and continuity. This helps determine if the motor windings are intact or faulty.

## Understanding Your Dishwasher Pump Motor: Wash vs. Drain

Every dishwasher has at least two critical pump motors: the circulation (wash) pump motor and the drain pump motor. Each plays a distinct role in cleaning your dishes. Knowing their functions helps pinpoint the source of a problem. I will explain what each motor does and how they contribute to your dishwasher's performance.

The circulation pump motor, also known as the wash pump, is responsible for spraying water onto your dishes. It draws water from the bottom of the tub and sends it through the spray arms. A strong wash cycle depends entirely on this motor's proper function. If your dishes are not getting clean, this motor is a prime suspect.

The drain pump motor handles removing dirty water from the dishwasher tub. After the wash and rinse cycles, this motor activates. It pumps the water out through the drain hose. If water pools at the bottom of your dishwasher after a cycle, the drain pump motor likely has an issue.

Both motors are electrical and contain windings that can fail. They also feature impellers that can get clogged. Issues with either pump motor prevent your dishwasher from completing its job effectively. Learning to differentiate their symptoms is the first step in effective troubleshooting.

Symptoms of a failing circulation pump motor include weak spray, partially clean dishes, or a humming noise without water movement. For the drain pump motor, the main symptom is standing water in the tub. You might also hear a loud grinding noise during the drain cycle. Understanding these differences will guide your testing.

## Safety First: Preparing for Dishwasher Motor Testing

Before you begin any diagnostic work on your dishwasher pump motor, safety must be your top priority. Working with electrical appliances carries inherent risks. Ignoring safety precautions can lead to serious injury or damage to your appliance. I always ensure the power is off before touching anything.

The most crucial step is to disconnect the dishwasher from its power source. You can do this by unplugging the appliance from the wall outlet. If your dishwasher is hardwired, you must turn off the circuit breaker that supplies power to the dishwasher. Locate your home's main electrical panel and find the breaker labeled for the dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position.

Next, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Safety glasses protect your eyes from debris or splashes. Work gloves can prevent cuts and provide a better grip. These items are simple but make a big difference in preventing accidents.

Clear your work area around the dishwasher. Remove any dishes, cutlery, or other items from the tub. Ensure the floor is dry to prevent slips. You might need to pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet, so ensure you have enough space.

Having a helper can be beneficial, especially if you need to tilt or move the dishwasher. Moving a heavy appliance alone can cause strain or injury. A second person provides support and helps prevent damage to your floors or the dishwasher itself. Always take your time and do not rush the preparation steps.

## Tools for Effective Dishwasher Pump Motor Testing

Having the right tools makes the job of testing a dishwasher pump motor much easier and more accurate. I always gather my equipment before I start. Using the correct tools prevents damage to the appliance and ensures reliable test results. Let us look at what you will need.

A **multimeter** is the most important tool for electrical testing. This device measures voltage, current, and resistance. For testing pump motors, we will primarily use it to check for continuity and resistance (Ohms). Make sure your multimeter has fresh batteries for accurate readings. You can find out [how to test a dishwasher drain pump with an ohmmeter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-a-dishwasher-drain-pump-with-an-ohmmeter) for specific guidance.

You will also need a **screwdriver set**. This usually includes various sizes of Phillips and flat-head screwdrivers. Some dishwasher models might require a Torx head screwdriver. These are essential for removing access panels and motor mounting screws. Having a nut driver set might also be useful for certain fasteners.

**Pliers** are handy for gripping and manipulating wires or hoses. Adjustable pliers or needle-nose pliers can be particularly useful. They help you disconnect wire harnesses or stubborn hose clamps. Always handle wires carefully to avoid damage.

A **flashlight or headlamp** provides much-needed illumination in the tight, often dimly lit spaces under or around the dishwasher. It helps you clearly see components and connections. Proper lighting reduces the chance of making errors.

Finally, have some **rags or old towels** ready. Dishwashers involve water, and you might encounter spills during disassembly. Buckets or shallow pans are also useful for catching any residual water. This keeps your workspace clean and dry.

## Locating the Dishwasher Pump Motors: Circulation and Drain

To test your dishwasher's pump motors, you first need to find them. Their location varies slightly depending on your dishwasher's brand and model. Generally, both the circulation and drain pump motors are at the bottom of the dishwasher. I will guide you to their common positions.

Most dishwashers require you to remove the lower access panel to reach the motors. This panel is usually located at the very front, below the door. You will typically find a few screws holding it in place. Use your screwdriver to carefully remove these fasteners. Keep the screws in a safe place so you do not lose them.

Once the access panel is off, you will see the underside of the dishwasher tub. The **circulation pump motor** is usually the larger of the two. It is often located directly under the center of the wash tub. This motor is connected to the wash impeller, which creates the water pressure for the spray arms. It will have several electrical wires connected to it, often in a harness. You can learn more about [how to test a dishwasher motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-dishwasher-motor) in a broader context.

The **drain pump motor** is typically smaller than the circulation pump motor. It is usually found towards the front or side of the dishwasher, near the bottom. The drain hose connects directly to this pump. This motor's role is to eject water from the tub. You might see it attached to a filter housing or sump assembly.

Some dishwashers combine both pump functions into a single assembly. However, they usually still have separate motor windings for wash and drain cycles. Always refer to your specific dishwasher's owner's manual or service diagrams if you have trouble locating them. Familiarizing yourself with these parts ensures you test the correct component.

## Initial Visual Inspection: Signs of Pump Motor Trouble

Before diving into electrical tests, a thorough visual inspection can often reveal obvious problems. This step helps diagnose issues without needing tools like a multimeter. I always start here because it can save a lot of time. Look for physical signs of damage or obstruction.

First, check for any visible leaks around the pump motors. Water stains, rust, or puddles under the dishwasher indicate a seal failure or crack in the pump housing. A leaking pump motor might operate, but it will eventually fail or cause other issues. Even a small drip is a sign of trouble.

Next, inspect the wiring connected to both pump motors. Look for loose connections, frayed wires, or burn marks. Damaged wiring can prevent the motor from receiving power or cause intermittent operation. Secure any loose connections by gently pushing the connectors firmly into place. If you see burned wires, the motor might have shorted out.

Examine the motor housing itself for signs of physical damage. Cracks, dents, or melted plastic can indicate overheating or impact. Overheating often happens when a motor works too hard due to an obstruction or internal electrical fault. A damaged housing can also lead to water leaks.

Check for obstructions around the pump impellers. Debris like broken glass, food particles, or small foreign objects can get caught in the impeller. This prevents the motor from spinning properly. It often causes a loud humming noise as the motor tries to operate against the blockage. You might need to remove some hoses or covers to access the impeller. This is a common issue for both wash and drain pumps, but especially for drain pumps. For instance, you can learn [how to test an LG dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-lg-dishwasher-drain-pump) by checking for such blockages.

## Testing the Circulation (Wash) Pump Motor with a Multimeter

Once you have completed your visual inspection, it is time to perform electrical tests on the circulation pump motor using a multimeter. This test will determine if the motor windings are intact or if there is an open circuit. I will guide you through the process step-by-step.

First, ensure the dishwasher is still unplugged or its circuit breaker is off. Safety remains paramount during all electrical testing. Locate the circulation pump motor at the bottom of the dishwasher. You will need to disconnect the electrical wires from the motor. These wires usually attach via a plastic wiring harness. Gently unclip or pull the connector off the motor terminals.

Set your multimeter to the Ohms (Ω) setting, typically in the lowest range for continuity. Touch one probe of the multimeter to each of the motor's electrical terminals. The number of terminals can vary, but most motors have two or three. If there are multiple windings, you might need to test between different combinations of terminals.

A good circulation pump motor should show a low resistance reading, typically between 5 and 20 Ohms. This indicates continuity, meaning electricity can flow through the motor windings. If your multimeter displays "OL" (Open Line), "OFF," or a very high resistance reading, it means the circuit is open. An open circuit indicates a bad motor winding. This motor will not receive power and will not operate.

If the motor has a capacitor, you might also want to test it. A faulty capacitor can prevent the motor from starting. Capacitors store and release electrical energy to help the motor begin spinning. I can show you [how to test a heat pump capacitor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-heat-pump-capacitor), and similar principles apply to dishwasher capacitors. If the resistance reading is within range, the motor windings are likely good. Then, investigate other components like the capacitor or control board.

## Testing the Drain Pump Motor for Proper Function

Testing the drain pump motor is similar to testing the circulation pump, but with a focus on its specific role. This test helps confirm if the motor is capable of expelling water. I will walk you through the multimeter tests for this component. This is essential if your dishwasher leaves standing water after a cycle.

First, make sure the dishwasher is completely disconnected from power. Access the drain pump motor, usually located near the front or side of the dishwasher's bottom. Disconnect the electrical wiring harness from the drain pump motor terminals. Be gentle when pulling on the wires or connectors.

Set your multimeter to the Ohms (Ω) setting. Touch one multimeter probe to each of the drain pump motor's electrical terminals. Just like the wash pump, the drain pump typically has two or three terminals. Test between each relevant pair of terminals according to your dishwasher's wiring diagram if available.

A healthy drain pump motor should show a low resistance reading, usually between 10 and 30 Ohms. This reading confirms that the internal motor windings have continuity. If your multimeter displays "OL" (Open Line), "OFF," or an extremely high resistance value, the motor windings are open. An open circuit means the motor is faulty and needs replacement. For specific models, you can refer to guides like [how to test a Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-whirlpool-dishwasher-drain-pump) or [how to test a Bosch dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-bosch-dishwasher-drain-pump).

Beyond electrical resistance, consider a continuity test directly on the motor's internal thermal fuse, if present. Some drain pumps have an internal fuse that blows if the motor overheats. An open reading across the thermal fuse indicates it has tripped or failed. If the electrical tests show good resistance, but the drain pump still does not operate, visually check for clogs in the impeller or drain hose again. A simple clog can often be the real problem, even if the motor itself is fine. Checking for obstructions is a good follow-up.

## Advanced Troubleshooting: Checking for Obstructions and Capacitor Issues

Sometimes, a pump motor might test well electrically, but still not function correctly. In these cases, it is time to dig deeper into mechanical issues and other components. I often find that obstructions or a faulty capacitor are the hidden culprits. These steps are crucial for a complete diagnosis.

First, let us revisit obstructions. Even after an initial visual check, small items can be hidden. Remove the pump motor from its housing or at least get better access to the impeller. Carefully inspect the impeller for any debris lodged within its blades. This could include food scraps, broken glass, or even small plastic pieces. Even a small piece of plastic can prevent the impeller from spinning freely. Clearing these blockages can often resolve the issue entirely. Many models have similar designs, so learning [how to test a KitchenAid dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-kitchenaid-dishwasher-pump) could give you general insight.

Next, consider the start capacitor. Not all pump motors have one, but if yours does, it is vital for motor operation. A capacitor helps provide the initial jolt of power needed to start the motor spinning. If the motor hums but does not spin, a bad capacitor is a strong possibility. Disconnect the capacitor from the motor wiring.

To test the capacitor, set your multimeter to the capacitance (Farad) setting. Touch the probes to the capacitor's terminals. Compare the reading to the capacitance value printed on the capacitor itself. If the reading is significantly lower or higher, or if the multimeter shows no reading, the capacitor is likely bad. Capacitors can also swell or leak when they fail, so look for physical signs of damage. Replacing a faulty capacitor is often cheaper than replacing the entire motor.

Finally, check the motor's bearings. If the motor makes a loud grinding or squealing noise, the bearings might be worn out. While you cannot usually replace dishwasher motor bearings separately, this confirms the need for a new motor assembly. A stiff or seized motor shaft also points to internal mechanical failure.

## What to Do After Testing: Repair vs. Replace

You have tested your dishwasher pump motor and identified the problem. Now comes the decision: should you repair a specific component or replace the entire motor assembly? This choice depends on the test results, your skill level, and the cost. I can help you weigh your options.

If your tests indicated a simple issue like a clogged impeller, you are in luck. Clearing the obstruction is a straightforward repair. This is the least expensive fix and often restores full function to your dishwasher. Similarly, if only a start capacitor is faulty, replacing just the capacitor is usually an easy and affordable solution. Always purchase a capacitor with the exact same capacitance (uF) and voltage ratings.

However, if your multimeter tests revealed an open circuit in the motor windings, the entire pump motor assembly needs replacement. Motor windings are not typically repairable at home. In this scenario, you must purchase a new pump motor. Consider your comfort level with appliance repair. Replacing a pump motor involves more disassembly and reassembly. For brand-specific instructions, consider searching for guides like [how to replace an LG dishwasher pump motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-dishwasher-pump-motor) or [how to replace a GE dishwasher motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-ge-dishwasher-motor).

When deciding between repair and replace, also consider the age of your dishwasher. If your appliance is old and frequently breaks down, investing in a new pump motor might not be cost-effective. The money might be better spent on a new, more efficient dishwasher. Conversely, for a newer appliance, replacing the motor is often a smart investment.

Always compare the cost of a new motor assembly to the cost of a new dishwasher. Factor in potential labor costs if you plan to hire a professional. Many homeowners find replacing a pump motor a manageable DIY project. This saves you money on service calls. Make an informed decision based on all these factors.
