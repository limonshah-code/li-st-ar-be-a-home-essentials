## Where To Find Kenmore Dishwasher Model Number

Finding the model number on your Kenmore dishwasher is a key step for many tasks. Whether you need to order a new part, schedule a repair, or simply register your appliance, this number provides crucial details. It helps service technicians and parts suppliers identify the exact specifications of your dishwasher. Without it, you might struggle to get the right help or components. Knowing where this important information lives can save you time and frustration. We will show you the most common spots to check for your Kenmore dishwasher's model number. This guide covers all the typical hiding places, ensuring you find what you need quickly.

### Takeaway

Finding your Kenmore dishwasher model number is simple if you know where to look.
*   Check the door frame or edge first.
*   Look under the kickplate at the bottom.
*   Examine the sides of the tub.
*   Consult your owner's manual or purchase receipts.

The Kenmore dishwasher model number is typically found on a sticker or data plate. This plate is often located on the inner door frame, along the top or side edge of the door, or sometimes on the kickplate at the bottom of the appliance. You can also find it on the sides of the wash tub.

## Understanding Your Kenmore Dishwasher's Identification Needs

My Kenmore dishwasher is a central part of my kitchen. Knowing its model number feels like having a secret key to its maintenance. This unique identifier tells service professionals and parts dealers everything they need to know. It helps them understand the specific features and components of your appliance. Without this number, ordering replacement parts becomes a guessing game. Imagine needing a new spray arm or a door latch and not knowing which one fits.

Having the model number handy also streamlines warranty claims. Manufacturers rely on this information to confirm your purchase details. It ensures you receive the correct service or replacement under warranty. When you contact customer support, the first thing they ask for is usually the model number. This makes your interaction faster and more efficient. I always keep my appliance details in an easily accessible place for this reason.

The model number also helps with troubleshooting. Many online forums and manufacturer websites use model numbers to organize repair guides. If your dishwasher is making a strange noise, typing its model number into a search engine can often lead you to specific solutions. This proactive approach saves both time and potential repair costs. It turns a frustrating problem into a manageable task.

Furthermore, knowing your model number is useful when researching upgrades or new appliances. It allows you to compare your current model with newer versions. This helps you understand technological advancements and new features. You can make informed decisions about whether to repair or replace your unit. It is an essential piece of information for any homeowner.

## The Most Common Spot: Inside the Door Frame

The inner door frame is the first place I always check for a Kenmore dishwasher model number. This location is very common across many appliance brands. When you open the dishwasher door completely, look along the edges of the frame. You might find a sticker or a small metal plate here. This plate contains all the important identification information.

I often see these labels on the top edge of the door opening. Sometimes, they are on the left or right side of the door opening instead. Run your hand along these edges; the label is usually easy to spot. It is designed to be accessible when the door is open but hidden when the door is closed. This keeps it safe from daily wear and tear.

The label typically includes not just the model number but also the serial number. The serial number identifies the specific unit from its manufacturing batch. The model number identifies the product line itself. Both numbers are crucial for any service or part ordering needs. Make sure to write down both of them.

If the label is dirty or covered in grime, gently wipe it clean. Use a soft cloth and a mild cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the print on the label. The information needs to be legible for you to use it correctly. This small step ensures you get the exact details needed for your Kenmore dishwasher.

### Locating the Label on the Door Edge

The door edge is another prime spot for this important label. This refers to the side of the dishwasher door itself, not the main frame. When the door is slightly ajar or fully open, examine the perimeter of the door. The label might be subtly placed on the top, bottom, or side edge of the door panel. It is usually a paper sticker or a printed label.

This position keeps the label out of sight during normal operation. Yet, it remains easily viewable when you need to access it. Kenmore uses various designs, so the exact spot can differ slightly between models. I advise checking all four edges of the door. Use good lighting to make sure you do not miss it.

The label here is often smaller than those found inside the main frame. However, it still contains the complete model and serial numbers. Pay close attention to the text to avoid confusion. Sometimes, other numbers or barcodes are present. You are looking for the "Model No." or "M/N" designation.

I once helped a friend find their model number on a Kenmore dishwasher. It was tucked away on the lower-left edge of the door. We almost missed it because of how discreetly it was placed. This shows why a thorough check is always best. Take a picture of the label once you find it. This provides a clear record for future reference.

## Exploring the Kickplate and Lower Panel Area

If the door frame yields no results, my next target is the kickplate. The kickplate is the access panel located at the very bottom front of your dishwasher. It often blends in with your kitchen cabinetry. This panel usually sits just above the floor. It covers the dishwasher's internal components, such as the motor and plumbing connections.

You might need to remove the kickplate to see the label. This process is usually straightforward. Most kickplates are held in place by two or three screws. Use a screwdriver to carefully remove these screws. Then, gently pull the panel away. The label could be on the back of the kickplate itself, or on the lower frame of the dishwasher once the panel is removed.

I have found labels stuck to the metal frame directly behind the kickplate. Sometimes, they are on the floor of the dishwasher's compartment. Look for a sticker on the left or right side. It might be slightly hidden from direct view. A flashlight can be very helpful here to illuminate dark corners.

Remember to replace the kickplate securely after you finish. This panel protects the internal parts from dust and damage. It also helps with noise reduction. Always handle tools carefully to avoid scratching your floor or the appliance itself. Finding the model number here takes a bit more effort, but it is a common location.

## Other Potential Locations: Tub Sides and Top

Beyond the door and kickplate, Kenmore sometimes places model number labels elsewhere. I always check the sides of the wash tub. This is the main interior compartment where dishes are cleaned. The label might be discreetly placed on the left or right interior wall. It sits just inside the door seal. You will need to open the dishwasher door fully to see this area.

These labels are typically waterproof and resistant to detergents. They are designed to withstand the harsh environment of a dishwasher. Look for a small, rectangular sticker with clear printing. It is important to distinguish the model number from other internal part numbers. The model number will usually have "MODEL" or "MOD" before it.

Another less common but possible spot is the top edge of the tub. This area is usually covered by the countertop. It is not easily accessible without pulling the dishwasher out from its cabinet. I generally advise against moving your appliance unless absolutely necessary. If you have exhausted all other options, and you feel comfortable, you could gently slide the dishwasher out a few inches. This might reveal a label on the top front edge of the tub.

This location is more common for appliances that are installed in a fixed manner. Service technicians often check this spot during professional repairs. If you must check here, proceed with caution. Ensure the water and power are disconnected before attempting to move the appliance. Safety is always my top priority.

## Consulting Your Kenmore Dishwasher's Documentation

If physical inspection fails, I turn to the owner's manual. This often overlooked document is a treasure trove of information. Every Kenmore dishwasher comes with a user manual. This manual contains the model and serial numbers, usually on the front page or within the first few pages. It is printed there for easy reference.

I keep all my appliance manuals in a single folder. This makes finding specific details incredibly simple. If you cannot find your physical manual, check the Kenmore or Sears official website. You can often download a digital copy of your specific manual. You will need to search using either the appliance's name or a partial model number.

Another excellent source is your original purchase receipt or warranty card. These documents always list the full model and serial numbers. Stores include this information for their records and for warranty purposes. I file my receipts carefully, knowing they hold vital information like this.

If you bought your dishwasher online, check your order history. Most online retailers store purchase details for years. This digital record can be a lifesaver when the physical label is unreadable or missing. Even a credit card statement might show enough detail to track down the purchase. This documentation pathway is a reliable backup when the labels are elusive.

## Why the Model Number is Crucial for Parts and Service

My personal experience shows that having the correct model number for my Kenmore dishwasher makes all the difference. When I needed a new basket wheel, I simply gave the model number to the parts supplier. They quickly found the exact part I needed. This prevents mistakes and ensures compatibility. Using the wrong part can cause further damage or simply not fit.

For service calls, the model number allows technicians to prepare. They can look up your specific model before arriving. This means they bring the right tools and potential replacement parts. It saves time and prevents multiple service visits. Technicians can diagnose problems more efficiently with this information. It helps them provide accurate solutions.

Warranty claims rely heavily on this number. Manufacturers use it to confirm your appliance's age and coverage. Without it, your claim might be delayed or even rejected. Always register your appliance after purchase. This links your model number to your contact information, simplifying future support. It is a small step that offers big benefits.

Furthermore, safety recalls are often issued based on model numbers. If there is a known issue with a specific batch of dishwashers, the model number helps identify affected units. Manufacturers can then contact owners directly to arrange repairs or replacements. This protects consumers from potential hazards. It is a critical aspect of product safety. For other dishwasher brands, the same principle applies, such as knowing [how to find Whirlpool dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-whirlpool-dishwasher-model-number).

## Tips for Recording and Safekeeping Your Model Number

Once you find your Kenmore dishwasher's model number, recording it properly is important. I always take a clear photo of the data plate or sticker with my smartphone. This digital record is easy to store and access. It avoids any errors from transcribing numbers manually. Make sure the photo is well-lit and legible.

Next, I write down the model and serial numbers in a dedicated appliance logbook. This logbook includes purchase dates, warranty information, and any past service details. It acts as a central hub for all my home appliance data. A simple notebook works perfectly for this purpose. I make sure to write clearly and double-check the numbers.

Another good practice is to create a digital file. You can use a spreadsheet or a note-taking app on your computer or phone. Label the entry clearly, for example, "Kenmore Dishwasher Model Number." Include the serial number, purchase date, and where you found the label. This makes it searchable and prevents loss of information. Cloud storage ensures access from anywhere.

Finally, consider making a small label for yourself. Write the model and serial numbers on a piece of paper. Then, tape it to a non-obtrusive spot on the dishwasher itself. I often place it on the side of the cabinet, hidden from plain view. This provides a quick reference without needing to open doors or remove panels. This extra step ensures you are always prepared.
