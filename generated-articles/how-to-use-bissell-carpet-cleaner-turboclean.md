## How to Use Your Bissell Turboclean Carpet Cleaner

Keeping your carpets clean is a simple way to maintain a fresh and inviting home. A Bissell Turboclean carpet cleaner helps you achieve this with ease. This machine removes dirt and stains that regular vacuuming misses. It breathes new life into high-traffic areas and deeply soiled spots.

Understanding how to use your Bissell Turboclean is key to getting the best results. I will show you how to prepare your space, mix cleaning solutions, and operate the machine for effective cleaning. We will also look at spot treatment and proper machine maintenance. This guide helps you keep your carpets looking their best, making your cleaning tasks straightforward.

### Takeaway

*   **Prepare Your Area:** Vacuum thoroughly and move furniture before cleaning.
*   **Use Proper Solutions:** Only use Bissell-approved formulas with the correct water ratio.
*   **Follow Cleaning Steps:** Make slow, overlapping passes to ensure deep cleaning.
*   **Allow for Drying:** Ensure proper airflow to help carpets dry completely and prevent odors.
*   **Maintain Your Machine:** Clean tanks, nozzles, and brushes after each use for longevity.

To use a Bissell Turboclean carpet cleaner, first, vacuum your carpet well. Fill the clean water tank with warm water and the recommended Bissell cleaning formula. Plug in the machine and turn it on. Make slow, overlapping passes over the carpet, pressing the trigger for a wet pass and releasing it for a dry pass. Finally, empty and rinse the dirty water tank and clean the machine.

### Getting Ready: Preparing for Your Turboclean Session

Preparing your carpet and cleaning area is an important first step. This preparation ensures the Bissell Turboclean carpet cleaner works efficiently. It also protects your furniture and simplifies the entire cleaning process. Taking a few minutes to prepare helps you get the best possible clean.

Start by removing any small items from the carpeted area. Toys, loose papers, or decorative objects can get in the way of the cleaner. Put them away safely to avoid damage or obstruction during cleaning. This simple action helps prevent machine snags and ensures a smooth cleaning path.

Next, move furniture out of the way if possible. Couches, chairs, and tables should be shifted to uncover all carpeted surfaces. If an item is too heavy to move, you can place plastic sheets or aluminum foil under its legs. This protects the furniture from moisture and prevents wood stains on your carpet. Think about how much space you need to move freely with the cleaner.

A thorough vacuuming is crucial before using your Bissell Turboclean. Use your regular vacuum cleaner to pick up all loose dirt, dust, and debris. This step prevents small particles from clumping together during the wet cleaning process. It also helps the carpet cleaner focus on deep-set grime and stains. My experience shows that a good pre-vacuum makes a significant difference in the final result.

Consider also checking your carpet for specific stains. Pre-treating these spots can improve cleaning outcomes. Apply a suitable carpet pre-treatment solution to stubborn marks. Let it sit for the recommended time before starting with the Turboclean. This allows the cleaner to work more effectively on tough areas.

Finally, ensure you have easy access to a power outlet and fresh water. Make sure the outlet is safe and within reach of where you will be cleaning. You will also need a sink or tub to fill and empty the tanks. Proper preparation means you can clean without interruptions. It helps the whole process go smoothly. This readiness is a key part of using your Bissell carpet cleaner effectively.

### Mixing Solutions: Filling Your Bissell Turboclean Tank

Understanding how to properly fill your Bissell Turboclean carpet cleaner's tanks is crucial for effective cleaning. Using the correct cleaning solution and water ratio ensures optimal performance. It also helps protect your carpet and the machine itself. I have learned that precision here makes a big difference in cleaning power.

Your Bissell Turboclean machine has two main tanks: one for clean water and cleaning formula, and one for dirty water. You will focus on the clean water tank first. Always consult your specific Turboclean model's manual for exact instructions. Different models might have slight variations in tank design or fill lines. Following the manual prevents errors and ensures safety.

For the cleaning solution, only use Bissell-brand formulas designed for carpet cleaners. Other detergents or household cleaners can create too much foam. They might also leave sticky residues on your carpet or damage your machine. I have found that sticking to Bissell's own products gives the best results and keeps my machine running well. For more ideas on what to use, you can read about [what to put in carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-to-put-in-carpet-cleaner).

Most Bissell Turboclean formulas are concentrated. This means you need to mix them with water. Look for specific fill lines on your clean water tank. There will usually be a line for water and a separate line for the cleaning formula. Fill the tank with warm (not hot) tap water up to the water fill line. Then, add the Bissell cleaning formula up to its designated fill line. Warm water helps activate the cleaning agents better than cold water.

If you are using a highly concentrated formula, you might need to dilute it further. Some formulas are super concentrated and require less product. Always follow the instructions on the cleaning formula bottle for mixing ratios. If you are unsure about [how much liquid shampoo to add to a Bissell carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-liquid-shampoo-to-add-to-bissell-carpet-cleaner), the bottle's label is your best guide. This ensures you do not use too much or too little, both of which can lead to poor results. My experience tells me that correctly mixed solutions dissolve dirt effectively.

Once the tanks are filled, securely reattach them to your Bissell Turboclean machine. Make sure they click into place firmly. A loose tank can lead to leaks or poor suction during cleaning. Double-check all connections before you power on the machine. Proper tank loading is a simple yet vital step. For detailed guidance on this, consider exploring [how to load Bissell carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-load-bissell-carpet-cleaner). You are now ready to begin the actual cleaning process.

### Operating the Turboclean: Deep Cleaning Your Carpets

With your Bissell Turboclean carpet cleaner prepared and tanks filled, you are ready to start deep cleaning. Operating the machine effectively requires a steady hand and attention to detail. This process removes deep-seated dirt and brings your carpets back to life. I find that a systematic approach yields the best results.

First, plug your Bissell Turboclean into a grounded electrical outlet. Ensure the power cord is clear of your cleaning path to prevent tripping or entanglement. Turn on the machine using its power switch, typically located on the body or handle. You will hear the motor start, indicating it is ready for use. My machine always gives a confident hum when powered on.

To begin cleaning, hold down the spray trigger on the handle as you make a slow, forward pass. This action releases the cleaning solution onto the carpet. Overlap each pass slightly to ensure no areas are missed. Think of it like mowing a lawn, covering every strip. The slow movement allows the solution to penetrate the carpet fibers. It gives the rotating brushes time to scrub away the dirt.

After making a forward wet pass, release the spray trigger. Then, make a slow, backward pass over the same area. This backward pass is crucial for suctioning up the dirty water and cleaning solution from the carpet. The Turboclean works by spraying and then extracting, not by using steam. If you want to understand more about this mechanism, you can learn [how does Bissell carpet cleaner work without using steam](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-does-bissell-carpet-cleaner-work-without-using-steam). You will notice the dirty water tank filling up as you work.

Repeat the wet forward pass and dry backward pass sequence for each section of your carpet. Continue until the dirty water being pulled into the tank appears lighter or clearer. This indicates that most of the soil has been removed from that area. For heavily soiled areas, you might need to make a few extra passes. Do not oversaturate the carpet. Excessive moisture can prolong drying times and potentially lead to mildew.

As you clean, periodically check the dirty water tank. When it reaches its "full" line, or if you notice a decrease in suction, it is time to empty it. Turn off the machine, remove the dirty water tank, and pour its contents into a sink or toilet. Rinse the tank thoroughly with clean water before reattaching it. This simple step maintains the machine's efficiency. Keeping an eye on the tanks ensures continuous cleaning.

### Targeting Stains: Using Attachments and Spot Cleaning

Dealing with stubborn spots and high-traffic stains requires specific techniques beyond general cleaning. Your Bissell Turboclean carpet cleaner often comes with attachments that make this easier. These tools allow for focused cleaning, helping to lift tough marks without saturating the entire carpet. I have found them indispensable for targeting specific problem areas.

Many Turboclean models include a hose and a small upholstery or stain tool. This attachment is perfect for reaching awkward spots. It works well on stairs, pet beds, or furniture where the main cleaner cannot go. To use it, simply attach the hose to the designated port on your machine. Then, attach the stain tool to the end of the hose. My machine makes a clear click when the hose is secure.

Before using the attachment, consider pre-treating the stain. Apply a small amount of Bissell pre-treatment solution directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes, as directed on the product label. This allows the cleaner to break down the stain's components. Pre-treatment significantly increases the chances of complete removal.

When using the attachment, hold the tool firmly against the stained area. Press the spray trigger to release solution while pulling the tool slowly over the spot. Release the trigger and pull the tool back over the same spot to suction up the dirty water. Repeat this back-and-forth motion until the stain starts to fade. You might need several passes for truly stubborn marks. Ensure you do not scrub too hard, which can damage carpet fibers.

For particularly tough or older stains, you may need to apply a bit more solution. Let it sit for an extra minute or two before extracting. Gently agitate the stain with the brush on the attachment, but do not rub excessively. The goal is to lift the stain, not push it deeper into the carpet. Seeing the dirty water disappear into the tank is always satisfying.

Remember to only use Bissell-approved spot and stain formulas with your Turboclean. Using other chemicals can void your warranty or damage your machine. Some chemicals, like bleach, should never be used in your cleaner. You can find more information about this in articles like "[Can I use bleach in my Bissell carpet cleaner?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-bleach-in-my-bissell-carpet-cleaner)". After treating a stain, make sure to thoroughly extract all moisture from the area. This prevents re-soiling and helps the carpet dry faster. My Turboclean with its tools makes short work of most spots.

### Post-Cleaning Care: Drying and Fan Assistance

After deep cleaning your carpets with the Bissell Turboclean, proper drying is a critical step. Failing to dry carpets completely can lead to several problems. These include mildew growth, unpleasant odors, and re-soiling. Ensuring good airflow helps your carpets dry faster and stay fresh. I always prioritize this step for the best outcomes.

First, make a few extra dry passes over the cleaned areas with your Bissell Turboclean. Do not press the spray trigger during these passes. This helps to extract as much remaining moisture as possible from the carpet fibers. The more water you can pull out initially, the faster your carpets will dry. This simple action makes a big difference.

Next, open windows and doors in the cleaned rooms if the weather permits. Fresh air circulation is one of the most effective ways to speed up drying. It helps to carry away moisture from the carpet surface. If the weather is humid or cold, consider using fans. Box fans, pedestal fans, or even ceiling fans can dramatically improve airflow across the carpet. I often set up a few fans pointing directly at the cleaned areas.

You can also use a dehumidifier if you have one available. A dehumidifier pulls moisture directly from the air, further accelerating the drying process. Place it in the center of the cleaned room. Empty its water reservoir regularly. This combination of air circulation and moisture removal creates an ideal drying environment.

Avoid walking on the damp carpets until they are completely dry. Walking on wet fibers can re-deposit dirt from shoes. It can also flatten the carpet pile, making it look less fluffy. If you must walk on it, wear clean socks or shoe covers. This minimizes re-contamination. I always tell my family to avoid the cleaned areas for a few hours.

Drying time can vary based on several factors. These include carpet thickness, the amount of solution used, humidity levels, and airflow. Generally, carpets can take anywhere from 4 to 12 hours to dry completely. For very thick carpets or humid conditions, it might take longer. Use your hand to feel the carpet. It should feel completely dry to the touch before you replace furniture or allow heavy foot traffic. Patience during this phase prevents future issues.

Once your carpets are dry, give them one final vacuuming. This helps to lift the carpet pile. It also removes any loosened dirt that might have surfaced during the drying process. This final touch leaves your carpets looking pristine and feeling soft. Proper drying completes the cleaning cycle beautifully.

### Maintaining Your Turboclean: Cleaning and Storage

Proper maintenance of your Bissell Turboclean carpet cleaner is essential for its longevity and performance. Cleaning the machine after each use prevents clogs, odors, and bacterial growth. It also ensures the machine is ready for your next cleaning job. I have found that a little effort after each use saves a lot of trouble later.

The first step after finishing your cleaning session is to empty both tanks. Remove the dirty water tank and discard its contents. Rinse it thoroughly with warm water. You can add a small amount of clean water to the tank, shake it, and pour it out a few times. This removes any lingering dirty water or residue. Do the same for the clean water tank to prevent any solution from drying inside.

Next, focus on the nozzle and brush rolls. The nozzle is where the dirty water is extracted, and it can become clogged with debris. Most Bissell Turboclean models have a removable nozzle. Detach it carefully and rinse it under running water. Use a soft brush or cloth to remove any hair, lint, or stubborn dirt stuck in the suction path. A clean nozzle ensures strong suction for future cleanings.

The brush rolls are responsible for scrubbing your carpets. They can collect hair and fibers, which affects their cleaning efficiency. Some Turboclean models allow for easy removal of the brush rolls. If yours are removable, take them out and clean off any tangled hair or debris. If they are not removable, use scissors to carefully cut away hair wrapped around them. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the brush housing area. Ensuring your brushes are clean means they can properly agitate the carpet fibers.

After cleaning the tanks, nozzle, and brushes, wipe down the exterior of the machine. Use a damp cloth to remove any splashes or drips of dirty water or solution. Make sure the power cord is clean and wrap it neatly for storage. Leaving the tanks slightly ajar to air dry completely before reassembling the machine is a good practice. This prevents mildew smells from developing inside the tanks.

Store your Bissell Turboclean in a cool, dry place away from extreme temperatures. Do not store it in an unheated garage where water could freeze in the tanks or pump during winter. This can cause severe damage to the internal components. Keeping it in a clean, accessible spot will make your next cleaning task even easier. Regular, simple maintenance extends the life of your appliance. My routine checks keep my cleaner in top shape.

### Troubleshooting Common Turboclean Issues

Even with proper use and maintenance, you might encounter an issue with your Bissell Turboclean carpet cleaner. Knowing how to troubleshoot common problems can save you time and frustration. Most issues are minor and can be resolved easily. I have faced a few snags myself, and here is how I fix them.

One frequent issue is poor suction. If your machine is not picking up dirty water effectively, first check the dirty water tank. Ensure it is not full. An overflowing tank prevents further suction. Also, check that the tank is properly seated and sealed on the machine. A loose tank creates air leaks, which reduce suction power. Make sure the lid is secure too.

Next, inspect the nozzle for clogs. Hair, pet fur, or carpet fibers can easily block the suction path. As mentioned in the maintenance section, remove and rinse the nozzle thoroughly. If your model has a removable hose attachment, check that for blockages as well. A clear path is vital for strong suction. Sometimes, a stubborn clump of pet hair is the culprit.

Another common problem is the machine not spraying solution. Start by checking the clean water tank. Is it filled with enough water and formula? Is it correctly seated? If the tank is fine, the spray nozzle might be clogged. Tiny mineral deposits or dried solution can block the spray jets. Try gently poking a small needle or paperclip into the spray holes to clear them. Always do this carefully to avoid damage.

If the machine simply won't turn on, first check the power cord. Ensure it is fully plugged into a working electrical outlet. Test the outlet with another appliance to confirm it has power. Check for any tripped circuit breakers in your home's electrical panel. If the cord itself looks damaged, do not use the machine. In such cases, replacing the power cord might be necessary, though this typically requires a professional.

If you notice leaks, check all tank seals and connections. Sometimes, a worn-out gasket can cause a drip. Ensure the tanks are not overfilled, as this can also lead to spills. If the leak persists, it might indicate a cracked tank or a more serious internal issue. In these situations, contacting Bissell customer support or a repair service is the best course of action.
