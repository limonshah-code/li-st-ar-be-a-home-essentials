## Make Your Storage Ottoman Look New Again

Has your favorite storage ottoman seen better days? Maybe the fabric is torn, stained, or simply out of style. Instead of buying a new one, you can easily reupholster a storage ottoman yourself. This DIY project breathes new life into a functional piece of furniture. It saves money and allows you to customize the look for your home. I found this process to be very rewarding.

This article guides you through each step of transforming your storage ottoman. We will cover everything from initial preparation to the final touches. Get ready to give your ottoman a stunning, personalized makeover.

### Takeaway:

*   Assess your ottoman for structural integrity before starting.
*   Gather all necessary tools and materials in advance.
*   Carefully disassemble the ottoman, documenting each step.
*   Use old fabric pieces as templates for cutting new fabric.
*   Apply new fabric smoothly, ensuring even tension and neat corners.
*   Reassemble the ottoman, paying attention to its storage function.
*   Finish with trim and hardware for a professional appearance.

To reupholster a storage ottoman, you must first carefully remove the old fabric and padding. Then, measure and cut your new chosen fabric, ensuring it fits perfectly. Finally, meticulously attach the new fabric using a staple gun, reassembling the ottoman's components for a fresh look.

### Preparing for Your Reupholstery Project

Starting any DIY project requires good preparation. This step ensures a smooth process when you reupholster a storage ottoman. You need a clear workspace and the right tools. I always lay down a drop cloth to protect my floors from staples or debris.

Begin by inspecting your storage ottoman. Check the frame for any loose joints or damage. Tighten screws or apply wood glue if necessary. A sturdy base makes the reupholstering process much easier.

#### Essential Tools and Materials

Having all your supplies ready saves time and frustration. You will use various tools for this project. Think about what you already own and what you might need to buy.

Here is a list of common tools and materials:

*   **Staple Gun and Staples:** An electric staple gun is often easier to use than a manual one. Make sure you have plenty of staples.
*   **Fabric Scissors:** Sharp scissors cut upholstery fabric cleanly. Dull scissors can fray edges.
*   **Flathead Screwdriver and Pliers:** These help remove old staples. A staple remover tool is even better.
*   **New Upholstery Fabric:** Choose a durable fabric that matches your decor. Consider the ottoman's use; high-traffic areas need more robust fabric.
*   **Upholstery Foam or Batting:** You might need to replace old padding. High-density foam lasts longer.
*   **Measuring Tape:** Accurate measurements are critical for fabric cutting.
*   **Marker or Chalk:** For marking cuts on your new fabric.
*   **Fabric Glue or Spray Adhesive:** For securing batting or small edges.
*   **Dust Mask and Safety Glasses:** Protect yourself from dust and flying staples.
*   **Webbing or Springs (Optional):** If your ottoman has a very saggy base, you might need these.
*   **Decorative Trim (Optional):** Gimp, cording, or nailhead trim adds a professional finish.

I recommend organizing your tools neatly. This way, you can easily find what you need during the project. A well-organized space contributes to a successful outcome.

### Disassembling Your Storage Ottoman Safely

Disassembly is a crucial first step when you aim to reupholster a storage ottoman. Take your time during this phase. I always recommend taking photos or videos as you go. This visual record helps immensely when you put everything back together.

Start by removing any decorative elements. This includes piping, gimp, or buttons. Use your flathead screwdriver or staple remover to lift old staples. Pry them out carefully to avoid damaging the wood frame.

#### Step-by-Step Disassembly

The goal is to remove the old fabric layer by layer. This also lets you see how the original ottoman was constructed. Understanding the layers makes applying new fabric much simpler.

Follow these steps for safe disassembly:

1.  **Remove Legs/Feet:** If your ottoman has removable legs, unscrew them. Store them in a safe place.
2.  **Separate the Lid from the Base:** Most storage ottomans have a hinged lid. Unscrew the hinges from the base or lid, keeping track of all screws. You might find it easier to work on the lid and base separately.
3.  **Remove Old Fabric from the Base:** Start from the bottom or back of the ottoman. Find the edge of the fabric. Use your staple remover to pry up staples one by one. Pull the fabric away slowly. Be careful not to tear the fabric too much if you plan to use it as a template.
4.  **Remove Old Fabric from the Lid:** Repeat the process for the lid. The lid often has multiple layers of padding and fabric. Pay attention to how corners are folded. This helps later when you reassemble.
5.  **Inspect Padding:** Once the fabric is off, examine the foam and batting. If they are flattened, lumpy, or disintegrated, plan to replace them. This is an important step to ensure comfort and appearance.
6.  **Clean the Frame:** Dust and clean the exposed wood frame. This prepares it for new padding and fabric.

I find that keeping a small container for screws and hardware is very helpful. This prevents lost pieces and makes reassembly smoother. Disassembly can be messy, so keep a vacuum nearby.

The principles are very similar to full reupholstery.

### Choosing the Best Fabric and Padding

Selecting the right fabric transforms your storage ottoman. The fabric choice affects both the look and durability. Think about where your ottoman sits and how often it is used. A busy living room needs a more robust fabric than a guest room.

Consider fabric types like linen, cotton, velvet, or performance fabrics. Performance fabrics resist stains and wear well. Velvet adds a luxurious touch but might show wear more quickly. I prefer durable blends for high-use items.

#### Fabric Quantity and Padding Options

Measuring the correct fabric quantity prevents shortages or excess waste. Lay your old fabric pieces flat. Measure their dimensions, adding extra for seams and wrapping around the frame. Add at least 4-6 inches on each side for wrapping and stapling. When in doubt, buy a little extra fabric.

Padding is equally important for comfort and shape. You might choose to replace the foam and add new batting.

Here are some padding considerations:

*   **High-Density Foam:** This is ideal for the top of the ottoman lid. It provides firm support. Cut it to the exact size of the lid.
*   **Polyester Batting:** Wrap this around the foam to create a softer, more rounded appearance. It helps smooth out any foam edges. You can also use batting to wrap the sides of the ottoman base.
*   **Memory Foam (Optional):** For extra comfort, you can add a layer of memory foam on top of the regular foam.
*   **Cotton Batting:** Offers a flatter, more traditional padding. It compresses over time.

When selecting fabric, think about patterns. Stripes or large patterns require careful alignment. Solid colors or small prints are easier for a first-time reupholsterer. If you're adding details like tufting, you might want to learn about [how to reupholster an ottoman with buttons](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reupholster-an-ottoman-with-buttons) for specific fabric considerations related to button placement.

### Cutting and Attaching Your New Fabric

Accurate cutting and careful attachment are key steps to a professional finish. Use your old fabric pieces as templates for cutting the new fabric. This ensures a perfect fit. Lay the old pieces flat on your new fabric. Trace around them with chalk or a fabric marker. Remember to add your extra allowance for stapling.

Cut slowly and steadily with sharp fabric scissors. Clean cuts prevent fraying and make stapling easier. When dealing with curves, make small relief cuts along the edge. This helps the fabric lay flat without wrinkles.

#### Attaching Fabric to the Ottoman Lid

The lid is often the most visible part of a storage ottoman. Pay close attention here. Start by placing your new foam on the lid, then wrap it with batting. Secure the batting with spray adhesive or a few staples on the underside.

Now, position your new fabric over the padded lid:

1.  **Center the Fabric:** Ensure your chosen pattern is centered if you have one.
2.  **Start Stapling:** Begin by stapling one side of the fabric to the underside of the lid. Pull the fabric taut but not too tight. Place a few staples in the middle of each side.
3.  **Work Towards Corners:** Gradually work your way towards the corners, alternating sides. Pull the fabric firmly to remove wrinkles. Keep the tension even across the surface. This prevents a lumpy look.
4.  **Handle Corners:** For corners, fold the fabric neatly like a gift package. Trim excess fabric if needed. Secure folds with multiple staples. This is where patience pays off for a crisp finish. Some ottomans might feature [piping](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reupholster-a-chair-with-piping) which adds a professional edge to the lid, a detail worth considering for your design.

### Attaching Fabric to the Ottoman Base

Reupholstering the base of a storage ottoman follows similar principles to the lid. You will work around the frame, pulling fabric taut and stapling securely. Remember that the inside of the storage compartment needs to remain clear.

Before stapling the new fabric, apply any new batting to the sides of the ottoman base. Use spray adhesive to hold it in place. This provides a softer feel and smoother surface.

#### Steps for the Ottoman Base

1.  **Position Fabric:** Drape your cut fabric over the ottoman base. Ensure it hangs evenly on all sides. For a plain rectangular ottoman, you might use one large piece of fabric wrapped around, or separate pieces for each side.
2.  **Start Stapling at the Top Edge (if applicable):** If your ottoman has an exposed top edge on the base, start stapling the fabric here. Fold under the raw edge for a clean line before stapling.
3.  **Work Downwards and Around:** Pull the fabric taut and staple it along the bottom edge of the ottoman. Work on opposite sides to maintain even tension. For example, staple the front, then the back, then the sides.
4.  **Address Corners:** As with the lid, carefully fold the fabric at the corners. Create neat pleats or tucks. Secure these folds with strong staples. Trim any excess fabric that might bulk up the corners.
5.  **Inside Edges for Storage:** For the inner part of the storage compartment, you might fold the fabric under and staple it to the inside of the frame. This gives a clean finish to the storage area itself. Alternatively, you can use a separate piece of fabric to line the inside, if desired. This attention to detail ensures the storage function remains fully accessible and visually appealing.

Throughout this process, step back regularly to check your work. Look for wrinkles or uneven tension. It is easier to fix small issues as you go than to correct large mistakes at the end.

### Reassembling and Finishing Touches

After attaching all the new fabric, your storage ottoman is almost complete. Now, you need to reassemble its components. This brings your refreshed ottoman to life. I find this stage very satisfying, seeing the transformation.

Start by reattaching the lid to the base. Carefully align the hinges with their original screw holes. Use the screws you saved during disassembly. Ensure the lid opens and closes smoothly.

#### Adding Decorative Elements

Finishing touches elevate your reupholstered storage ottoman from a DIY project to a professional-looking piece. This is where you add personality.

Consider these options:

*   **Gimp or Cording:** This decorative trim hides staples and raw edges. Apply it with fabric glue. Start in an inconspicuous spot. Press it firmly into place.
*   **Nailhead Trim:** Individual nailheads or a continuous strip can add a classic or modern touch. Use a rubber mallet to tap them in. Ensure they are evenly spaced.
*   **Decorative Legs:** If you removed the original legs, screw them back on. You could also replace old legs with new, stylish ones. This provides a completely different look.
*   **Buttons (Tufting):** If your design includes tufting, this is the time to add it. This involves pulling fabric through the foam and securing it with buttons. This creates a classic, dimpled look.

Clean any glue residue or fabric scraps. Your storage ottoman is now ready for use. It will look like a brand new piece of furniture. You might feel a great sense of accomplishment.

### Troubleshooting Common Reupholstery Issues

Even experienced DIYers encounter challenges. When you reupholster a storage ottoman, you might face common issues. Do not get discouraged. Most problems have simple solutions. I learned to anticipate these and tackle them head-on.

#### Addressing Fabric Problems

*   **Wrinkles or Bumps:** This usually happens from uneven tension. Gently pull back the fabric in the affected area. Restaple it, pulling more firmly and evenly. Use a hair dryer on a low setting to help relax certain fabrics before pulling.
*   **Sagging Fabric:** If the fabric looks loose, it means it was not pulled taut enough. Remove staples in the sagging area. Pull the fabric tighter. Restaple it every inch or so to ensure it holds.
*   **Corners Not Neat:** Tricky corners are a common issue. If your corner folds look bulky, remove some staples. Re-fold the fabric, trimming excess material from the underside. Create crisp pleats. You can use fabric glue to hold the folds temporarily before stapling.
*   **Staples Not Holding:** This happens if your staple gun is not powerful enough or staples are too short. Ensure you use heavy-duty staples suitable for upholstery. Press the staple gun firmly against the frame.

#### Dealing with Structural Issues

*   **Wobbly Frame:** If you find the frame wobbles after reassembly, check all joints. Apply wood glue to loose joints. Clamp them until dry. Then re-staple the fabric.
*   **Lid Not Closing Properly:** Ensure the hinges are aligned correctly. Adjust their position slightly if needed. Sometimes, the new fabric thickness can affect the closure. You might need to adjust the hinge placement or trim a tiny bit of fabric near the hinge line.

Remember, practice makes perfect. Your first reupholstery project might have imperfections. Each attempt builds skill. Your refreshed storage ottoman will still be a testament to your hard work. Consider this a journey of learning.

### Maintaining Your Newly Upholstered Ottoman

You have invested time and effort to reupholster a storage ottoman. Now, proper care ensures its longevity. Regular maintenance keeps your ottoman looking fresh and extends its life. I always advise thinking about care requirements when choosing fabric.

The best way to care for your ottoman depends on the fabric type. Different fabrics have different cleaning needs. Knowing your fabric's composition is key.

#### Cleaning and Care Tips

*   **Regular Vacuuming:** Use a soft brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner. Gently vacuum the entire surface. This removes dust, pet hair, and crumbs. Do this at least once a week. Regular vacuuming prevents dirt from embedding into the fibers.
*   **Spot Cleaning:** For spills, act quickly. Blot liquid spills with a clean, dry cloth. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. For tougher stains, use a fabric cleaner specifically designed for your fabric type. Test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area first. This prevents discoloration.
*   **Protect from Sunlight:** Direct sunlight can fade fabric over time. Position your ottoman away from direct sun exposure. Use curtains or blinds to protect it.
*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Do not use bleach or harsh chemical cleaners. These can damage fabric fibers or cause discoloration. Stick to mild, pH-neutral cleaners.
*   **Rotate Cushions (if applicable):** If your ottoman has removable cushions, flip and rotate them regularly. This helps distribute wear evenly. It maintains the shape and extends the life of the padding.
*   **Pet Care:** If you have pets, consider using a furniture cover. Regularly brush pet hair from the fabric. Keep pet nails trimmed to prevent snags.

By following these simple maintenance tips, your reupholstered storage ottoman will remain a beautiful and functional piece in your home for years. It will continue to serve as a practical storage solution and a stylish accent.
