Every adjustable bed operates using a motor system. These motors move different sections of the bed frame. The remote control sends signals to the motor, telling it to adjust. When you need to manually lower an adjustable bed, you bypass this electrical system. You are looking for a way to mechanically release the bed.

Many modern adjustable beds include specific features for emergencies. These often involve a battery backup system. They also may have manual release pins or levers. These components allow you to return the bed to a flat position. Familiarize yourself with your bed's manual. It contains specific instructions for your model. If your remote is unresponsive, learning [how to reset adjustable bed without remote](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-adjustable-bed-without-remote) can sometimes fix the issue. If the remote itself is the problem, knowing [how to unlock remote for adjustable bed](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-unlock-remote-for-adjustable-bed) might be helpful.

## Essential Safety Precautions Before You Begin

Safety is paramount when attempting to manually lower your adjustable bed. Rushing or ignoring safety steps can lead to injury. It can also cause further damage to your bed. Take a moment to assess the situation. Prepare your workspace before you start.

### Power Disconnection and Clearance

The first and most critical step is to disconnect the bed from its power source. This means unplugging the power cord from the wall outlet. Do not just turn off the switch at the wall. You must remove the plug completely. This prevents accidental activation of the motor. It also protects you from electrical shock.

Next, ensure the area around your bed is clear. Remove any obstacles that might be in the way. Check for pets or children who might get too close. Make sure you have enough space to move around the bed. You need clear access to the bed's underside and mechanisms. This step prevents trips or falls.

### Seeking Assistance When Needed

Adjustable beds are heavy, even without a mattress. Attempting to lift or manipulate parts alone can be risky. If you feel unsure or find the task too difficult, ask for help. A second person can provide support and ensure safety. They can help lift or stabilize parts as needed.

Never force any part of the bed. If something resists movement, stop and re-evaluate. Applying too much force can bend components or damage the motor. This can lead to costly repairs. Patience and a careful approach are essential for success. Your bed's integrity depends on it.

Some adjustable bed models have a battery backup system. This system provides a temporary power supply. It lets you lower the bed even without main electricity. These backups often use 9-volt batteries. They are typically located near the bed's motor or control box.

First, locate the battery pack. It often attaches to the bed frame or motor housing. You might need to open a small cover. Check the batteries inside. Replace them if they are dead or corroded. Once fresh batteries are in, you should hear a small click or see a light. This indicates the backup power is active. Use your remote control to lower the bed. The backup power only provides enough energy for a few cycles. It will let you return the bed to a flat position.

### Locating and Activating Manual Release Pins

Not all beds have battery backups, or the backup might fail. Many beds have manual release pins or levers. These pins are usually near the pivot points of the bed frame. They allow you to disengage the motor's hold on the frame. This releases the tension, allowing you to manually push the bed down.

Inspect the underside of your bed. Look for small pins, levers, or handles near the moving joints. Your owner's manual will show their exact location. Once you find them, you may need to pull, push, or twist them. This action typically disengages the locking mechanism. With the pins released, gently push the bed down. Do this evenly from both sides. Be careful not to pinch your fingers. If you are trying to understand the overall structure of your bed frame, learning [how to disassemble a mattress firm adjustable base](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-disassemble-a-mattress-firm-adjustable-base) might give you a better idea of its components.

### Direct Motor Manipulation (Caution)

This method requires extreme caution. Only attempt it if other options fail. Some bed motors have a manual override function. This might be a small knob or a release button on the motor itself. This function allows you to manually turn the motor shaft. Turning the shaft will slowly lower the bed.

Identify the motor units under your bed. Look for a hexagonal shaft or a specific release mechanism. You might need a tool, like an Allen wrench or a small lever. Turn the shaft slowly and steadily. Do not force it. If there is no specific manual override on the motor, do not try to pry or force it. You risk severe damage to the motor. Always prioritize the methods recommended in your bed's manual first.

## Brand-Specific Manual Lowering Techniques

Every adjustable bed manufacturer designs their products differently. This means that manual lowering procedures can vary significantly. What works for one brand might not apply to another. It is important to know your specific bed's make and model. This knowledge helps you find the right instructions.

### Sleep Number Beds

Sleep Number adjustable bases, like the FlexFit series, have specific emergency procedures. These beds often use a remote control that communicates with a control box. If the remote or power fails, you typically need to locate the control box. This box is usually under the bed, near the head or foot.

Some Sleep Number bases might have a button on the control box itself. Pressing this button can override the remote and flatten the bed. Other models might have a battery backup port. You can connect a 9-volt battery to this port to provide temporary power. Always refer to your Sleep Number owner's manual for precise steps. They detail the exact location of the control box and any emergency lower buttons or battery ports. For specific guidance, you can refer to resources on [how to manually lower Sleep Number bed](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-manually-lower-sleep-number-bed).
