*   **Lower Video Quality:** If possible, slightly reduce the video quality settings. While high quality is nice, a slightly lower resolution saves battery power. The doorbell still captures clear images.
*   **Schedule Away/Home Routines:** Use the "Home" and "Away" routines in the Google Home app. When you are home, you might not need as many notifications. This can reduce unnecessary activity.
*   **Charge Before Draining Completely:** Try to recharge the battery before it completely dies. Letting it drain to zero repeatedly can shorten its lifespan over time. Aim to recharge when it reaches 20% or 10%.
*   **Consider Wired Installation:** If you have existing doorbell wires, connect your Nest Doorbell to them. This provides continuous charging. It effectively turns your battery doorbell into a wired one. This eliminates the need for manual recharging. This is a good option if frequent charging is a bother. It gives you true set-and-forget convenience.
