### Quick Answer: How to Use Your LG Dryer Rack

To use your LG dryer rack, place it securely inside the dryer drum. Position it on the front and rear dryer drum lips. Then, lay the items flat on the rack. Select the appropriate "Rack Dry" or "Timed Dry" cycle on your LG dryer. This dries items gently without tumbling.

## Understanding the LG Dryer Rack and Its Purpose

The LG dryer rack is a specialized accessory for your laundry machine. It fits inside the dryer drum. This rack creates a stable, flat surface. It holds items still while the dryer circulates warm air. This design protects delicate fabrics and bulky items. Standard tumble drying can damage these items.

Many people wonder if their LG dryer includes this rack. Some LG dryer models come with a rack as a standard accessory. Others offer it as an optional purchase. You can check your dryer's manual or the manufacturer's website. Knowing if your model includes one helps you plan your laundry needs. You can learn more about this by reading our article: [Does LG dryer come with drying rack](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-lg-dryer-come-with-drying-rack).

The primary purpose of the dryer rack is to offer gentle drying. It stops items from tumbling, which can cause shrinking, stretching, or snagging. This is especially good for items that must keep their shape. Think about sweaters or certain athletic gear. The rack provides a safe drying environment. It keeps your clothes looking better for longer.

## Installing Your LG Dryer Rack: A Simple Guide

Putting your LG dryer rack in place is a straightforward process. You do not need special tools or complex steps. First, open your dryer door wide. Locate the two small indentations or lips inside the dryer drum. One lip is at the front opening, and the other is at the back of the drum. These lips support the rack.

Pick up your LG dryer rack. You will see it has a front edge and a back edge designed to rest on these lips. Carefully slide the rack into the dryer. Position the back edge first, resting it on the rear lip. Then, lower the front edge. It should rest on the front lip of the dryer opening. The rack needs to sit flat and secure. It must not wobble. A wobbly rack means it is not installed correctly.

Once installed, give the rack a gentle push to confirm it is stable. It should feel firm. If it moves, adjust it until it sits snugly. Proper installation ensures your items stay put during the drying cycle. It also prevents any damage to your dryer or the rack itself.

This simple setup prepares your dryer for specialized care.

## Preparing Items for Rack Drying

Proper preparation ensures effective and safe drying on your LG dryer rack. Begin by making sure your items are clean. Remove any loose dirt or debris. This stops these materials from transferring to the dryer or other clothes.

Next, wring out excess water from the item. The dryer rack dries items without tumbling. This means very wet items take a long time to dry. Too much water can also drip into the dryer drum. Gently squeeze the item or roll it in a towel to remove most of the water. Avoid twisting delicate fabrics too hard. This can damage them.

Now, place the item flat on the rack. Spread it out evenly. Do not let parts hang over the edges. Hanging parts might get caught in the drum movement. Make sure the item does not touch the dryer drum walls. Even contact with the rack surface helps the air circulate around the item. This promotes even drying. For larger items, you might need to fold them once. Ensure the fold is loose. This allows air to reach all parts. Proper placement is key to good drying results.

## Drying Specific Items with Your LG Dryer Rack

The LG dryer rack is perfect for items that need special care. Knowing what to dry on the rack protects your belongings. It extends their life.

*   **Delicate Garments:** Items like lingerie, silk blouses, or lace. These fabrics are fragile. Tumbling can snag, stretch, or tear them. Laying them flat on the rack provides gentle drying. It maintains their shape.

*   **Sweaters and Knitwear:** Wool, cashmere, and other knit items can shrink or lose shape in a tumbling dryer. The rack supports the garment's structure. It allows air to dry it without stress. This keeps your sweaters looking new.

*   **Athletic Shoes:** You can dry sneakers, running shoes, or cleats on the rack. Place them on their sides or soles. This prevents them from banging around the dryer drum. Tumbling shoes create loud noise and can damage the dryer or the shoes. The rack secures them. It dries them quickly.

*   **Stuffed Animals and Toys:** Many plush toys cannot tumble. Their stuffing can shift. Delicate parts can break. The rack provides a gentle drying spot. It keeps toys intact.

*   **Hats and Caps:** Baseball caps or other structured hats can lose shape in a regular dryer. Place them on the rack to maintain their form. The heat dries them without crushing them.

*   **Embellished Items:** Clothes with beads, sequins, or delicate embroidery. Tumbling can cause these embellishments to fall off or get damaged. Rack drying protects them.

Always check care labels before drying any item. Some items may still require air drying. If a care label says "Do Not Tumble Dry," the rack is a safe option. It provides controlled, non-tumble drying.

## Selecting the Right Dryer Cycle for Rack Drying

Choosing the correct dryer cycle is important for successful rack drying. Your LG dryer offers several options. These ensure proper care for your items.

Most LG dryers have a specific "Rack Dry" cycle. If your model has this, it is the best choice. This cycle is pre-programmed for rack drying. It uses low heat and a fixed time. The drum does not tumble during this cycle. This protects items from movement. This mode optimizes airflow for flat drying.

If your LG dryer does not have a "Rack Dry" cycle, select "Timed Dry." You will need to manually set the time and temperature.
*   **Temperature:** Always choose a low or medium heat setting. High heat can damage delicate fabrics or melt shoe adhesives. Low heat prevents shrinking. It also stops fabric damage.
*   **Time:** Start with a shorter time, like 30-60 minutes. Check the item's dryness periodically. You can add more time if needed. Over-drying can still harm items. It also wastes energy.

For items like shoes, you might use a slightly higher heat if they are not delicate. Always confirm the material can handle the heat. Always refer to your LG dryer's user manual for cycle recommendations. Every model has unique features. The manual provides the most accurate guide for your specific appliance.

## Troubleshooting Common Rack Drying Issues

Sometimes, you might encounter small problems when using your LG dryer rack. Knowing how to fix them helps. It ensures your laundry day stays smooth.

*   **Items Not Drying Evenly:** This often happens if items are too thick or folded poorly. Make sure to spread items out as much as possible. If an item is very large, you might need to flip it halfway through the cycle. This allows air to reach both sides. For thick items, use a longer drying time at a lower heat. Do not overload the rack. This stops air circulation.

*   **Excessive Drying Time:** If your items take too long to dry, first check if they were too wet when placed on the rack. Wring out excess water before placing items. Next, check your dryer vents. A clogged vent restricts airflow. This makes drying take longer. Regularly clean your lint filter. Also, ensure the external vent pipe is clear. For general dryer cleaning, you can read our article: [How to clean LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer).

*   **Rack Movement or Noise:** The rack should sit securely. If it moves or makes noise, it is not installed correctly. Re-seat the rack. Make sure both front and back edges rest firmly on the dryer drum lips. Check for any obstructions. Ensure the items on the rack are not causing imbalance.

*   **Items Still Damp:** After the cycle, if items are still damp, they might need more time. Check the item. If only small spots are damp, consider air-drying the rest. If the whole item is damp, run another short "Timed Dry" cycle. Increase the time slightly. Remember, very delicate items might not get fully bone dry on a low heat setting. A little dampness is fine if you plan to air-dry the rest.

*   **Damage to Items:** If items are damaged, check the heat setting. It might be too high. Also, make sure items are not pressing against the hot dryer drum walls. Ensure the rack is stable. It should not shift and pinch fabric. Always check care labels before drying.

Addressing these issues helps you get the best results from your LG dryer rack. It makes your specialty laundry care simple and effective.

## Care and Maintenance of Your LG Dryer Rack

Proper care keeps your LG dryer rack in good condition. It extends its lifespan. This also ensures it works well every time you use it.

*   **Regular Cleaning:** The dryer rack can collect lint and dust over time. After each use, wipe down the rack with a damp cloth. You can use a mild soap solution for a deeper clean if needed. Rinse the rack well. Ensure it is dry before storing or reusing. This prevents residue buildup. It keeps your rack hygienic.

*   **Inspect for Damage:** Before and after each use, quickly inspect the rack. Look for any cracks, bends, or loose parts. The rack is usually made of durable plastic or metal. However, wear and tear can occur. If you notice damage, replace the rack. A damaged rack might not hold items securely. It could even scratch the dryer drum.

*   **Proper Storage:** When not in use, store the dryer rack in a safe place. Many LG dryers have space inside the drum for rack storage. Check your dryer manual for specific storage suggestions. If not stored inside, keep it in a closet or utility room. Store it flat or against a wall. This prevents it from bending or breaking. Do not place heavy items on top of it.

*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Do not use abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals on the rack. These can damage its surface. They might also leave residues that transfer to your clothes. Stick to mild soap and water for cleaning.

*   **Handle with Care:** The rack is strong but not indestructible. Avoid dropping it or forcing it into the dryer. Gentle handling during installation and removal helps prevent damage.

Following these simple care steps ensures your LG dryer rack remains a valuable tool. It continues to help you care for your special laundry items for years. Regular maintenance of the dryer itself, like cleaning the lint trap and vents, also supports the rack's function by ensuring efficient drying.
