## How To Test Your Leaf Blower's Ignition Coil With a Multimeter for Easy Fixes

Your leaf blower sits ready for action. You pull the cord, but nothing happens. The engine refuses to start. Often, a "no spark" condition is the culprit, and a faulty ignition coil causes this. I understand how frustrating this can be. You just want to get your yard work done.

Learning **how to test an ignition coil on a leaf blower with a multimeter** saves you time and money. You do not need to take your blower to a repair shop. This guide gives you clear steps to diagnose the problem yourself. I will walk you through the process, from understanding the ignition system to interpreting your multimeter readings. You will gain confidence in handling small engine repairs. Let's get your leaf blower roaring again.

### Takeaway

*   Gather essential tools, including a multimeter set to ohms.
*   Always disconnect the spark plug wire before starting work.
*   Access the ignition coil by removing the blower's housing.
*   Perform primary and secondary resistance tests on the coil.
*   Compare your readings to the manufacturer's specifications.
*   Replace the ignition coil if it falls outside the specified range.
*   Set the correct air gap between the coil and flywheel during reassembly.

To test an ignition coil on a leaf blower with a multimeter, set the multimeter to the ohms (立) range. Test the primary winding resistance by connecting leads to the kill switch terminal and the coil's ground. Test the secondary winding resistance by connecting leads to the spark plug boot and the ground. Compare readings to specifications to check for faults.

### Understanding Your Leaf Blower's Ignition System

Every time you pull the starter rope on your leaf blower, a complex process begins. The ignition system creates the spark that ignites the fuel-air mixture. This process makes the engine run. The ignition coil plays a central role in this system. It acts like a small transformer, boosting low voltage from the flywheel to a very high voltage for the spark plug.

The system includes a few main parts. A magnet is on the engine's flywheel. This flywheel spins when you pull the rope. As the magnet passes the ignition coil, it creates a small electrical current. The coil then transforms this current into a high-voltage pulse. This pulse travels through the spark plug wire to the spark plug. The spark plug then creates a spark. This spark lights the fuel.

A bad ignition coil causes several problems. Your leaf blower may not start at all. It might start but then quickly die. You might notice your leaf blower dies quickly when you give it gas. Sometimes, it runs poorly or loses power. These symptoms often point to an issue with the ignition system. Checking the coil is a crucial diagnostic step.

Symptoms of a bad ignition coil often look like fuel issues. Your blower might run rough. It could misfire. It might lack power or acceleration. Sometimes, the engine starts fine when cold but dies when hot. This can indicate a coil failing under heat. If you suspect an ignition issue, the coil is a good place to start. A proper test helps confirm the problem.

### Essential Tools and Safety Before You Begin

Before you start any repair work, safety comes first. Working with small engines involves moving parts and electrical components. You need to take precautions. The most important step is to disconnect the spark plug wire. This prevents the engine from accidentally starting. You should wear work gloves to protect your hands. Safety glasses shield your eyes from debris.

You need a few basic tools for this job. A screwdriver set helps remove the blower housing screws. You might need a Torx or Allen wrench set depending on your leaf blower model. A spark plug wrench removes the spark plug. A feeler gauge is useful for setting the air gap later. The most critical tool for testing is a multimeter.

A multimeter measures electrical properties. You will use it to check resistance. Multimeters come in digital and analog versions. A digital multimeter is usually easier to read. Set your multimeter to the ohms (立) range. This setting measures electrical resistance. You will test the primary and secondary windings of the ignition coil.

Make sure your multimeter has fresh batteries. Low batteries can give incorrect readings. Understand how to use your specific multimeter model. Read its manual if you are unsure. Knowing your tools makes the job easier and safer. Taking these safety steps and gathering your tools sets you up for success.

### Disassembling Your Leaf Blower to Access the Ignition Coil

Accessing the ignition coil requires some disassembly of your leaf blower. Do not worry; this process is straightforward. First, place your leaf blower on a clean, stable surface. A workbench is ideal. Ensure you have good lighting. You will need to remove the outer casing.

The housing often consists of several plastic panels. Look for screws that hold these panels in place. They are usually visible on the outside. Use the appropriate screwdriver or wrench to remove them. Keep track of the screws. You can put them in a small container or cup. This prevents them from getting lost. Some screws might be longer than others. Note their original positions.

Once you remove the outer panels, you can see the engine. The ignition coil is typically located near the flywheel. The flywheel is the large, finned wheel at the front or side of the engine. It has magnets embedded in it. The coil sits very close to the flywheel, sometimes mounted on top of the engine block. It has a thick wire coming out of it that goes to the spark plug. This is the spark plug wire.

Before you touch the coil, inspect its connections. The spark plug wire connects one end of the coil. A small kill switch wire usually connects to the other end. This wire grounds the coil to stop the engine. You may also see a small metal leg or bracket that touches the engine block. This provides a ground connection for the coil itself. You may notice your leaf blower runs slow or [loses power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-leaf-blower-not-running-at-full-speed) if electrical components like the coil are not properly accessed or connected. Gently disconnect the kill switch wire from the coil. Also, unplug the spark plug boot from the spark plug if you have not already. Take a moment to understand how these parts connect. This helps you reassemble them correctly later.

### Performing the Primary Coil Resistance Test

Now you have access to the ignition coil. The first test involves the primary winding. This winding has fewer turns of thicker wire inside the coil. It handles the initial low voltage from the flywheel. You will measure its electrical resistance. This tells you if the winding is open or shorted.

Set your multimeter to the lowest ohms (立) range. This is usually "200" or "2k" (2000) ohms. The primary winding has very low resistance. So, a low range setting gives you the most accurate reading. If your multimeter has an auto-ranging feature, it will select the correct range for you.

Locate the terminals for the primary winding. One lead from your multimeter goes to the kill switch terminal on the coil. This is the small metal tab or wire connection point. The other multimeter lead goes to the coil's ground. You can often touch it to a clean metal part of the coil's mounting bracket or the engine block itself if the coil is mounted. Make sure you have a good, clean metal-to-metal contact for an accurate reading.

The primary resistance reading should be very low. It usually falls between 0.3 ohms and 1.5 ohms. This value varies by manufacturer. Check your leaf blower's service manual for the exact specification. If you get a reading of "OL" (over limit) or "1." (open circuit), it means the primary winding is open. This indicates a bad coil. If the reading is much lower than specified, like 0.1 ohms, it could mean a short circuit. This also points to a faulty coil. A correct reading suggests the primary winding is likely good. Remember, a leaf blower that [only runs with the choke on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-leaf-blower-only-run-with-the-choke-on) can sometimes be a symptom of a weak spark, which a bad coil can cause. So, this test is important.

### Conducting the Secondary Coil Resistance Test

After testing the primary winding, you need to test the secondary winding. This winding has many turns of very fine wire. It boosts the voltage to thousands of volts for the spark plug. This test also measures resistance but at a much higher value. This helps confirm the coil's overall health.

Keep your multimeter set to ohms (立), but you will need a higher range now. Set it to "20k" (20,000) ohms or "200k" (200,000) ohms. The secondary winding has much higher resistance due to its many wire turns. An auto-ranging multimeter will adjust itself.

Connect one multimeter lead to the metal tip inside the spark plug boot. This is the part that connects to the spark plug. Make sure the boot is clean. The other multimeter lead goes to a good ground point. You can touch it to a clean metal part of the engine block or the coil's mounting bracket. Ensure a solid connection for accurate results.

The secondary resistance reading will be much higher than the primary. It typically ranges from 2,000 ohms (2k立) to 15,000 ohms (15k立). Again, consult your leaf blower's service manual for the precise specification. If your reading is "OL" or "1.", it means the secondary winding is open. This is a common failure point. A reading significantly lower than specified could indicate a short circuit within the secondary winding. Either an open or a shorted secondary winding means the coil is bad.

If both primary and secondary tests yield readings within the manufacturer's specifications, your ignition coil is likely good. If either test fails, you need to replace the ignition coil.

### Checking for Short Circuits and Grounding Issues

Beyond measuring resistance, you also need to check for unwanted electrical paths. A short circuit can prevent the coil from producing a strong spark. This happens if the winding insulation breaks down. The electricity then travels an unintended path. It does not reach the spark plug effectively. This means your coil fails to deliver high voltage.

Set your multimeter to the continuity setting. This setting often beeps when it detects a continuous circuit. If your multimeter does not have a continuity setting, use a very high ohms range, like 2M立 (2,000,000 ohms). An open circuit will show "OL" or "1.".

Touch one multimeter lead to the metal tip inside the spark plug boot. Touch the other lead to the metal core of the coil. This is the laminations or mounting bracket. You should not get any continuity reading or a very high resistance. If your multimeter beeps or shows a very low resistance, it means the secondary winding is shorted to ground. This makes the coil unusable.

Proper grounding is vital for an ignition coil. The coil needs a good connection to the engine block for the circuit to complete. Inspect the coil's mounting bolts and brackets. Ensure they are clean and free of rust or paint. These elements can act as insulators, preventing proper grounding. You can also test the continuity between the coil's mounting points and a known good ground point on the engine block. It should show continuity. If it does not, clean the mounting surfaces.

Also, examine the kill switch wire. This wire goes from the coil to the kill switch. When you turn off the engine, this wire grounds the coil to stop the spark. If this wire is frayed or pinched, it could accidentally short to ground. This would prevent the engine from starting or cause it to die unexpectedly. Ensure the wire is intact and properly insulated. Sometimes, even [cleaning the ignition coil](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-ignition-coil) can resolve minor issues if dirt or corrosion affects contacts. However, if the internal windings are faulty, only replacement helps.

### Verifying Spark Plug and Gap (Related Checks)

Even if your ignition coil tests perfectly, your leaf blower might still not start. This is why you need to check other parts of the ignition system. The spark plug is a common culprit for "no spark" issues. A dirty, fouled, or damaged spark plug prevents proper ignition. It can mimic a bad coil's symptoms. Always check the spark plug before replacing the coil.

First, remove the spark plug. Use your spark plug wrench for this. Inspect its condition. Look for signs of fouling. A black, sooty appearance indicates a rich fuel mixture or excess oil. A white or light gray appearance suggests a lean mixture or overheating. Oil deposits can also cover the electrodes. Any of these conditions prevent a strong spark. If the electrodes are worn, bent, or chipped, the plug needs replacement.

Next, check the spark plug gap. The gap is the distance between the center electrode and the ground electrode. This distance is critical for a strong spark. Use a feeler gauge to measure the gap. Compare this measurement to your leaf blower's service manual. The correct gap is usually very small, often between 0.020 and 0.030 inches. If the gap is too wide, the coil struggles to jump the gap. If it is too narrow, the spark may be weak or inconsistent. Adjust the gap if needed by gently bending the ground electrode.

A good spark plug is essential. Even a strong coil cannot produce a good spark through a bad plug. A damaged spark plug boot or wire can also cause issues. Inspect the spark plug wire for cracks or damage. Ensure the boot fits tightly onto the spark plug. Any damage here can cause the spark to leak out before reaching the plug. Addressing these small items can often resolve starting problems quickly.

### FAQ Section

**Q1: What are common signs of a bad ignition coil on a leaf blower?**
A bad ignition coil causes a few distinct issues. Your leaf blower may not start at all. It might start but then die quickly. The engine could misfire or run very rough. It might also lose power, especially under load. Sometimes, a coil fails only when it gets hot, causing the engine to die after running for a short period.

**Q2: Can I test an ignition coil without a multimeter?**
You cannot accurately test an ignition coil's internal resistance without a multimeter. You can perform a spark test. This involves removing the spark plug, connecting it to the wire, grounding the plug, and pulling the starter cord. A visible spark indicates the coil is working. However, this test does not confirm the coil's strength or if it is about to fail.

**Q3: What are normal resistance readings for a leaf blower ignition coil?**
Normal primary coil resistance is very low, usually between 0.3 to 1.5 ohms. Normal secondary coil resistance is much higher, typically ranging from 2,000 ohms (2k立) to 15,000 ohms (15k立). These values vary by manufacturer and model. Always consult your specific leaf blower's service manual for precise specifications.

**Q4: Should I replace my ignition coil or clean it?**
You should replace your ignition coil if it fails the resistance tests. If the internal windings are faulty, cleaning will not fix the problem. You can clean the coil's external surfaces and terminals if they are dirty or corroded. Sometimes, a poor connection caused by dirt can mimic a bad coil. If cleaning restores function, that is great, but a failed test means replacement.
