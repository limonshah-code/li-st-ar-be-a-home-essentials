Understanding your refrigerator's dimensions and capacity is important for various reasons. Perhaps you are planning a kitchen renovation. Maybe you are replacing an old appliance. You might just want to know its storage capacity.

This article will help you uncover the true size of your Kenmore refrigerator, focusing on models starting with "106." We will explain how Kenmore model numbers work. You will learn where to find your refrigerator's full model number. We will also show you how to use this number to determine its cubic feet and external dimensions. Get ready to find the precise details about your Kenmore refrigerator.

### Takeaway

To find the precise size of your Kenmore refrigerator, especially those with "106" in the model number, remember these key points:

*   The "106" prefix indicates the manufacturer, not the specific size.
*   You must find the *full* model number to get accurate dimensions.
*   Locate the model number sticker inside your refrigerator or on the back.
*   Use the full model number to look up exact specifications online.
*   Measure your physical refrigerator for precise external dimensions, accounting for door swing.

### The Clear Answer to Kenmore Refrigerator Model 106 Size

A Kenmore refrigerator with "106" in its model number does not have a single, universal size. The "106" prefix identifies the manufacturer (typically Whirlpool for these models), not the appliance's specific dimensions or cubic footage. To find the exact size of your Kenmore refrigerator, you need the *complete* model number, which will specify the unique dimensions and capacity.

## Understanding Kenmore Refrigerator Model Numbers

Many people own a Kenmore refrigerator. Kenmore is a trusted brand name for home appliances. Sears has sold Kenmore appliances for decades. These appliances are not made by Kenmore themselves. Instead, other major manufacturers produce them. These manufacturers include Whirlpool, LG, Frigidaire, and others. The "106" prefix in a Kenmore refrigerator model number generally indicates that Whirlpool manufactured that specific unit. This means your refrigerator shares design elements and parts with actual Whirlpool models.

Knowing the manufacturer is helpful for parts and service. However, the "106" itself does not tell you the size. It is only the first part of a much longer model number. A full Kenmore model number typically looks like `106.XXXXXXX` or `106.XXXXXXXXXX`. The digits after the "106" and the decimal point are crucial. They identify the specific model, its features, and its dimensions. Without the complete model number, it is impossible to determine the exact cubic feet or external measurements of your refrigerator.

Every digit in the full model number helps categorize the appliance. Some digits might tell you the color. Others indicate specific features like ice makers or water dispensers. Most importantly, specific digits or the entire sequence identify the refrigerator's capacity and physical size. This system helps Kenmore manage a vast range of products. It also helps consumers and technicians identify individual units precisely.

## Where to Find Your Full Kenmore Model Number

Finding the full model number for your Kenmore refrigerator is the first step. You need this number to determine the size. The model number is usually on a sticker or data plate. This plate also lists other important information. This information includes the serial number and manufacturing date. Appliance manufacturers place this sticker in standard locations.

Look for the sticker in these common places inside your refrigerator:

*   **Inside the Fresh Food Compartment:** This is the most common spot. Check along the top, side walls, or on the ceiling of the refrigerator section. It might be near the crisper drawers or on the side wall behind one of the shelves.
*   **Behind the Kick Plate:** Sometimes, the sticker is located behind the lower front kick plate. This is the removable panel at the very bottom front of the refrigerator. You might need to gently pull or unsnap it to see the label.
*   **On the Back of the Unit:** In some older models, or if you cannot find it inside, the sticker might be on the very back of the refrigerator. This location is less convenient. You might need to pull the refrigerator away from the wall to see it.
*   **Inside the Freezer Compartment:** For some models, especially those with top or bottom freezers, the label can be inside the freezer section. Check the walls or ceiling there.

Once you find the sticker, write down the *entire* model number. It is crucial to get every digit and punctuation mark correct. Even a small error can lead to wrong information. The model number often appears in bold text. It might be labeled "Model No." or "Mod." The serial number is usually nearby. Knowing [how to tell which Kenmore refrigerator you have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-which-kenmore-refrigerator-i-have) is essential for accurate identification and looking up specifications. This complete number is your key to unlocking all the details about your Kenmore refrigerator's size.

## Deciphering Kenmore Model Numbers for Size Information

Once you have your complete Kenmore refrigerator model number, you can find its size. The model number itself often does not directly state the cubic feet or external dimensions. Instead, it acts as a unique identifier. You use this identifier to look up the exact specifications. Manufacturers maintain extensive databases for all their models.

Here is how you can decipher the size information:

1.  **Online Search:** The easiest way is to enter your full Kenmore model number into a search engine. Include "Kenmore" and "refrigerator" in your search query. For example, search for "Kenmore refrigerator 106.xxxxxxx specifications."
2.  **Manufacturer's Website:** Visit the Kenmore section of the Sears PartsDirect website. You can often find product manuals and specification sheets there. These documents list detailed dimensions and cubic capacity.
3.  **Appliance Retailer Databases:** Many large appliance retailers (like Lowe's, Home Depot, or Best Buy if they carried Kenmore) have online product databases. You might find archived product pages for your specific model. These pages list all the relevant size information.
4.  **Original Manual:** If you still have the owner's manual that came with your refrigerator, it will contain all the specifications. This is the most reliable source of information.

The size information you find will typically include:

*   **Cubic Feet (cu. ft.):** This measures the internal storage capacity of the refrigerator. It tells you how much food and drink the unit can hold. Common sizes range from small 10-15 cu. ft. models to large 25-30+ cu. ft. units.
*   **Height (H):** This is the measurement from the floor to the top of the refrigerator. It is important for fitting under cabinets.
*   **Width (W):** This is the side-to-side measurement. It is critical for fitting into existing cabinet openings.
*   **Depth (D):** This is the front-to-back measurement. It includes the door, but not necessarily the handles. There are two common depths:
    *   **Standard-Depth:** These are deeper units, usually sticking out past standard kitchen counters.
    *   **Counter-Depth:** These are designed to align more closely with the depth of standard kitchen countertops.

Knowing [how to tell the cubic feet of a Kenmore refrigerator by model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-cubic-feet-of-kenmore-refrigerator-by-model-number) is a direct path to understanding its internal volume. Always cross-reference information from a couple of sources if possible. This helps ensure accuracy.

## Common Refrigerator Sizes and Kenmore 106 Series Variety

Kenmore refrigerators, including those in the "106" series, come in a wide array of sizes and configurations. There is no single "106 size." The "106" prefix points to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), often Whirlpool. This OEM produces various refrigerator styles. Each style has its own range of dimensions and capacities.

Let's look at the common types of refrigerators and their general size ranges:

### Top-Freezer Refrigerators

These are the most traditional and often the most budget-friendly models. The freezer is at the top, and the fresh food section is below.
*   **Capacity:** Typically range from 14 to 21 cubic feet.
*   **Dimensions:** Usually narrower (28-32 inches wide) and taller than their bottom-freezer counterparts. They often have standard depths. Many older Kenmore 106 models fall into this category.

### Bottom-Freezer Refrigerators

The fresh food section is at eye level, and the freezer drawer or door is at the bottom. This design improves access to daily items.
*   **Capacity:** Often range from 18 to 24 cubic feet.
*   **Dimensions:** Similar widths to top-freezers, but can be slightly shorter or have different depth options.

### Side-by-Side Refrigerators

These models have two vertical doors that open side-by-side. One side is the freezer, and the other is the fresh food compartment. They offer excellent frozen food organization.
*   **Capacity:** Generally larger, ranging from 20 to 30 cubic feet.
*   **Dimensions:** Wider than top or bottom freezer models (32-36 inches wide). They often come in both standard and counter-depth options. Many Kenmore 106 models were produced as side-by-sides. Consider [how to level Kenmore side-by-side refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-level-kenmore-side-by-side-refrigerator) if you are thinking about installation or moving one.

### French Door Refrigerators

These are popular for their large fresh food section with two doors on top and a pull-out freezer drawer below. They combine the best of both worlds.
*   **Capacity:** The largest common type, usually 22 to 30+ cubic feet.
*   **Dimensions:** Often the widest (30-36 inches) and deepest, frequently available in counter-depth and standard-depth.

The "106" series encompasses various models from these categories. A "106" model could be a compact 14 cu. ft. top-freezer or a spacious 25 cu. ft. side-by-side. This underscores the need for the full model number. It is the only way to get accurate size information. Do not assume your "106" refrigerator has a specific size without looking up its complete details.

## Measuring Your Refrigerator's Dimensions for Fit

While knowing the cubic feet is important for capacity, the external dimensions are critical for fitting your refrigerator into its space. Online specifications provide standard measurements. However, always measure your specific unit and the space where it will go. This prevents costly mistakes. Minor variations in manufacturing or installation can affect the actual fit.

Here's a step-by-step guide to measuring your refrigerator and the surrounding area:

### Measuring the Refrigerator:

1.  **Height:** Measure from the floor to the very top of the refrigerator. Include any hinges or trim that might add to the height. If you have a top-hinged freezer door, make sure to measure to the absolute highest point.
2.  **Width:** Measure the widest point from side to side. This typically includes the doors. Some models have slightly wider doors or trim. Ensure you measure across the widest part of the main body.
3.  **Depth (without handles):** Measure from the back wall of the refrigerator to the front edge of the doors (excluding handles). This gives you the main body's depth.
4.  **Depth (with handles):** Measure from the back wall to the furthest point of the door handles. This is crucial if your refrigerator is in a high-traffic area. Handles can add several inches.
5.  **Depth (with door open 90 degrees):** Open one door fully to a 90-degree angle. Measure from the back wall to the furthest point of the opened door. This tells you how much space the door needs to swing open. You need enough clearance for drawers inside to pull out fully.

### Measuring the Opening (Alcove/Cabinetry):

1.  **Height:** Measure from the floor to the bottom of the cabinet or overhead obstruction. Measure at the front, middle, and back of the opening. Use the smallest measurement.
2.  **Width:** Measure the width of the opening from side to side. Measure at the top, middle, and bottom. Use the smallest measurement for fitting.
3.  **Depth:** Measure from the back wall to the front edge of your countertop or cabinets. This determines if you need a standard-depth or counter-depth refrigerator.
4.  **Clearance:** Account for at least one inch of clearance on each side, at the top, and at the back. This allows for proper air circulation. Without proper airflow, your refrigerator works harder. This can lead to inefficient cooling or breakdown. Proper clearance also makes installation easier.

Always double-check your measurements. Write them down clearly. Compare them to the specifications you find for your Kenmore refrigerator. This ensures a perfect fit.

## Why Knowing Your Kenmore Refrigerator's Size Matters

Knowing the precise size of your Kenmore refrigerator goes beyond simple curiosity. It is essential for several practical reasons. Whether you are replacing an old unit or optimizing your kitchen space, accurate size information provides significant benefits. It helps you make informed decisions and avoids potential problems.

Here are the key reasons why knowing your Kenmore refrigerator's size is important:

*   **Ensuring Proper Fit:** The most immediate reason is fit. You need to ensure the refrigerator fits into its designated space. This includes width, height, and depth. A refrigerator that is too wide or too tall will not fit into the opening. One that is too deep might stick out too far. This can block pathways or look awkward in your kitchen. Proper door swing clearance is also vital. You need to open the doors fully to access drawers and shelves.
*   **Kitchen Layout and Aesthetics:** The size of your refrigerator impacts your kitchen's overall design. A counter-depth model provides a built-in look. A standard-depth model offers more internal space but extends further into the room. Understanding your Kenmore 106's depth helps maintain a cohesive kitchen aesthetic.
*   **Capacity Needs:** The cubic feet capacity tells you how much food you can store. A small household might not need a large refrigerator. A large family requires more storage. Knowing your Kenmore 106's cubic feet helps you assess if its capacity meets your current and future needs. This is especially true if you are planning to upgrade.
*   **Energy Efficiency:** Refrigerator size often correlates with energy consumption. Larger refrigerators generally use more energy. Knowing your unit's size helps you understand its potential energy use. This is useful for budgeting and environmental considerations.
*   **Moving and Installation:** If you plan to move, knowing the dimensions helps determine if the refrigerator will fit through doorways and hallways. During installation, having the exact measurements ensures a smooth process. It prevents damage to your appliance or your home.
*   **Parts Replacement and Maintenance:** While not directly related to physical size, knowing your full model number is crucial for parts. If you need a new shelf, drawer, or other internal part, the size of the refrigerator impacts the part's dimensions. Although not directly related to size, knowing [how to find your Whirlpool refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-your-whirlpool-refrigerator-model-number) can be helpful since many Kenmore 106 models are manufactured by Whirlpool, making parts search easier.
*   **Resale Value:** When selling an appliance, providing accurate size and capacity information helps potential buyers. It gives them a clear understanding of what they are purchasing.

In short, accurate size information for your Kenmore refrigerator, including any model from the "106" series, empowers you. It helps you avoid frustrations and ensures your appliance serves your needs effectively.

## Resources for Kenmore Refrigerator Specifications

After finding your complete Kenmore refrigerator model number, you need reliable resources to look up its specifications. Official sources are always the best. They provide the most accurate details about dimensions, capacity, and features. Here are the primary places to find the exact specifications for your Kenmore refrigerator:

1.  **Sears PartsDirect Website:** This is often the most direct source for Kenmore appliance information. Since Kenmore was a Sears brand, Sears PartsDirect maintains an extensive database. You can enter your full model number on their website. It usually provides access to parts diagrams, owner's manuals, and product specifications. This is a top resource for any Kenmore appliance.
2.  **Original Owner's Manual:** If you kept the owner's manual that came with your Kenmore refrigerator, it is a goldmine of information. The manual includes a detailed specifications section. This section lists the exact cubic feet capacity, height, width, depth, and other relevant data. Always check this first if you have it.
3.  **Appliance Manufacturer Websites (OEM):** As mentioned, the "106" prefix often indicates Whirlpool as the manufacturer. You might try searching the Whirlpool website's support or product archives section. Enter your full Kenmore model number there. Sometimes, the Kenmore model number will cross-reference to an equivalent Whirlpool model. This can unlock specifications.
4.  **Online Appliance Retailer Archives:** Large online appliance retailers like Abt, AJ Madison, or even major big-box stores might have archived product pages. If they once sold your specific Kenmore model, its product page might still be accessible. These pages list full specifications.
5.  **Appliance Data Websites:** Several third-party websites specialize in appliance specifications. They collect data from various manufacturers. Be sure to use well-known and reputable sites. Cross-reference information if you use these sources, as data entry errors can occur.
6.  **Contact Kenmore/Sears Support:** If you cannot find the information online, or if your model is very old, you can try contacting Sears customer support. Provide them with your full model and serial number. They may be able to look up the specifications in their internal databases.

When using online resources, always double-check that the model number you entered matches exactly. Even a single digit difference can lead to incorrect information. Relying on official or well-established sources helps ensure you get the precise size details for your Kenmore refrigerator.
