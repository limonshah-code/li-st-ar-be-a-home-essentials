### Understanding Washing Machine Mould: Causes and Concerns

Mould often grows in damp, dark places. Your washing machine seal provides an ideal environment. Water collects in the folds of the rubber seal. Lint and detergent residues also accumulate there. These organic materials provide food for mould spores. The closed door of a washing machine traps moisture. This creates a perfect breeding ground.

Black mould is common in washing machine seals. It can appear as dark spots or streaks. This growth is not just cosmetic. It leads to unpleasant, musty odors. These smells transfer to your clothes. Mould also presents potential health risks. Spores can irritate airways. Some people experience allergic reactions or asthma flare-ups. Regular cleaning helps reduce these risks significantly. Understanding the causes helps you tackle the problem effectively.

### Essential Tools and Safety Precautions for Mould Removal

Before you start cleaning, gather your supplies. You will need certain items for safe and effective mould removal. Always prioritize your safety during this task. Mould can release spores during cleaning. Protecting yourself is important.

Here are the tools you will need:

*   **Rubber gloves:** Protect your hands from cleaning solutions.
*   **Safety goggles:** Shield your eyes from splashes and mould spores.
*   **Face mask:** Prevent inhaling mould spores or chemical fumes.
*   **Old cloths or sponges:** For scrubbing and wiping.
*   **Small brush or toothbrush:** To reach tight spots in the seal.
*   **Spray bottle:** For applying cleaning solutions.
*   **Bucket:** For mixing solutions and rinsing.

#### Bleach Solution Method

Bleach is a powerful disinfectant. It effectively kills mould and whitens surfaces. Use this method for stubborn, deep-seated mould.

1.  **Prepare the Solution:** Mix one part bleach with four parts water in a spray bottle. For example, use 1/4 cup bleach with 1 cup water. You can also soak a cloth directly in this solution.
2.  **Apply to the Seal:** Spray the bleach solution generously onto the entire rubber seal. Focus on the visibly mouldy areas.
3.  **Let it Sit:** Allow the bleach solution to sit on the seal for 10-15 minutes. This gives the bleach time to kill the mould. For severe mould, you can extend this time.
4.  **Scrub Thoroughly:** Use an old cloth or a small brush to scrub the mouldy areas. Pay special attention to the folds and crevices. These spots often hide mould.
5.  **Rinse Clean:** Wipe the seal thoroughly with a clean, damp cloth. Remove all bleach residue. Run
