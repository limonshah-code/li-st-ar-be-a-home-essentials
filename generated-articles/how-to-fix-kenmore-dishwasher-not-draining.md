## Understanding Why Your Kenmore Dishwasher Stalls

It's truly a mystery why your Kenmore dishwasher stops draining. Most times, the reason is simple. Knowing the common culprits helps you solve the problem faster. Dishwashers need a clear path for water to exit. Any interruption along this path stops the draining process. This can include food particles, grease, or even small objects.

Your Kenmore dishwasher relies on several components to drain water. The filter catches debris, preventing it from reaching the pump. The drain hose carries water away from the unit. The drain pump actively pushes water out. The air gap, if installed, prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Each part plays a crucial role. If one component fails or gets blocked, drainage stops. I always start my diagnosis with the easiest checks. This saves time and effort. Many problems are simple clogs. Other problems involve electrical or mechanical failures. Knowing the common reasons helps you approach the problem systematically.

## Checking and Cleaning Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter

The most common reason for a Kenmore dishwasher not draining is a clogged filter. My own experience confirms this. Food debris, soap scum, and other particles collect in the filter. Over time, this buildup restricts water flow. Your dishwasher tries to drain, but the water has nowhere to go. Regularly cleaning this filter prevents many drainage problems. This is a simple maintenance task. You can do it yourself without special tools.

Kenmore dishwashers typically have a cylindrical filter at the bottom. It often sits under the lower spray arm. Some models have multiple filter components. Start by removing the lower dish rack to access it easily. Twist the filter counter-clockwise to unlock it. Then, lift it out. Rinse the filter under running water. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away stubborn debris. You might find pieces of glass, labels, or food. Ensure all holes are clear. If your Kenmore dishwasher has an ultra-fine filter screen, separate it and clean it too. Once clean, reinsert the filter. Turn it clockwise to lock it in place. Make sure it sits securely. This step alone often solves the "Kenmore dishwasher not draining" problem.

## Inspecting the Drain Hose for Kinks or Blockages

After checking the filter, your next step is to examine the drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. This hose can become kinked, pinched, or clogged. A kink in the hose acts like a dam, stopping water flow. Blockages inside the hose are also common. Food particles, grease, or even mineral deposits can build up over time. I once found a stray piece of plastic from a food container inside a drain hose.

First, pull your Kenmore dishwasher out slightly if possible. Look behind the unit. Inspect the entire length of the drain hose. Ensure there are no sharp bends or kinks. Straighten any curves you find. Next, check where the hose connects to the sink drain or garbage disposal. Sometimes, blockages occur at these connection points. Disconnect the hose from the sink or disposal. Have a bucket ready to catch any water. Look inside the hose for debris. You can use a straightened coat hanger or a long wire brush to clear any clogs. Push it gently through the hose. Also, check the connection point on the sink or disposal. Ensure it is clear. Reconnect the hose securely. This simple check can save you a service call.

## Troubleshooting the Dishwasher Air Gap and Sink Drain

Many Kenmore dishwashers use an air gap. This small cylinder sits on your sink or countertop. It prevents dirty water from flowing back into your dishwasher. If your air gap gets clogged, your dishwasher will not drain. Food particles or grease can build up inside it. It's a critical, yet often overlooked, component. Checking it is straightforward.

First, remove the chrome cover from the air gap. Then, take off the plastic cap underneath. Look for any visible debris inside the unit. Use a paper towel or a small brush to clear out any gunk. You might see slimy residue or food bits. Sometimes, disconnecting the hoses from the air gap helps. Be ready with a towel, as some water may spill. Use a screwdriver to loosen the hose clamps. Remove the hoses and clean them thoroughly. Ensure the small nipple on the air gap where the dishwasher hose connects is clear. Also, check your sink drain. If your sink drain is completely clogged, the dishwasher cannot drain into it. Run water in your sink to check its drainage. Clear any clogs in your sink drain or garbage disposal first. A plunger or drain cleaner can help. If your dishwasher connects to a garbage disposal, ensure the disposal's knockout plug was removed during installation. A new disposal will have this plug. Remember that the dishwasher needs a clear path all the way out.

## Investigating the Drain Pump and Motor Assembly

If simple clogs are not the issue, your Kenmore dishwasher's drain pump or motor assembly might be the problem. The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the dishwasher. If it's faulty, obstructed, or worn out, your dishwasher will not drain. Sometimes, you might hear a humming sound, but no water moves. This indicates the pump motor runs but cannot move water. A loud grinding noise suggests an object inside the pump impeller.

Accessing the drain pump involves some effort. First, turn off the power to the dishwasher at your circuit breaker. You will likely need to remove the lower access panel of your dishwasher. Some Kenmore models require pulling the dishwasher out. Locate the drain pump, usually at the bottom of the unit. Inspect the impeller for foreign objects. Pieces of glass, plastic, or even bones can get lodged there. Carefully remove any obstructions. If the pump is clear but still not draining, the motor might be burned out. You can test the pump motor with a multimeter for continuity. If there is no continuity, the pump needs replacement. This is a more advanced repair. However, knowing the drain pump's role is crucial for complete troubleshooting. Many [dishwasher not draining problems](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-repair-dishwasher-not-draining) stem from this critical component.

## Examining the Drain Valve and Solenoid

Some Kenmore dishwashers use a drain valve or solenoid to control water flow during drainage. This component opens to allow water out and closes to keep water in. If the drain valve is stuck closed or the solenoid is faulty, your Kenmore dishwasher will not drain. The solenoid is an electromagnet that pulls a plunger to open the valve. A problem with this part stops water from leaving the wash tub.

To check this, you will need to access the underside of your dishwasher. Always disconnect power first. Locate the drain valve assembly. It's usually near the drain pump. Inspect the solenoid for any visible damage. Sometimes, the plunger might be stuck due to debris or corrosion. You can try to gently free it. Test the solenoid for continuity with a multimeter. If it shows an open circuit, the solenoid is bad. It needs replacement. Also, check the wiring connections to the solenoid. Loose or corroded wires can prevent it from receiving power. Ensure all connections are secure. If the solenoid is working, but the valve still does not open, the valve itself might be mechanically stuck. This often requires replacing the entire drain valve assembly. This repair can be tricky, but it's a common solution if other causes are ruled out.

## Checking the Float Switch and Overflow Protection

Your Kenmore dishwasher has a float switch. This safety device prevents the dishwasher from overflowing. It is usually a small plastic cup or rod located at the bottom of the tub. As water fills the tub, the float rises. If the water level gets too high, the float switch activates. It signals the control board to stop water intake or start the drain pump. If this float switch gets stuck in the "up" position, your dishwasher thinks there is too much water. It will try to drain continuously or refuse to start a new cycle. It also prevents the drain cycle from initiating correctly, leaving water in the tub.

To check the float switch, remove the lower dish rack. Look at the bottom of the tub, usually near the front. You will see a small plastic component that moves up and down. Push it down gently with your finger. Does it move freely and spring back up? If it feels sticky or is stuck, clean around it. Food debris or mineral deposits can cause it to stick. Use a damp cloth to wipe it clean. Ensure nothing is obstructing its movement. If the float moves freely but the draining issue persists, the switch itself might be faulty. You can test the float switch for continuity with a multimeter. With the switch in the "down" position, it should show continuity (closed circuit) for some models, or open for others. Consult your Kenmore dishwasher's service manual for specific testing procedures. Replacing a faulty float switch is generally an easy repair.

## Considering Electrical Issues and Control Board Failures

Sometimes, the problem isn't a mechanical blockage. Electrical issues can prevent your Kenmore dishwasher from draining. The drain pump needs power to operate. If it's not receiving power, it won't work. This can stem from a faulty wire, a bad connection, or a problem with the control board. The control board is like the brain of your dishwasher. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the "drain" signal.

First, check all wire connections. Ensure they are secure and free from corrosion. This involves checking connections at the drain pump, float switch, and control board. Always turn off power at the breaker before touching any wiring. Use a multimeter to check for voltage at the drain pump terminals when the dishwasher should be draining. No voltage means a wiring issue or a control board problem. A common issue is a burned-out relay on the control board. This relay controls power to the drain pump. Visually inspect the control board for burned spots or damaged components. If you find burn marks, the control board likely needs replacement. This is a more expensive repair. It also requires careful handling of electronic components. While less common than clogs, electrical failures do happen. They are important to consider if other troubleshooting steps fail.
