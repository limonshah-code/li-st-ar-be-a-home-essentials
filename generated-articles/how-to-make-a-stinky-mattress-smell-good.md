### Why Your Mattress Smells (and Why It Matters)

Let's talk about why your mattress might smell. Mattresses absorb a lot of things over time. This includes sweat, body oils, dead skin cells, and accidental spills. Pet accidents, food crumbs, or even just general humidity can also contribute. These things create a perfect environment for bacteria and mildew to grow. These tiny organisms are often the real cause of bad smells.
