### Takeaway

Washing your Ruggable rug is simple when you follow key steps:
*   Detach the cover from the pad before washing.
*   Wash the cover in a large washing machine with cold water and mild detergent.
*   Tumble dry on low heat or air dry to prevent damage.
*   Spot clean the rug pad and avoid machine washing it.

### How do you wash a Ruggable rug?

You wash a Ruggable rug by first separating its cover from the rug pad. Place the cover in a large capacity washing machine with cold water and a mild detergent. Dry the cover on a low heat setting or hang it to air dry. Do not machine wash the rug pad; instead, wipe it clean with a damp cloth.

## Preparing Your Ruggable for a Wash Cycle

Getting your Ruggable ready for washing makes the process easy. The Ruggable system uses two parts. You have a decorative top layer, which is the rug cover. Then you have a non-slip rug pad underneath. Only the rug cover goes into the washing machine. The rug pad stays out of the washer.

First, take the rug cover off the pad. It peels away easily. Start at one corner and gently pull the cover up. The cover will separate from the pad without much effort. Fold the rug cover carefully. This helps it fit better into your washing machine. A large capacity washer works best for bigger rugs.

Next, give the rug cover a good shake outside. This removes loose dirt and debris. You can also vacuum it first. Vacuuming picks up crumbs, pet hair, and surface dust. This pre-cleaning step prevents dirt from spreading in your washing machine. It also helps the washing process work better. Taking these steps sets you up for a clean rug.

## Washing the Ruggable Rug Cover Effectively

Washing your Ruggable rug cover properly ensures it stays in great shape. Always use a large capacity washing machine. Small washers may not give the rug enough room to move freely. This can lead to uneven cleaning. We want your rug to come out perfectly clean.

Use cold water for the wash cycle. Cold water helps prevent colors from fading. It also protects the fabric fibers. Hot water can sometimes shrink materials or damage them over time. We want your rug to last many years. Select a delicate or gentle cycle setting on your machine. This setting uses less agitation. Less agitation is kinder to the rug's fabric.

Add a mild, non-bleach detergent. Harsh chemicals or bleach can harm the rug's color and material. Do not use fabric softener. Fabric softener can leave a residue on the rug fibers. This residue might make the rug feel stiff or attract more dirt later. Simply using a good mild detergent works best. After the cycle finishes, the rug cover is ready for drying.

## Drying Your Ruggable Rug Cover Safely

Drying your Ruggable rug cover is just as important as washing it. Incorrect drying can cause shrinking or damage to the fabric. You have a few good options for drying your rug. The goal is to dry it gently and completely.

One option is machine drying. Use a low heat setting on your dryer. A low heat setting minimizes the risk of shrinking or heat damage. High heat can be too harsh for the rug's material. You can also add dryer balls. Dryer balls help to fluff the rug and reduce drying time. Make sure the rug moves freely in the dryer. If your rug is large, it might take longer to dry. Ensure it is fully dry before putting it back on the pad.

Another excellent drying method is air drying. You can hang your Ruggable rug cover over a clothesline or a sturdy drying rack. Make sure to hang it evenly to prevent stretching. Air drying is very gentle on the fabric. It helps keep the rug's shape and color. Air drying might take longer than machine drying. Pick a spot with good air circulation. Sunlight can help speed up drying, but too much direct sun might cause colors to fade over time.

Before reattaching the cover to the pad, ensure the rug cover is completely dry. Any dampness can lead to mildew or odors. If you are unsure, let it air dry a bit longer. This small step protects your rug and keeps it fresh.

## Caring for the Ruggable Rug Pad

The Ruggable rug pad is different from the cover. You should never put the rug pad in the washing machine. Machine washing can damage the pad's structure and its non-slip grip. The pad is designed to provide cushion and keep your rug from sliding. Keeping it in good condition is important for your rug's function.

Cleaning the rug pad is simple. If the pad gets dirty, use a damp cloth or sponge. Wipe down any spills or grime. For tougher spots, a little mild soap mixed with water works well. Just make sure to wipe off all soap residue afterwards. You do not want any sticky spots. Let the pad air dry completely before putting the rug cover back on.

The pad also needs occasional attention to keep its grip strong. Over time, dust and dirt can build up on its surface. This can make the pad less effective at preventing slips. Use a vacuum cleaner to gently clean the top of the pad. A broom also works to sweep away loose debris. This simple care keeps your Ruggable rug stable and safe. Proper care for your pad extends the life of your entire Ruggable system.

## Common Ruggable Washing Mistakes to Avoid

Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. Avoiding common mistakes helps your Ruggable last longer. One big mistake is washing the rug pad. As we discussed, the pad is not machine washable. Putting it in the washer can ruin its material and make it lose its grip. Always remember to separate the cover from the pad before washing.

Using hot water is another common error. Hot water can cause the rug cover to shrink. It can also make colors fade faster. Always use cold water for washing your Ruggable cover. This helps keep the rug's original size and vibrant colors. Many people forget to select a gentle cycle. A heavy-duty or normal cycle is too rough for the delicate rug fibers. Stick to the delicate or gentle wash setting to protect your rug.

Adding too much detergent or using harsh chemicals is also a mistake. Excess detergent can leave residue on the rug. Harsh chemicals, like bleach, can damage the fabric and colors. Use only a small amount of mild, non-bleach detergent. Fabric softener is also a no-go. It can coat the fibers and affect the rug's feel. Lastly, never put a damp rug cover back on the pad. Dampness can lead to mildew or bad smells. Ensure the cover is completely dry before reassembly. Avoiding these mistakes ensures your Ruggable stays beautiful and functional.

## When and How Often to Wash Your Ruggable

How often you wash your Ruggable depends on a few things. The amount of foot traffic your rug gets plays a big role. A rug in a busy entryway will need washing more often than one in a quiet bedroom. Pets and kids also increase the need for more frequent washing. Spills and accidents happen. This is a main reason why Ruggables are so popular.

For high-traffic areas or homes with pets and children, washing every 2-4 weeks is a good idea. This keeps the rug fresh and clean. For areas with less activity, you might only need to wash it every 1-2 months. If you see a visible stain or spill, wash it right away. Timely cleaning prevents stains from setting.

Between full washes, regular care helps. Vacuum your Ruggable rug cover often. This removes loose dirt and dust. You can use a low-pile setting on your vacuum. Spot cleaning is also very useful for small messes. If something spills, blot it quickly with a clean cloth. Do not rub the spill, as this can spread the stain. For tougher spots, use a mild cleaner made for rugs. Always test spot cleaners in a hidden area first.

Remember that the ease of washing Ruggables means you do not have to wait for them to look very dirty. Frequent washing helps maintain hygiene and keeps your home looking its best. The simple washing process makes this routine maintenance easy. [Are Ruggable rugs any good](https://homeessentialsguide.com/are-ruggable-rugs-any-good)?

## Reassembling Your Ruggable After Washing

Putting your Ruggable rug back together is the final step. It is a simple process, but doing it correctly helps the rug lie flat and look its best. First, make sure both the rug cover and the rug pad are completely dry. As mentioned before, any dampness can cause problems like mildew.

Lay the clean, dry rug pad on the floor where you want your rug to go. Make sure it is flat and smooth. Next, carefully place the rug cover over the pad. Start by aligning one corner of the cover with one corner of the pad. It helps if you have a second person to assist. One person can hold the cover straight, while the other smooths it down.

Work your way across the rug, smoothing out the cover as you go. The Ruggable cover uses a special cling material on its back. This material sticks gently to the rug pad. Press down firmly as you move across the rug. This ensures the cover adheres well to the pad. Remove any wrinkles or bubbles. If you see any, just lift that section of the cover and re-smooth it down. The design allows for easy repositioning. Once done, your Ruggable rug is ready for use again. It will look, feel, and smell fresh and clean.
