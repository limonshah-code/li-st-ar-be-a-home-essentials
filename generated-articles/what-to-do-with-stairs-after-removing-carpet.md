## Starting Fresh: Preparing Your Stairs After Carpet Removal

You have removed the old carpet from your stairs. Now, the real work begins. Proper preparation is very important. It sets the stage for a beautiful finish. You must clear away all debris first. This step ensures a smooth surface for any new treatment.

Start by removing all staples. Use needle-nose pliers or a pry bar. This takes time. Make sure you get every single one. You do not want any sharp points left behind. Next, scrape off old glue or padding residue. A floor scraper or putty knife works well. You can use a heat gun for stubborn glue spots. Be careful not to damage the wood. These early steps ensure a clean base. You will avoid bumps or uneven areas later.

After cleaning, inspect each step closely. Look for any loose or damaged treads. Check for loose risers too. Loose parts create unsafe stairs. They also look bad. Use wood glue to secure loose pieces. Use screws to reattach them if needed. Fill any large cracks or holes. Wood filler is good for this. Let it dry completely. Then, sand the patched areas smooth. This creates a uniform surface.
