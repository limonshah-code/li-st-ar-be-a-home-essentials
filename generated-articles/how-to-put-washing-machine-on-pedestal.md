### Why Install a Washing Machine Pedestal? Benefits & Ergonomics

Installing a washing machine pedestal offers several practical advantages. The most immediate benefit is ergonomic comfort. A pedestal raises your washing machine, often by 10-15 inches. This height reduces the need to bend over, making loading and unloading laundry much easier on your back and knees. This simple change can make laundry day less of a chore.

Beyond comfort, pedestals often provide valuable storage space. Many models come with a pull-out drawer. This drawer is perfect for storing laundry detergents, fabric softeners, and other cleaning supplies. Keeping these items organized and out of sight helps maintain a tidy laundry area. It also keeps supplies within easy reach when you need them.

Pedestals can also help reduce vibration. Some pedestals are designed with features that absorb vibrations during spin cycles. This can lead to a quieter laundry room experience. A stable base ensures your machine stays put, even during heavy loads. For those interested in a custom look or a DIY approach, you can even [how to build a washing machine pedestal](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-build-a-washing-machine-pedestal) that perfectly fits your space and needs.

In essence, a pedestal transforms your laundry routine. It brings the machine to a more natural working height. This promotes better posture and reduces physical strain. The added storage and potential for vibration dampening are excellent bonuses. It is an upgrade that improves both function and convenience in your home.

### Essential Preparations Before You Begin

Before you start moving your washing machine, proper preparation is important. Safety is the first thing to consider. You must unplug the washing machine from its power outlet. This prevents any accidental starts during the moving process. Next, turn off the water supply to the washing machine. You will find shut-off valves typically located behind or near the machine.

After disconnecting the power and water, you need to empty the machine. Remove any clothes or items from the drum. Also, drain any residual water from the hoses. Most washing machines have a small filter or drain hose near the bottom front for this purpose. Place a shallow pan or towel underneath to catch any drips. This step prevents water spills when you move the machine.

Clear the area around your washing machine and the pedestal installation spot. Make sure you have enough space to work safely. You need room to maneuver the heavy appliance. Remove any obstacles or trip hazards from your path. Having a clear workspace makes the job smoother and safer.

Gather all the tools you will need before starting. This list often includes moving straps, a level, wrenches, and a screwdriver. You might also need anti-vibration pads or shims. Check your pedestal's instructions for any specific tools required for attachment. Planning ahead ensures you do not stop mid-project to search for a missing tool.

### Choosing the Right Pedestal for Your Washer

Selecting the correct pedestal is a critical step for a successful installation. Not all pedestals fit all washing machines. You must ensure the pedestal is compatible with your specific washer model. Many appliance brands offer pedestals designed to match their washing machine lines. These are often model-specific or series-specific.

Check your washing machine's model number and refer to the manufacturer's website or manual. They will list compatible pedestals. Using a brand-specific pedestal often guarantees a perfect fit. It ensures secure attachment points and matching dimensions. For example, if you own a GE washer, you might look for information on [how to install ge washing machine pedestal](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-ge-washing-machine-pedestal) directly from GE or related guides.

Consider the pedestal's material and weight capacity. Washing machines are heavy appliances, especially when full of water. The pedestal must be sturdy enough to support the full weight of your machine. Most pedestals are made of strong steel or composite materials. Always verify the maximum weight limit specified by the pedestal manufacturer. This ensures long-term stability and safety.

Think about the features you want in your pedestal. Do you prefer a pull-out drawer for storage? Some pedestals offer open shelving instead. Drawers are popular for keeping laundry supplies neatly out of sight. Open shelves might be useful for larger, less frequently used items. Also, check the overall dimensions of the pedestal. It should not only fit your washer but also fit comfortably in your laundry space. Measure your available area before making a purchase.

### Safely Lifting and Positioning Your Washing Machine

Lifting a washing machine is a task that requires caution and help. These appliances are very heavy. Never attempt to lift a washing machine by yourself. Always enlist the help of at least one other person, preferably two. Two or three people can distribute the weight better. This reduces the risk of injury.

Use proper lifting equipment, such as moving straps or an appliance dolly. Moving straps go under the machine and over your shoulders. They help you lift with your legs, not your back. This technique protects your spine. An appliance dolly can move the machine close to the pedestal. However, you will still need to lift it off the dolly onto the pedestal.

When lifting, ensure everyone involved understands the plan. Coordinate your movements. Lift slowly and steadily. Keep your back straight and bend your knees. Lift using your leg muscles. Once the machine is high enough, carefully guide it over the pedestal. Position it directly above the pedestal.

Slowly lower the washing machine onto the pedestal. Ensure the feet of the washing machine align with the designated areas on the pedestal. Some pedestals have channels or indentations for the washer feet. Others have mounting brackets. Take your time during this step to prevent damage to the machine or the pedestal. Proper placement sets the stage for secure attachment. If your washing machine is prone to excessive movement during cycles, knowing [how to make washing machine not move](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-washing-machine-not-move) can be useful for additional stabilization.

### Securing Your Washing Machine to the Pedestal

Once your washing machine rests on the pedestal, the next step is to secure it. This process prevents the machine from shifting or falling during operation. Most pedestals come with specific attachment hardware. This hardware usually includes screws or brackets. These parts secure the washer's feet to the pedestal's top surface.

First, make sure the washing machine's feet are correctly seated in the pedestal's channels. If your pedestal uses mounting brackets, align the feet with these brackets. Use the screws or bolts provided by the pedestal manufacturer. Tighten these fasteners firmly. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the machine's feet or the pedestal. The goal is a snug and stable connection.

After securing the washer, check if it is level. An unlevel washing machine can vibrate excessively. It can also cause premature wear and tear. Use a spirit level placed on top of the washing machine. Adjust the leveling feet on the washing machine itself. Some pedestals also have adjustable feet. Turn the feet clockwise or counter-clockwise until the bubble on the spirit level is centered.

Once leveled, try to gently rock the washing machine. It should feel stable and not wobble. If there is any movement, recheck the leveling feet and the attachment screws. Proper leveling is essential for smooth and quiet operation. It ensures the washing machine functions as intended. This also prevents potential damage from excessive vibration.

### Reconnecting Utilities and Final Checks

After securing and leveling your washing machine on its new pedestal, you can reconnect all the utilities. Start by connecting the hot and cold water supply hoses. Make sure to match the hot water hose to the hot water intake and the cold hose to the cold water intake. Hand-tighten the connections first, then use a wrench for another quarter to half turn. Be careful not to overtighten, as this can strip the threads or damage the hose.

Next, connect the drain hose. Insert it securely into the standpipe or laundry tub. Ensure the drain hose forms a U-shape, or "air gap," where it enters the standpipe. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into your washing machine. Most washing machines require the drain hose to be at a specific height, usually between 30 and 36 inches from the floor. Check your washing machine's manual for the exact recommended height.

Once the water hoses and drain hose are connected, plug the washing machine's power cord back into the electrical outlet. Ensure the outlet is a grounded, three-prong type. Do not use extension cords. Now, slowly turn on the water supply valves. Check all hose connections for any leaks. Look closely at where the hoses connect to both the machine and the wall valves.

Finally, run a test cycle. Start with an empty, small load cycle. This allows you to observe the machine's performance. Watch for any unusual noises, excessive vibration, or leaks. Ensure the water fills and drains correctly. If you notice any issues, stop the cycle and recheck your connections and leveling. Understanding [what is a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-a-washing-machine) at a basic level helps in identifying potential problems during this test. A successful test cycle means your washing machine is ready for regular use on its new pedestal.
