An integrated grinder eliminates the need for a separate appliance and ensures you always have fresh grounds. Look for conical burr grinders, which provide a more consistent grind than blade grinders. The grind size also impacts shot quality. If your grinder isn't working, you might be facing a problem where your [Breville espresso machine grinder is not working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/breville-espresso-machine-grinder-not-working).

#### Water Reservoir Size and Accessibility

A larger water reservoir means fewer refills, which is convenient, especially if you make several drinks daily. Also, consider how easy it is to remove, fill, and clean the reservoir. Some machines feature top-loading reservoirs, while others pull out from the side or back. Easy access simplifies daily use and maintenance.

#### Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance

Espresso machines and frothers require regular cleaning. Milk residue can quickly clog steam wands or automatic frothing components. Look for machines with removable drip trays, easy-to-access brew groups, and simple steam wand purging mechanisms. Self-cleaning cycles for automatic frothers are a bonus. Regular cleaning prevents build-up and keeps your machine working optimally.
