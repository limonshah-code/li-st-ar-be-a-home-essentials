### Essential Preparations for Microwave Removal

Removing an appliance from your kitchen always begins with good preparation. This step is critical for a safe and easy removal. You need to gather the right tools and take important safety steps. Failing to prepare properly can lead to injury or damage to your kitchen.

Before you touch the microwave, take a moment to look around. Clear the area below and around the microwave. You want a clear path for when you take the unit down. Place a protective covering, like a blanket or cardboard, on your stovetop. This protects the surface from scratches or dents. I also like to have a stable step stool or a small ladder ready. This helps me reach the top of the microwave and inside the cabinet.

One of the most important things to do is to find a helper. Over-the-range microwaves are heavy appliances. They can weigh 60 pounds or more. Trying to remove one alone is risky. A helper can support the weight as you unbolt it. This prevents the microwave from falling. It also protects you from strain or injury. Teamwork makes this job much easier and safer.

Finally, make sure you have all the necessary tools. This avoids delays once you start the job. You will need a Phillips head screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, and a drill with various bits. Pliers can also be helpful. A voltage tester is a very smart tool to have. It confirms the power is off before you touch any wires. Good preparation saves time and keeps you safe.

### Prioritizing Electrical Safety: Disconnecting Power

Electrical safety is the most important step when you remove any appliance. Your Goldstar over-the-range microwave connects directly to your home's electrical system. Working with electricity without proper precautions can cause serious injury. Always assume wires are live until proven otherwise.

First, you must turn off the power to the microwave. Do this at your home's main electrical panel, also called the breaker box. Locate the circuit breaker labeled for your kitchen or specifically for the microwave. If labels are unclear, you might need to turn off the main breaker for your whole house. Flip the switch to the "OFF" position. You should hear a click.

After turning off the breaker, test the microwave to ensure no power. Try to turn it on or check if the display lights up. If it does not power on, you have successfully cut the electricity. For added safety, use a non-contact voltage tester. Touch the tester to the microwave's power outlet or any visible wires. The tester will beep or light up if power is still present. If it still has power, double-check your breaker box. Make sure you flipped the correct switch.

Once you confirm the power is off, you can disconnect the microwave's power source. Most over-the-range microwaves plug into an outlet inside the cabinet above them. Reach into the upper cabinet and unplug the microwave's power cord from the wall outlet. If your Goldstar microwave is hardwired, meaning it does not have a plug, you will need more care. You must locate the junction box inside the upper cabinet. Here, you will find wires connected with wire nuts. Carefully remove the wire nuts and separate the wires. Always remember which wires connected to what (usually black to black, white to white, green to ground). Take a picture if it helps. This step is vital for your safety and for preparing for the next appliance. If you are unsure about hardwiring, consider calling an electrician. This prevents electrical hazards.

### Managing Ventilation and Mounting Hardware

After ensuring the power is off, the next step is to handle the microwave's ventilation system. Over-the-range microwaves often serve as kitchen vents. They either recirculate air or vent it outside. Understanding your Goldstar model's setup is important for a smooth removal.

Some microwaves have a recirculation system. This means they filter the air and blow it back into the kitchen. These models usually do not have external ductwork. You will simply need to remove a top vent cover. Other microwaves connect to a ventilation duct that goes outside. This duct can go through the wall or up through the cabinet and roof. If you have a ducted system, you will see metal or plastic ductwork above the microwave, inside the upper cabinet.

To disconnect ducted ventilation, first, open the upper cabinet doors. Look for a large metal or plastic duct connected to the top of the microwave. This duct is often held in place with screws or metal tape. Use a screwdriver to remove any screws holding the duct to the microwave's vent opening. You may also need to carefully peel back any tape. Gently separate the duct from the microwave. Be careful not to bend or damage the ductwork. You might reuse it for your new appliance. For more insights on how these systems work, you can review guides on [how to install over the range microwave with vent](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-over-the-range-microwave-with-vent).

Once the ventilation is free, focus on the microwave's mounting hardware. Over-the-range microwaves typically mount in two places. They have a metal mounting plate secured to the wall studs behind the microwave. They also have bolts that go through the bottom of the upper cabinet into the top of the microwave.

To find the cabinet bolts, look inside the upper cabinet directly above the Goldstar microwave. You will see two or three large bolts sticking down through the cabinet floor. These bolts screw directly into the top of the microwave. Use a screwdriver or a socket wrench to loosen these bolts. Do not remove them completely yet. Just loosen them enough so they can easily slide out when the microwave is lowered. These bolts carry much of the microwave's weight, so support is critical during this part of the process.

### Safely Lowering and Detaching the Appliance

This stage is where your helper becomes essential. The microwave is heavy and awkward to handle alone. Having a second person prevents damage and injury. Before you loosen the final bolts, have your helper ready to support the microwave from below.

Once the power, ventilation, and cabinet bolts are addressed, you are ready to remove the microwave. Have your helper stand in front of the microwave, firmly grasping its bottom. They need to be ready to take the full weight. Now, you can remove the remaining cabinet bolts completely. Work slowly and carefully. As the last bolt comes out, the microwave will rest on the wall mounting plate and the helper's support.

The Goldstar over-the-range microwave typically hangs on a metal plate. This plate is attached to the wall studs. The microwave has slots on its back that hook onto this plate. To detach it, you and your helper need to tilt the microwave slightly away from the wall at the top. Then, carefully lift it up and out from the mounting plate. Imagine it like unhooking a picture frame from a nail, but much heavier. Once it's off the plate, slowly lower the microwave onto your protected stovetop or directly to the floor. Make sure your helper maintains a firm grip throughout this process.

After the microwave is safely on the ground, move it out of the way. Place it in a secure spot where it won't be in the way or get damaged. If you are replacing the microwave immediately, you might move it to an adjacent countertop or clear space. If you are completely removing it without immediate replacement, you can move it outside or to a garage for temporary storage.

Sometimes, microwaves can be stubborn to detach. If it feels stuck, double-check that all cabinet bolts are completely removed. Also, ensure no hidden screws or clips are holding it to the wall. Older models or those installed very tightly can require a bit more wiggling. Take your time and communicate clearly with your helper. Proper technique makes all the difference in this heavy lifting task.

### Post-Removal Cleanup and Next Steps

Once the Goldstar over-the-range microwave is safely removed, your work is not quite finished. You have a few more steps to ensure the area is clean and ready for whatever comes next. This includes cleaning, deciding what to do with the mounting plate, and planning for your old appliance's disposal.

First, take a good look at the space where the microwave used to be. You will likely find grease, dust, and food splatters on the wall and under the upper cabinet. This is a great time to deep clean this often-neglected area. Use a degreaser and an all-purpose cleaner to scrub the wall, the back of the upper cabinet, and the stovetop area. A clean space looks better and is healthier. It also provides a clean base if you are installing a new appliance.

Next, decide what to do with the wall mounting plate. This metal bracket is usually screwed into the wall studs. If you are installing a new over-the-range microwave, check its instructions. Most new microwaves come with their own specific mounting plate. It is rare for different models, even from the same brand, to use the exact same plate. Therefore, you will likely need to remove the old Goldstar mounting plate. Use a drill or screwdriver to remove the screws holding it to the wall. Keep these screws if you need to patch the holes later.

After removing the plate, you will see screw holes in your wall. If you are installing a new microwave, these holes might be covered by the new unit. If not, or if you are simply leaving the space empty, you might want to patch the holes. Use spackle or wall putty, sand it smooth when dry, and then paint to match your wall. This makes your kitchen look neat and finished.

Finally, think about how to dispose of your old Goldstar microwave. Appliances cannot just go into regular trash. They contain electronic components and metals that need special handling. Many municipalities have specific drop-off points for electronics and appliances. Some waste management companies offer bulk pickup services for a fee. You might also find local recycling centers or scrap metal yards that accept old microwaves. If the microwave still works, consider donating it to a charity or offering it for free online. Properly disposing of the microwave helps the environment.

### Common Challenges and Solutions During Removal

Even with careful planning, sometimes you might face unexpected issues when you remove a Goldstar over-the-range microwave. Knowing what common challenges might arise can help you be prepared. It also helps you find solutions quickly.

One common challenge is dealing with stubborn cabinet bolts. These bolts pass through the upper cabinet and screw into the top of the microwave. Over time, they can rust, strip, or become very tight. If a bolt won't turn, try applying a penetrating oil, like WD-40, and let it sit for a few minutes. Use a wrench or vice grips for extra leverage if a screwdriver isn't enough. If the bolt head strips, you might need a bolt extractor kit. These kits help grip damaged screws and remove them. Remember to apply firm, steady pressure when turning.

Another issue can be the sheer weight of the microwave. Even with a helper, it can feel heavier than expected. Ensure both you and your helper use proper lifting techniques. Bend at your knees, not your back. Communicate clearly about when to lift and how to balance the weight. If the unit is exceptionally heavy or awkward, consider renting an appliance dolly to move it once it's on the floor. For future installations, you might wonder about the proper height; read more about [how high does over the range microwave need to be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-high-does-over-the-range-microwave-need-to-be).

Sometimes, wires or ductwork can be difficult to disconnect. Electrical wires might be stiff or routed in tight spaces. Always reconfirm the power is off before touching wires. Use insulated tools for added safety. If ductwork is tightly sealed with mastic or many layers of tape, use a utility knife to carefully cut through it. Take care not to damage the cabinet or the duct itself if you plan to reuse it.

If your Goldstar microwave is very old, you might encounter outdated wiring or non-standard mounting. Older appliances sometimes use different connection methods. If you find unfamiliar wiring, do not guess. It is always safer to consult an electrician for professional help. They can ensure electrical connections are safe and up to code. Also, older models might have accumulated more grease and grime, making them stick to the wall. A gentle rocking motion can help loosen it from the mounting plate.

Finally, you might find that the wall behind the microwave needs repair. Sometimes, the drywall gets damaged during installation or removal. Small holes or tears are common. You can patch these with joint compound or spackle. For larger damaged areas, you might need to cut out a section of drywall and replace it. Knowing how to handle these minor repairs helps you finish the job completely. This prepares your kitchen for a new appliance or other kitchen changes.

### Preparing for a New Appliance or Kitchen Changes

Once your Goldstar over-the-range microwave is successfully removed, you have an open space. This space is now ready for your next steps. Many people remove an old microwave to install a new one. Others might decide to make bigger changes to their kitchen. Planning what comes next helps you get the most from your effort.

If you are installing a new over-the-range microwave, check its specific requirements. While many OTR microwaves follow similar dimensions, some brands or models have unique needs. Pay attention to the new microwave's mounting plate. Almost always, you will use the new plate that comes with the new appliance. Do not assume the old Goldstar plate will work. Also, check the electrical requirements. Most OTR microwaves use a standard 120-volt outlet. However, confirm that your existing outlet matches the new unit's needs. For a full guide, check our article on [can I install an over-the-range microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-install-an-over-the-range-microwave).

Consider the ventilation for your new microwave. Will it vent the same way as your old Goldstar? Some microwaves can be configured for outside venting, top venting, or recirculating. Choose the option that best fits your kitchen. If you need to change your venting setup, now is the time to plan that. You might need new ductwork or to cap off an old vent opening.

Perhaps you do not plan to install another over-the-range microwave. This open space provides new opportunities for your kitchen. You could install a stylish range hood instead. A range hood offers powerful ventilation and can be a design feature. You might also consider filling the space with a new cabinet. This adds storage to your kitchen. Some people opt for a countertop microwave instead.
