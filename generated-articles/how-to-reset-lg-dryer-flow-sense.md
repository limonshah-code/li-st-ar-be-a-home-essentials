## Understanding LG Dryer Flow Sense

Your LG dryer has a smart feature called Flow Sense. This system monitors airflow through the dryer vent. It ensures proper ventilation during drying cycles. Good airflow is essential for efficient drying. It also prevents overheating.

When the dryer detects a significant restriction in airflow, it triggers the Flow Sense error. The dryer may display a warning light or a specific code. This warning is not a fault in the dryer itself. It signals a problem with your dryer's ventilation. This system protects your dryer from damage. It also reduces fire risks caused by lint buildup. Ignoring this warning can lead to safety hazards. It can also cause long-term damage to your appliance. Understanding [why your LG dryer says Flow Sense](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-say-flow-sense) is the first step to a proper fix.

Common reasons for Flow Sense activation include a clogged lint trap. The exhaust vent hose or external vent cap can also be blocked. Improper dryer installation can cause airflow issues. For example, a long or kinked vent hose can restrict air. Always address the Flow Sense error promptly.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Resetting Your LG Dryer Flow Sense

Resetting your LG dryer's Flow Sense is usually a simple process. Often, a basic power cycle is enough. This helps the dryer clear its memory and re-evaluate airflow. I find this first step fixes many minor issues.

### Basic Power Cycle Reset

1.  **Unplug the Dryer:** Disconnect the dryer's power cord from the wall outlet. This cuts off all power to the appliance. Wait at least 10 to 15 minutes. This allows any residual power to drain from the dryer's circuits.
2.  **Restore Power:** Plug the dryer back into the wall outlet. Ensure it is firmly seated. This reboots the dryer's control board. The Flow Sense error light should now be off.
3.  **Test the Dryer:** Run a small load or a timed drying cycle. Observe if the Flow Sense error returns. If it does, a simple reset is not enough. You need to investigate further.

### Advanced Reset for Persistent Issues

If the basic reset does not work, there is likely an underlying airflow problem. This often means a blockage exists. The dryer needs a complete restart after fixing the blockage.

1.  **Turn Off Power at the Breaker:** Go to your home's electrical panel. Find the circuit breaker labeled for your laundry room or dryer. Flip the breaker to the "OFF" position. This ensures no power reaches the dryer.
2.  **Address the Underlying Issue:** This is the crucial part. Proceed to the next sections to clean your dryer's lint trap and vent system thoroughly. This step is necessary before a successful reset.
3.  **Restore Power:** Once cleaning is complete, go back to your electrical panel. Flip the dryer's circuit breaker back to the "ON" position. This powers up the dryer.
4.  **Run a Test Cycle:** Start a drying cycle. The Flow Sense light should now be off. If the problem persists, the issue might be more complex. Learning [how to reset your LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-lg-dryer-front-load) in general can help here, as the steps are similar for many issues. Sometimes, dryer issues can even lead to problems like [your LG electric dryer not heating](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-lg-electric-dryer-not-heating), which a flow sense reset might indirectly help.

Always ensure the dryer is unplugged or powered off at the breaker when working on it. Safety first is my motto.

## The Critical Role of Dryer Vent Cleaning

Cleaning your dryer's vent system is the most common solution for a Flow Sense error. Lint buildup is the primary culprit. This lint restricts airflow, making your dryer less efficient. It also creates a serious fire hazard. I always make sure to clean mine regularly.

### Cleaning the Lint Trap

This is the easiest and most frequent cleaning task.

1.  **Clean After Every Load:** Pull out the lint screen, usually located in the dryer door opening. Remove all accumulated lint. This simple step prevents a lot of problems.
2.  **Wash Periodically:** Every few months, wash the lint screen with warm, soapy water. Use a soft brush to remove any residue from fabric softener sheets. Rinse it thoroughly and let it air dry completely before putting it back. This prevents a thin film from building up, which can also restrict airflow.

### Cleaning the Dryer Vent Hose

This requires a bit more effort but is crucial.

1.  **Disconnect the Hose:** Pull your dryer away from the wall. Locate the flexible exhaust vent hose connected to the back of the dryer and the wall. Loosen the clamps securing it. Carefully disconnect the hose from both ends.
2.  **Inspect and Clean:** Check the entire length of the hose for kinks, crushes, or tears. Straighten any kinks. Use a vacuum cleaner with a narrow attachment to remove lint from inside the hose. For heavy buildup, you might need a dryer vent brush kit. These kits attach to a drill and make cleaning easy.
3.  **Check the Dryer's Exhaust Port:** While the hose is disconnected, inspect the exhaust port on the back of the dryer. Use your vacuum to clean out any lint here.
4.  **Reattach Securely:** Once clean, reattach the hose to the dryer and the wall. Ensure all connections are tight and secure with clamps. Make sure the hose is not kinked behind the dryer.

### Cleaning the External Vent Cap

Do not forget the vent cap outside your house.

1.  **Locate the Vent Cap:** Find where your dryer vents outside your home. This is usually on an exterior wall.
2.  **Remove Debris:** Open the flap of the vent cap. Remove any lint, dust, bird nests, or other debris that might be trapped there. Use a brush or your hand.
3.  **Inspect Flap Operation:** Ensure the flap opens freely when the dryer is running. A stuck or broken flap will restrict airflow.
4.  Cleaning your dryer regularly, including the internal and external parts, is key to preventing problems. Here is a general guide on [how to clean an LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer) which covers more than just the vents.

## Checking for Common Airflow Obstructions Beyond Lint

While lint is the main culprit, other issues can cause Flow Sense errors. These problems relate to the physical setup of your dryer's ventilation. It is good to check these, especially if cleaning the lint filter and basic vent hose does not help. I have seen many cases where these less obvious issues were the cause.

### Inspecting the Vent Hose Itself

The flexible hose connecting your dryer to the wall vent can be a source of problems.

1.  **Kinks and Crushes:** Pull the dryer out from the wall. Examine the entire length of the vent hose. Ensure there are no sharp bends, kinks, or crushed sections. These restrict airflow significantly. Straighten any kinks. If the hose is crushed, you may need to replace it.
2.  **Length and Material:** A vent hose that is too long or has too many turns reduces airflow. Keep it as short and straight as possible. Use rigid metal ducting whenever possible. Flexible foil or plastic ducts are more prone to kinks and lint buildup. They are also less fire-resistant. If your hose is long or made of improper material, consider upgrading it.

### Outdoor Vent Inspection and Clearance

The final exit point for your dryer's air needs to be clear.

1.  **Debris and Pests:** Check the exterior vent hood for any blockages. Birds can build nests inside, and small animals or insects can get trapped. Leaves or other outdoor debris can also accumulate. Remove any obstructions.
2.  **Vent Hood Type:** Ensure your exterior vent hood has a working flap or louver system. This keeps pests out but opens freely when the dryer runs. Some older or decorative hoods can restrict airflow too much. Consider upgrading if yours is problematic.
3.  **Proximity to Other Objects:** Make sure nothing is blocking the vent's opening outside. This includes shrubs, fences, or stored items. There should be clear space around the vent. While some people might look for ways to [bypass LG dryer Flow Sense](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-bypass-lg-dryer-flow-sense), understanding and fixing these airflow issues is always the safest and most effective solution. Bypassing can create fire hazards.

Addressing these physical obstructions is often the key to resolving stubborn Flow Sense errors.

## Post-Reset Steps and Testing Your Dryer

After you have performed the reset and thoroughly cleaned your dryer's vent system, it is time to test it. This step ensures that your efforts have resolved the Flow Sense error. It also helps confirm proper dryer operation. I always recommend a test run.

1.  **Initial Power-Up Check:** Plug your dryer back into the wall outlet or flip the circuit breaker back on. Listen for any unusual sounds. Check if the display screen lights up normally. The Flow Sense error light should now be off. If it is still on, repeat the reset steps and re-check for any missed blockages.
2.  **Run a Test Load:** Place a small load of damp towels into the dryer. Towels are good for testing because they hold a lot of water. Choose a regular drying cycle. This allows the dryer to run for a sufficient period.
3.  **Monitor Drying Performance:**
    *   **Drying Time:** Note how long the cycle takes. It should be consistent with normal drying times for a similar load. Longer than usual times suggest remaining airflow issues.
    *   **Clothes Dryness:** Check if the clothes are fully dry at the end of the cycle. Damp clothes indicate poor drying performance.
    *   **Airflow at Vent:** Go outside and feel the air coming out of the external vent during the cycle. You should feel strong, warm airflow. Weak or cool airflow means air is still restricted.
    *   **Dryer Temperature:** The dryer should not feel excessively hot to the touch on the outside. Overheating can signal an issue.
4.  **Observe for Error Return:** Pay close attention to the dryer's display. See if the Flow Sense error light or code reappears during or after the cycle. If it does, there is still an unresolved airflow problem. You might need to re-examine the vent system or consider professional help. Running a successful test load provides peace of mind.

## When to Seek Professional Help

Most Flow Sense errors resolve with a thorough cleaning and reset. However, there are times when professional help is necessary. If you have followed all the steps and the Flow Sense error persists, it is time to call an expert. I know when a job is beyond my skill set.

### Persistent Flow Sense Error

If the Flow Sense light keeps coming back, even after deep cleaning and resets, an internal component might be faulty. The dryer's airflow sensor (thermistor), blower motor, or control board could be malfunctioning. These parts require specialized knowledge for diagnosis and repair.

### Unusual Noises or Smells

If you hear strange noises like grinding or squealing, or smell burning plastic or rubber, stop using the dryer immediately. These indicate a serious mechanical problem. It could be a failing motor or a component rubbing against something it shouldn't. Continued use can cause further damage or create a fire hazard.

### Dryer Not Heating

Sometimes, a severe airflow restriction can cause the dryer to stop heating. This happens because the high-limit thermostat trips for safety. If your dryer runs but does not heat, and the Flow Sense error is active, it is often related to airflow. However, if you have cleared all airflow issues and the dryer still does not heat, the heating element or thermostat might be bad. While you can look up [how to reset an LG dryer heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-lg-dryer-heating-element), professional diagnosis ensures the correct part is replaced safely.

### Visible Damage or Complex Issues

If you see physical damage to internal components, or if you suspect a complex electrical issue, do not attempt the repair yourself. Appliance technicians have the tools and training to diagnose and fix these problems safely. They can identify subtle issues you might miss. It is always better to be safe when dealing with electrical appliances.

## Preventing Future Flow Sense Issues

Preventing Flow Sense errors is much easier than fixing them. Regular maintenance and proper usage extend your dryer's life. They also keep your home safe. I prioritize these steps in my own home.

### Regular Lint Trap Cleaning

Make cleaning the lint trap a habit after every single load. This simple action prevents lint buildup. It is the number one cause of restricted airflow. A clean lint trap ensures maximum airflow from the start of each cycle. This improves drying efficiency.

### Annual Vent Cleaning

Commit to a thorough dryer vent cleaning at least once a year. If you use your dryer frequently, or have pets that shed a lot, consider doing it every six months. This involves disconnecting the vent hose. It also means cleaning the entire length of the ducting. Do not forget the exterior vent cap. Many homeowners hire professional vent cleaners for this service. They have specialized tools to remove stubborn lint and debris.

### Proper Dryer Installation

Ensure your dryer is installed correctly. The vent hose should be as short and straight as possible. Avoid sharp bends or kinks. Use rigid metal ducting instead of flexible foil or plastic if possible. Rigid ducts offer better airflow and are more durable. They also pose less of a fire risk. Make sure all vent connections are sealed properly to prevent air leaks.

### Avoid Overloading Your Dryer

Overloading the dryer prevents proper tumbling. This leads to longer drying times. It can also force more lint into the vent system. Stick to recommended load sizes for your dryer model. This helps maintain good airflow and reduces strain on the dryer.

### Check Laundry Items

Before drying, check pockets and remove small items. Things like tissues or plastic can melt or break apart in the dryer. This can then clog the lint trap or vent. Small items of clothing can also block the exhaust. By following these preventative measures, you significantly reduce the chances of encountering the Flow Sense error. You also keep your dryer running efficiently and safely for years to come.
