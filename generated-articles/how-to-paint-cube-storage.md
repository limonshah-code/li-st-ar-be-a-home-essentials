## How To Paint Cube Storage for a Fresh Look

Do you own a tired-looking cube storage unit? Maybe you want to match it with your room's new decor. Painting your cube storage is an easy and effective way to give it a complete makeover. It is a fantastic DIY project that adds a personal touch to any space.

I will guide you through each step of this rewarding process. You will learn about preparing the surface, choosing the right paint, and applying it for a smooth finish. This article covers everything from gathering tools to applying protective layers. Get ready to transform your cube organizer into a stylish piece.

### Takeaway:

*   **Prepare Thoroughly:** Clean, sand, and prime your cube storage unit for best results.
*   **Choose Wisely:** Select paint and primer suitable for your unit's material (wood, laminate, particle board).
*   **Apply Evenly:** Use thin, multiple coats for a professional-looking finish.
*   **Protect Your Work:** Apply a topcoat to ensure durability and longevity.

Painting cube storage involves cleaning, sanding, and priming the surface first. Then, apply several thin coats of chosen paint, allowing proper drying time between each. Finish the unit with a clear protective topcoat for durability. This process refreshes the look and extends the life of your storage unit.

### 1. Why Paint Your Cube Storage? Revitalize Your Space

Do you look at your cube storage and feel it lacks personality? Painting is a simple answer. It can turn a basic piece of furniture into a custom design element. This transformation updates your room without buying new items.

Painting is also cost-effective. New furniture can be expensive. A can of paint costs far less and offers the same fresh appeal. You can easily match existing decor or try a bold new color. This makes your storage unit truly yours.

Cube storage units are often made from practical materials like laminate or particle board. These materials can look plain. Paint covers these surfaces well. It creates a smooth, new look. You can also [paint over painted furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-over-painted-furniture) if your unit already has a coat.

This project offers a creative outlet. You choose the colors and finishes. This freedom helps you express your style. It turns a functional item into a display piece. I find great satisfaction in seeing a drab item become vibrant again.

### 2. Gathering Your Painting Arsenal: Essential Tools and Materials

Before you start, you need the right supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. It prevents interruptions and ensures a good outcome. I always make a checklist before starting any project.

Here is what you will need:

*   **Drop Cloths or Plastic Sheeting:** These protect your floors and surrounding areas from paint spills. I use old sheets or plastic tarps.
*   **Cleaner:** A degreaser or mild soap and water works well. This removes dirt and grime.
*   **Sandpaper:** Start with 120-grit for initial sanding. Then use 220-grit for a smoother finish. A sanding block helps.
*   **Painter's Tape:** Use good quality tape to protect areas you do not want to paint. This includes edges or inside compartments.
*   **Primer:** This is crucial for adhesion, especially on laminate or glossy surfaces. Choose a bonding primer.
*   **Paint:** Select a paint suitable for furniture. Latex or acrylic-based paints work well. If you have questions about specific types, you can learn more about [how to paint furniture with latex paint](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-furniture-with-latex-paint).
*   **Paint Brushes:** Good quality synthetic brushes for edges and small areas.
*   **Paint Rollers:** A small foam roller or a dense nap roller for smooth surfaces. This covers large areas quickly.
*   **Paint Tray:** To hold paint for your roller.
*   **Stir Stick:** To mix your paint thoroughly.
*   **Protective Topcoat/Sealer:** A clear coat like polyurethane or polycrylic. This protects the painted surface.
*   **Screwdriver:** For disassembling parts if needed, such as removing legs or doors. If your unit has legs, you might consider how to [add legs to cube storage](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-add-legs-to-cube-storage) for added height or style.
*   **Rags or Microfiber Cloths:** For cleaning and wiping dust.

These materials ensure you have a successful painting experience. Make sure your painting area has good ventilation too.

### 3. Preparation is Key: Setting the Stage for a Perfect Finish

Proper preparation is the most important step in painting cube storage. Skipping steps here leads to poor results. A clean, smooth surface ensures paint adhesion and a professional finish. I cannot stress this enough; preparation makes all the difference.

First, **disassemble your unit** if possible. Remove any doors, drawers, or shelves. This allows you to paint all surfaces evenly. It also prevents paint drips on hidden parts. If you just assembled your unit, you might want to disassemble it again.

Next, **clean the entire surface thoroughly**. Use a degreaser or a mixture of mild soap and water. Wipe down every inch to remove dust, dirt, grease, and grime. Residue can prevent paint from sticking. Rinse with clean water and let the unit dry completely.

Now, **sand the surfaces**. If your cube storage is made of laminate or a glossy material, a light sanding is critical. Use 120-grit sandpaper to scuff the surface. This creates "tooth" for the primer to grip. For wooden units, sand with 120-grit, then 220-grit sandpaper to smooth out any imperfections. This also helps with [how to paint wood furniture white](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-wood-furniture-white) or any color. Wipe away all sanding dust with a damp cloth, then a dry one. Ensure no dust remains.

**Repair any damage**. Fill small holes or dents with wood filler. Let it dry, then sand it smooth. This creates a uniform surface. Your goal is a perfectly smooth canvas for your paint.

Finally, **tape off any areas you do not want painted**. This includes hinges, the inside of cubbies if you are only painting the exterior, or the very edges if you want a clean line. Use good quality painter's tape for sharp lines. This meticulous preparation prevents future paint problems.

### 4. Priming Your Cube Storage: The Foundation for Lasting Color

Priming is a non-negotiable step when painting cube storage. It acts as a bridge between the unit's original material and your new paint. Primer creates a uniform surface. It helps the paint adhere better and last longer.

Choosing the right primer depends on your cube storage material. For laminate, particle board, or any glossy surface, use a **bonding primer**. This type of primer is designed to stick to slick, non-porous surfaces where regular primer would fail. Zinsser B-I-N Shellac-Base Primer or Kilz Adhesion are excellent choices. If your unit is solid wood, a standard all-purpose primer will suffice.

Before applying, **stir the primer well**. This ensures all ingredients are mixed. Use a brush for edges and corners. Then, use a small foam roller for the larger, flat surfaces. Apply a thin, even coat. Avoid applying it too thick, as this can lead to drips or an uneven finish.

**Allow the primer to dry completely** according to the manufacturer's instructions. This usually takes a few hours. Drying time is important. Do not rush this step. Once dry, lightly sand the primed surface with 220-grit sandpaper. This smooths out any bumps or imperfections that appeared during priming. Wipe away all dust before moving on. I usually run my hand over the surface to check for smoothness.

Some projects, especially those with dark original colors or challenging surfaces, might benefit from a second coat of primer. If you're going from dark to a [how to paint desk white](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-desk-white) or another light color, two coats ensure full coverage. This foundation ensures your paint looks vibrant and stays put for years.

### 5. The Art of Painting: Applying Your Chosen Color

Now comes the fun part: applying the paint. This is where your cube storage truly begins to transform. Proper painting technique leads to a smooth, factory-like finish. Rushing this stage often results in visible brush strokes or uneven coverage.

First, **stir your paint thoroughly**. Make sure the color is consistent. Pour a small amount into your paint tray. Use a high-quality synthetic brush for cutting in edges and corners. Apply paint in smooth, even strokes. Do not overload your brush.

For larger, flat surfaces, use a small foam roller. This gives the smoothest finish on furniture. Roll in one direction, overlapping slightly with each pass. Apply thin coats. Thick coats take longer to dry and are more prone to drips and unevenness. Multiple thin coats are always better than one thick coat. If you are painting an item like [how to paint a table black](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-a-table-black), thin coats are critical for a streak-free dark finish.

**Allow each coat to dry completely** before applying the next. This is crucial for adhesion and durability. Check the paint can for recommended drying times. It can range from 2-4 hours for touch-dry, but often 24 hours for full cure. Lightly sand between coats with 220-grit sandpaper if needed. This smooths any minor imperfections and helps the next coat adhere. Always wipe away sanding dust.

You will likely need two to three coats of paint for full, even coverage. The exact number depends on the paint color and the original color of your cube storage. For instance, if you are tackling [how to paint ikea cabinets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-paint-ikea-cabinets), which are often laminate, you might need more coats. Be patient and take your time. This step defines the final appearance of your transformed cube storage.

### 6. Sealing and Protecting Your Painted Cube Storage

Once your final paint coat is completely dry, it is time to protect your work. A protective topcoat, or sealer, adds durability and longevity to your painted cube storage. It shields against scratches, chips, and daily wear and tear. This is especially important for furniture that sees regular use.

Choose a clear topcoat that is compatible with your paint. **Polycrylic** is a popular choice for painted furniture. It is water-based, dries clear, and resists yellowing. It works well over lighter paint colors. **Polyurethane** is another option, but oil-based polyurethane can yellow over time, making it less ideal for white or light-colored furniture. Water-based polyurethane is also available and dries clear. Consider the finish: matte, satin, semi-gloss, or gloss. Satin is often preferred for furniture as it offers a subtle sheen without being too reflective.

**Apply the topcoat in thin, even layers.** Use a clean brush or a foam roller. Just like with paint, multiple thin coats are better than one thick one. Thick coats can create streaks, bubbles, or a cloudy finish. Work in a well-ventilated area.

Allow each coat to dry fully according to the manufacturer's instructions. This might take a few hours between coats. You can lightly sand with 220-grit or finer sandpaper between topcoats if desired. This creates an ultra-smooth finish. Wipe away any dust before applying the next coat. I usually apply two to three coats of polycrylic for good protection.

After applying the final topcoat, **allow it to cure fully**. This can take several days or even a week, depending on the product. During this curing period, handle the cube storage carefully. Avoid placing heavy objects on it or wiping it aggressively. Once cured, your painted cube storage will be durable and ready for use. This final step secures all your hard work.

### 7. Troubleshooting Common Painting Problems

Even with careful planning, painting problems can occur. Knowing how to fix them saves time and frustration. I have encountered most of these issues myself. Here are common problems and their solutions.

**Drips and Runs:** These happen when you apply too much paint at once. If the paint is still wet, gently smooth it out with your brush or roller. If it is dry, carefully sand down the drip with fine-grit sandpaper (220-grit or higher). Then, repaint the area with thin coats. Prevention is best: apply thinner coats.

**Uneven Finish or Patchiness:** This often means insufficient primer or paint coats. It can also result from improper surface preparation. Ensure you clean and sand thoroughly before priming. Apply a second or third coat of primer if needed. Then, apply more thin coats of paint until the coverage is even. Remember to let each coat dry completely.

**Poor Adhesion (Paint Peeling or Scratching Off Easily):** This is usually due to inadequate surface preparation or using the wrong primer. If your cube storage is laminate or very glossy, a bonding primer is essential. If paint is peeling, you might need to sand down the affected area completely. Then re-prime and repaint. Ensure the surface is clean and slightly scuffed before priming.

**Bubbles in the Paint:** Bubbles can form from shaking the paint can too vigorously or applying paint too quickly. To fix, pop the bubbles while the paint is wet. If dry, sand them down lightly and apply another thin coat. Rollers with too long a nap can also cause bubbles; use a foam roller for a smoother finish.

**Visible Brush Strokes:** This indicates either using too much paint, using the wrong type of brush, or not laying off the paint properly. Use a good quality synthetic brush and apply thin coats. For large flat areas, a foam roller often gives a smoother finish than a brush. You can lightly sand dried strokes and apply another thin coat.

**Dust or Debris on Wet Paint:** This happens if your painting area is not clean. Before painting, clean the area thoroughly. If dust lands on wet paint, let the paint dry. Then, gently sand the dust bump off with fine-grit sandpaper. Wipe clean and apply another thin coat.

Addressing these issues ensures a professional-looking result. Patience and attention to detail are your best tools.

### FAQ Section

#### Q1: Can I paint any type of cube storage, including laminate or particle board?

Yes, you can paint most types of cube storage, including laminate and particle board. The key is proper preparation and using the right products. You must scuff the surface with sandpaper and apply a high-quality bonding primer. This ensures the paint adheres well to slick or porous materials. Without these steps, the paint may peel or chip easily.

#### Q2: What is the best type of paint for cube storage?

For cube storage, a durable, all-in-one furniture paint or a good quality latex or acrylic enamel paint works best. Latex and acrylic paints are water-based, easy to clean up, and dry relatively quickly. Choose a paint with a satin or semi-gloss finish for added durability. For high-traffic areas, ensure the paint is specifically designed for furniture.

#### Q3: Do I really need to sand and prime my cube storage before painting?

Yes, sanding and priming are crucial steps for a successful paint job. Sanding creates a "tooth" on the surface, allowing the primer to grip better, especially on smooth or glossy materials like laminate. Primer seals the surface, prevents stains from bleeding through, and ensures an even color. Skipping these steps often leads to poor paint adhesion and a less durable finish.

#### Q4: How long does it take for painted cube storage to dry and cure?

Drying time between coats is typically 2-4 hours, but always check the paint can's instructions. Full cure time, when the paint reaches its maximum hardness and durability, can take much longer, often 7-30 days. During the curing period, handle the unit carefully. Avoid heavy use or placing objects on the surface that might stick or scratch the new paint.

#### Q5: Can I paint the inside of the cubbies?

Yes, you can paint the inside of the cubbies for a complete, cohesive look. Use the same preparation and painting steps as the exterior. If you only want to paint the outside, use painter's tape to protect the inside edges. Painting the inside can add a pop of contrasting color or simply create a more finished appearance.

#### Q6: How do I clean my painted cube storage after it's finished?

Once the paint and topcoat are fully cured, clean your painted cube storage with a soft, damp cloth. Use a mild, non-abrasive cleaner if needed. Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive scrubbers, or excessive water, as these can damage the paint finish. Regular, gentle cleaning will help maintain its fresh look for years.
