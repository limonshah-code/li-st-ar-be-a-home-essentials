## How to Wash Throw Pillows: Your Complete Guide to Freshness

Throw pillows add comfort and style to any room. They make our sofas and beds feel cozy. Over time, however, these decorative items collect dust, dirt, and spills. Learning how to properly wash a throw pillow ensures they stay clean and extend their life. Keeping them fresh also improves your home's hygiene.

This guide will walk you through every step. We will cover checking care labels, washing different materials, and drying your pillows. You will learn easy methods to keep your throw pillows looking their best. Let's make your home a cleaner, happier place.

### Takeaway

*   Always check the care label on your throw pillow or its cover before washing.
*   Separate removable covers from inserts for different washing methods.
*   Machine wash most covers on a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent.
*   Hand wash delicate covers or spot clean non-washable inserts.
*   Dry pillow covers and inserts thoroughly to prevent mildew and maintain shape.

### Quick Answer

To wash a throw pillow, first check its care label. If washable, separate the cover and insert. Machine wash covers on a delicate cycle with cold water. Hand wash or spot clean inserts if not machine washable. Air dry or tumble dry on low, ensuring complete dryness to avoid mold.

### Before You Begin: Check the Care Label

Starting your throw pillow cleaning journey begins with one very important step: checking the care label. This tiny tag holds all the vital information you need. It tells you exactly how to wash a throw pillow safely. Ignoring this label can result in damage to your beloved decorations.

I always recommend finding that small tag first. It usually sits along a seam of the pillow or its cover. These labels use symbols and sometimes text to guide you. They specify if the item is machine washable, hand wash only, or dry clean only. Understanding these symbols prevents shrinking, fading, or ruining the fabric.

Different fabrics require different care. A cotton cover will withstand machine washing much better than a silk or wool one. The label also tells you about water temperature and drying instructions. Following these guidelines ensures your pillow remains beautiful for years. It protects your investment and saves you from cleaning mishaps.

If your throw pillow has a removable cover, check both the cover and the insert for separate care instructions. Sometimes, the cover is washable, but the insert is not. This distinction is very important for proper cleaning. Taking this step helps you know if you can actually [wash throw pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-throw-pillows) or if they need special care. Always prioritize the care label's advice for the best results.

### Separate Covers and Inserts for Easy Cleaning

Many throw pillows come with covers that you can remove. This design makes cleaning much simpler and more effective. When you separate the cover from the insert, you can treat each part according to its specific needs. This approach prevents damage to delicate fabrics or sensitive fillings. It is a crucial step for maintaining your pillow's condition.

Pillow covers often tolerate machine washing. They are typically made from durable fabrics like cotton, linen, or synthetic blends. The inserts, however, may contain materials like down, feathers, foam, or polyester fill. These fillings often require different care methods. Washing them together can lead to lumps, damage, or improper drying.

Think of it like this: a shirt and its delicate lining need different washing methods. The same applies to throw pillow covers and inserts. By separating them, you ensure that each component receives the most appropriate treatment. This method extends the life of both the cover and the filling. It also helps in achieving a deeper, more hygienic clean.

If your pillow cover is made of cotton, it is often quite robust. You might find that [you can wash a cotton pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-a-cotton-pillow) cover directly in your washing machine. Always check the label, but generally, cotton handles water well. This separation strategy ensures you do not subject a foam insert to a cycle meant for a sturdy cotton cover. Keep them apart for the best washing experience.

### Machine Washing Throw Pillow Covers Safely

Most throw pillow covers are machine washable. This makes cleaning them incredibly convenient. Before you toss them in, a little preparation goes a long way. This ensures they come out looking fresh and clean, not damaged or faded. I always start by checking for any visible stains.

For stains, a quick pre-treatment can work wonders. Apply a small amount of stain remover directly to the soiled area. Let it sit for a few minutes, following the product's instructions. This helps lift dirt and spills before the main wash cycle. This step is especially helpful for coffee spills or dirt marks.

Next, turn your pillow covers inside out. This protects the fabric's outer surface and any embellishments during the wash. Zip up any zippers or fasten any buttons. This prevents them from snagging on other items or getting damaged. Place the covers in the washing machine.

Use a mild detergent and set your machine to a delicate or gentle cycle. Cold water is usually best for most fabrics. It helps prevent shrinking and color fading. Avoid harsh detergents or bleach, which can harm the fabric or dyes. Washing covers this way is similar to [how to wash a pillow in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-pillow-in-the-washing-machine) for a standard sleeping pillow. This method keeps your decorative covers in top condition.

### Hand Washing Delicate Throw Pillow Covers

Sometimes, machine washing is not an option for your throw pillow covers. Certain materials and embellishments require a gentler touch. Delicate fabrics like silk, wool, velvet, or those with beads, sequins, or intricate embroidery fall into this category. Hand washing prevents damage to these fragile items. It ensures they maintain their shape and special details.

I find hand washing is a mindful process. You have complete control over the water temperature and agitation. Start by filling a clean basin or tub with cool or lukewarm water. Add a small amount of mild, gentle detergent. Choose one specifically designed for delicate fabrics. Swirl the water to create some suds.

Submerge the pillow cover completely in the soapy water. Gently swish it around, allowing the water and detergent to work through the fabric. Do not scrub or wring aggressively, as this can stretch or damage the material. Pay special attention to any soiled areas, gently rubbing them with your fingers. Let the cover soak for about 10-15 minutes.

After soaking, drain the soapy water. Refill the basin with clean, cool water. Rinse the cover thoroughly, pressing it gently to remove all soap residue. Change the water several times until the water runs clear. This careful method ensures your delicate covers are clean without causing any harm.

### Cleaning Throw Pillow Inserts: A Step-by-Step Guide

Cleaning the inserts of your throw pillows requires different considerations than covers. The type of filling determines the best cleaning method. Most synthetic inserts, like polyester fiberfill, are often machine washable. Down or feather inserts can also sometimes go into the washer. Memory foam and other foam inserts typically need spot cleaning.

For machine-washable synthetic or down inserts, place them in the washing machine. Wash one or two inserts at a time to ensure even cleaning. Use a mild detergent and select a gentle cycle with cold or lukewarm water. Adding a few tennis balls to the wash can help fluff the inserts. This prevents them from clumping.

If you have a memory foam throw pillow insert, avoid submerging it in water. Water can break down the foam structure and lead to mildew. Instead, focus on spot cleaning. Mix a small amount of mild detergent with water to create a cleaning solution. Dampen a clean cloth with this solution and gently dab the soiled area. Press firmly but do not rub. Rinse the cloth and wipe the area again to remove soap residue.

For buckwheat or other natural fill inserts, usually the fill is removed and the casing washed, or the entire pillow is spot cleaned. It's important to remember that some specialty fillings, like [memory foam pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-memory-foam-pillow), have unique care instructions. Always check the label on your specific insert for the best advice. Proper cleaning of inserts ensures your pillows stay supportive and fresh.

### Effective Drying Methods for Throw Pillows

Drying your throw pillows correctly is as important as washing them. Improper drying can lead to mildew, odor, or damaged fill. The goal is to remove all moisture completely. This preserves the pillow's shape, fluffiness, and hygiene. I always emphasize thorough drying to my friends and family.

For pillow covers, air drying is often the safest and gentlest method. Hang them on a clothesline or lay them flat on a clean, dry surface. Direct sunlight can help speed up drying and act as a natural sanitizer. However, avoid excessive direct sun exposure for brightly colored covers, as it can cause fading. Ensure good air circulation around the covers.

When drying pillow inserts, especially synthetic or down-filled ones, a dryer can be very effective. Use a low heat or air-fluff setting. High heat can melt synthetic fibers or damage delicate down feathers. To help fluff the inserts and prevent clumping, add a few dryer balls or clean tennis balls to the dryer. These items gently beat the pillow, distributing the fill evenly.

It is crucial to dry inserts completely. This may take several cycles, especially for thicker pillows. Take them out periodically and fluff them by hand. Feel for any damp spots, especially in the center. Any remaining moisture can lead to mildew, which is difficult to remove. Air dry memory foam inserts flat, away from direct sunlight, and ensure they are fully dry before placing them back in their covers. Patience during drying prevents future problems.

### Spot Cleaning and Refreshing Your Throw Pillows

Sometimes your throw pillows do not need a full wash. For small spills, minor dirt, or just to freshen them up, spot cleaning is a great solution. This method saves time and reduces wear and tear from frequent washing. It helps keep your pillows looking good between deeper cleans. I often rely on spot cleaning for quick fixes.

To spot clean, first identify the type of stain. For liquid spills, blot the area immediately with a clean, dry cloth. Do not rub, as this can push the stain deeper into the fabric. For solid messes, gently scrape off any excess material before cleaning. This prepares the area for treatment.

Next, create a gentle cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of mild detergent, like dish soap or laundry detergent, with water. You can also use a specialized fabric spot cleaner. Apply the solution to a clean cloth, not directly onto the pillow. Gently dab the stained area with the damp cloth. Work from the outside of the stain inwards to prevent spreading.

Once the stain lifts, use a fresh, damp cloth with plain water to wipe away any soap residue. Then, blot the area dry with a clean, dry towel. Allow the pillow to air dry completely. For refreshing pillows that just need a boost, sprinkle baking soda over the surface. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then vacuum it off. This helps absorb odors and leaves your pillows smelling fresh.

### FAQ Section

#### How often should I wash throw pillows?
You should wash throw pillows every 3-6 months, depending on use. Pillows used daily, especially by pets or children, may need more frequent cleaning. Less used decorative pillows might only need washing once or twice a year. Always check care labels for specific recommendations.

#### Can all throw pillows go in the washing machine?
No, not all throw pillows are machine washable. Always check the care label on both the cover and the insert. Delicate fabrics like silk or wool, or pillows with embellishments, usually require hand washing or spot cleaning. Foam inserts are typically not machine washable.

#### What if my throw pillow doesn't have a care label?
If your throw pillow lacks a care label, it's safer to hand wash or spot clean. Assume the most delicate cleaning method. If you are unsure of the fabric, test a small, inconspicuous area with your cleaning solution first. You can also try to identify the fabric type by touch.

#### How do I remove stubborn stains from throw pillows?
For stubborn stains, pre-treat the area with a suitable stain remover before washing. Apply it directly to the stain and let it sit for a few minutes. For oil-based stains, sprinkle cornstarch or baking soda to absorb the oil first. Gently blot and repeat if necessary.

#### Can I wash a throw pillow with a non-removable cover?
Yes, you can wash a throw pillow with a non-removable cover. If the entire pillow is machine washable according to its label, wash it whole on a gentle cycle. For delicate or non-washable pillows, spot clean the entire pillow carefully. Ensure thorough drying to prevent mildew.

#### How to dry throw pillows without a dryer?
To dry throw pillows without a dryer, air dry them completely. Place them on a clean, flat surface or hang them, ensuring good air circulation. Rotate them periodically to expose all sides to the air. You can also use a fan or dehumidifier to speed up the drying process.
