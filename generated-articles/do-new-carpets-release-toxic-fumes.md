### The Science Behind New Carpet Off-Gassing

You have just installed new carpet. You notice a distinct smell. This aroma comes from a process called off-gassing. Off-gassing means the release of chemicals into the air. Many products in our homes off-gas, including furniture, paints, and building materials. Carpets are no different. They contain various compounds that can become airborne.

The "new carpet smell" is primarily due to Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOCs. These are carbon-containing chemicals. They readily vaporize at room temperature. Many different VOCs exist. Some are harmless, but others can cause health problems. The manufacturing process uses these chemicals. They are present in carpet fibers, backings, and adhesives. When carpet is new, these chemicals escape into your indoor environment.

The intensity of off-gassing usually lessens over time. It is strongest immediately after installation. Levels decrease significantly within the first few days or weeks. However, some VOCs can continue to off-gas for months or even years at lower concentrations. The rate depends on the specific chemicals and environmental conditions. Warm temperatures and high humidity can increase off-gassing. Understanding this process helps us take steps to reduce exposure. We want to keep our homes healthy and safe.
