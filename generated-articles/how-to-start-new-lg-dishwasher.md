## Get Your New LG Dishwasher Running Smoothly

Unpacking a new LG dishwasher feels exciting. You want to start washing dishes right away. This guide helps you set up and use your new LG dishwasher for the first time. We cover everything from initial checks to selecting wash cycles. You will learn how to **start your new LG dishwasher** without trouble. We also share tips for optimal performance and easy troubleshooting.

### Takeaway

Starting your new LG dishwasher requires a few simple steps. Ensure proper installation, load it correctly, and select a cycle.
*   Check the power and water connections first.
*   Load dishes according to LG guidelines.
*   Choose a suitable wash cycle and options.
*   Press the Start button to begin the cycle.
*   Address any error codes or issues quickly.

To start your new LG dishwasher, ensure it has power and water. Load the dishes properly. Add detergent and rinse aid. Close the door firmly. Select your desired wash cycle and any options. Then, press the Start button. The dishwasher will begin its cleaning cycle.

## Preparing Your New LG Dishwasher for Its First Wash

Setting up your new LG dishwasher correctly ensures great performance from day one. You need to complete a few simple steps before running the first wash. Proper preparation prevents future problems. This initial check makes sure your appliance is ready to work.

First, confirm the dishwasher is installed correctly. This means proper water supply, drain connection, and electrical power. Check for any leaks around the water inlet and drain hoses. Leaks can cause water damage. You want a secure and dry installation area.

Next, remove all packing materials from inside the dishwasher. This includes any foam, plastic, or tape. Sometimes, manufacturers place items inside for transport. Running the dishwasher with these materials inside can cause damage. Look at the racks, spray arms, and filter area carefully.

After removing packing materials, check the detergent and rinse aid dispensers. These are usually empty when new. You will add detergent and rinse aid before the first wash. This helps with cleaning and drying performance. A full rinse aid dispenser prevents water spots.

Finally, ensure the dishwasher door closes and latches securely. A loose door prevents the dishwasher from starting. It also causes water to leak during operation. Listen for a click when you close the door. This confirms the latch is engaged. Proper preparation makes starting your new LG dishwasher easy and worry-free.

## Understanding Your LG Dishwasher Control Panel

Your LG dishwasher control panel holds the key to its functions. Different LG models have different control layouts. Some models feature a front-facing panel. Other models use a hidden top control panel. Both types offer clear options for starting a cycle.

Front control panels show all buttons and displays on the front of the door. You can see the cycle selections and time remaining at a glance. Buttons are often clearly labeled for cycles like "Normal," "Heavy," or "Auto." Options like "High Temp" or "Sanitize" also have dedicated buttons. This design offers straightforward operation.

Top control panels sit on the top edge of the dishwasher door. These controls become visible only when you open the door. When the door is closed, the control panel is hidden. This creates a sleek, clean look in your kitchen. Many users find this design appealing. You select your cycle and options before closing the door. Once the door is closed, the cycle starts or waits for a final button press. Understanding how to use the specific controls on your LG model is important. If you have a top control model, it operates slightly differently than a front control model. Learn more about operating these types of models with guides like [How to Start LG Dishwasher Top Control](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-start-lg-dishwasher-top-control).

On either panel type, you will find a "Power" button. This button turns the dishwasher on and off. You will also see a "Start" or "Start/Pause" button. This button begins the wash cycle. Some models feature a "Delay Start" option. This lets you set the dishwasher to run at a later time. Always consult your specific LG dishwasher manual for detailed control panel information. Each model may have unique features.

## Loading Dishes for Optimal Cleaning

Loading your LG dishwasher correctly is important for clean dishes. Poor loading can block water spray. This leaves food residue on dishes. Proper loading also protects your dishes from damage. Follow a few simple rules for best results.

Place larger items like plates and serving dishes on the bottom rack. Face the dirty surfaces towards the center spray arm. This ensures they get full water coverage. Do not overcrowd the bottom rack. Overlapping dishes prevent water and detergent from reaching all surfaces.

Put glasses, cups, and bowls on the top rack. Place them upside down to prevent water from collecting. Angle bowls slightly so water drains properly. Do not let tall items block the upper spray arm. The upper spray arm needs to spin freely. This helps clean all items on the top rack.

Arrange silverware in the designated basket. Place forks and spoons with handles down. This exposes the eating surfaces to water. Knives should face handles up for safety. Some LG models have a third rack for small items or cutlery. Use this rack for items like spatulas or long knives. Ensure nothing blocks the spray arm movement from the top.

Always scrape large food particles from dishes before loading. This prevents the dishwasher filter from clogging. It also improves cleaning efficiency. Do not pre-rinse dishes unless heavily soiled. Modern detergents work best when they can cling to some food particles. Correct loading is a simple step that makes a big difference in how well your new LG dishwasher cleans.

## Selecting the Right Wash Cycle and Options

Choosing the right wash cycle is key to getting clean dishes. Your new LG dishwasher offers various cycles and options. Each one is designed for different types of loads. Understanding these choices helps you save energy and achieve the best cleaning results.

Most LG dishwashers include a "Normal" cycle. This is for everyday loads with average soil. It balances cleaning power and energy use. For heavily soiled pots and pans, select the "Heavy" cycle. This cycle uses more water and longer wash times. It helps remove stubborn, baked-on food.

The "Auto" cycle is a smart option. It uses sensors to detect how dirty your dishes are. Then, it adjusts the wash time and water temperature automatically. This saves energy for lighter loads. Use "Auto" if you are unsure which cycle to pick.

Many LG models also feature specialized options. "High Temp" or "Sanitize" cycles use extra hot water. These cycles kill bacteria and germs. They are great for baby bottles or cutting boards. The "Dry Boost" or "Extra Dry" option adds more heat during the drying phase. This helps ensure dishes are completely dry. If you only have a few items, consider the "Half Load" option. This option uses less water and energy for smaller loads.

Before pressing start, add the correct amount of detergent to the dispenser. Always use dishwasher-specific detergent. Add rinse aid to its dispenser. Rinse aid helps dishes dry without spots. After selecting your cycle and options, close the door firmly. Press the "Start" button. Your LG dishwasher will begin its cleaning process.

## The Important First Wash Cycle

Running the first wash cycle on your new LG dishwasher is a crucial step. This initial run helps flush out any manufacturing residues. It also tests the installation and proper function of the appliance. You should always run a test cycle before washing dishes.

For this first wash, do not load any dishes. Run the dishwasher empty. Add a small amount of dishwasher detergent to the dispenser. You can also add some dishwasher cleaner, if you prefer. This helps clean the internal components. It removes any dust or oils from the factory.

Select the "Normal" or "Auto" cycle for this first wash. These cycles provide a thorough cleaning of the interior. Press the "Start" button to begin the cycle. Listen for the sound of water filling and the pump running. This confirms the water supply and drainage are working correctly.

During the cycle, check for any leaks. Look under the sink and around the base of the dishwasher. Spotting leaks early prevents water damage to your floor or cabinets. It also confirms your installation is solid. If you see any water, stop the cycle immediately and address the leak.

Once the cycle finishes, open the door carefully. The interior should look clean and smell fresh. This confirms your new LG dishwasher is ready for daily use. This first empty wash sets the stage for efficient and trouble-free dishwashing. It ensures your appliance is primed for excellent performance.

## Troubleshooting Common Starting Issues with Your LG Dishwasher

Sometimes, your new LG dishwasher might not start as expected. This can be frustrating, but many issues have simple solutions. Most starting problems relate to power, the door, or control settings. Checking these common areas helps you get your dishwasher running quickly.

First, check the power supply. Ensure the dishwasher is plugged into a live outlet. Look at your home's circuit breaker box. A tripped breaker will cut power to the dishwasher. Reset the breaker if it is off. Sometimes, the power button on the dishwasher itself needs to be pressed firmly.

Next, examine the door latch. The dishwasher door must close completely and latch securely. If the door is not fully closed, the dishwasher will not start. Push the door firmly until you hear a click. This confirms the latch engaged. If the latch is broken, it may need repair. You might find issues with the start button itself. If your LG dishwasher has a specific problem with its start button, you might need to try alternative methods, as described in guides like [How to Start LG Dishwasher Without Start Button](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-start-lg-dishwasher-without-start-button).

Check if the "Control Lock" or "Child Lock" feature is active. Many LG dishwashers have this safety feature. It prevents accidental starting or changes to settings. Look for a lock icon on your control panel. Press and hold the designated button for a few seconds to deactivate it. The method to unlock varies by model. Refer to your owner's manual for specific instructions.

Finally, verify the water supply. Ensure the water valve connected to the dishwasher is fully open. A closed or partially closed valve prevents water from entering. This stops the wash cycle from beginning. If these steps do not solve the problem, consult your LG owner's manual or contact LG customer support. They can offer more specific troubleshooting advice for your model.

## Maintaining Your New LG Dishwasher for Longevity

Regular maintenance helps your new LG dishwasher perform its best. It also extends the life of your appliance. Simple, routine checks prevent common issues. A well-maintained dishwasher cleans dishes more effectively.

Clean the dishwasher filter regularly. Food particles and grease can clog the filter. This reduces cleaning performance and causes odors. Remove the filter, rinse it under running water, and scrub gently with a brush. Most LG filters twist out easily. Clean the spray arms too. Check for clogged holes in the spray arms. Use a toothpick to clear any blockages. This ensures proper water distribution.

Run a dishwasher cleaning cycle once a month. Use a dishwasher cleaner or a cup of white vinegar. Place the cleaner or vinegar in an empty dishwasher. Run a hot cycle, like "Heavy" or "Sanitize." This helps remove mineral buildup and odors from inside the tub.

Wipe down the door gasket and surrounding areas. Food debris or grime can build up around the door seal. This can lead to mold or mildew. Use a damp cloth to clean the gasket. A clean gasket ensures a tight seal. A tight seal prevents leaks.

Refill the rinse aid dispenser when the indicator light appears. Rinse aid helps dishes dry spot-free. It also assists in the drying process. Check the salt dispenser if your model has a water softener. Keep it filled with dishwasher salt for optimal water softening. Following these maintenance tips keeps your new LG dishwasher running efficiently for many years.
