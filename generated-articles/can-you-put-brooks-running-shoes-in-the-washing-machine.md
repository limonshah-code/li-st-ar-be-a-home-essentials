Place the shoes in a mesh laundry bag to protect them. Air dry completely afterward. This method helps maintain shoe integrity while getting them clean.

### Understanding Your Brooks Running Shoes: Materials and Construction

Brooks running shoes are known for their advanced technology and comfortable design. They use a variety of materials. These materials are chosen for their performance characteristics. Understanding these components helps you clean your shoes effectively and safely.

The upper part of most Brooks shoes features engineered mesh. This mesh provides breathability and flexibility. It conforms to your foot shape. The midsole often contains proprietary foam, like DNA LOFT or BioMoGo DNA. This foam offers cushioning and responsiveness. The outsole is typically made of durable rubber compounds. These compounds provide traction and resist wear.

The glues and adhesives holding these parts together are also important. These bonding agents can be sensitive to heat. High temperatures can weaken them. This can cause parts of your shoes to separate or deform. Machine washing, when done incorrectly, poses risks to these materials. Harsh detergents can break down fibers. High spin cycles can stress seams and connections. My goal is always to preserve the shoe's structure.

I want my Brooks shoes to last many miles. Proper cleaning helps achieve this. It maintains the integrity of the mesh, foam, and rubber. It also keeps the critical bonding intact. This section has given us a solid foundation. Now we can move on to specific cleaning steps. We will ensure your shoes remain in excellent condition.

### Preparing Your Brooks Running Shoes for the Wash Cycle

Before your Brooks running shoes go near a washing machine, careful preparation is essential. This step greatly influences the outcome. Skipping preparation can lead to damaged shoes or ineffective cleaning. I always spend time on this stage. It ensures my shoes come out looking their best.

#### Removing Laces and Inserts for a Thorough Clean

First, I always remove the shoelaces. Laces can tangle during the wash cycle. This can damage both the laces and the shoes. They can also prevent the wash water from reaching all parts of the shoe. I also take out the insoles (or sockliners). Insoles often absorb sweat and odor directly. Washing them separately allows for a more thorough clean. You can wash laces in the same mesh bag as the shoes. Insoles are generally better washed by hand. A gentle scrub with soap and water works well. This prevents them from getting damaged or losing their shape in the machine.

#### Knocking Off Loose Dirt and Debris

Next, I tackle any loose dirt. My running shoes often collect mud, dust, and small stones. I take them outside and gently tap the soles together. This removes most of the caked-on mud. A stiff brush, like an old toothbrush or a dedicated shoe brush, can help. I use it to brush off dirt from the upper and the outsole. This pre-cleaning step prevents dirt from spreading in the washing machine. It also makes the machine's job easier. It ensures a cleaner result.

#### Pre-Treating Stubborn Stains Effectively

Finally, I look for any stubborn stains. Grass stains, oil marks, or dark scuffs often need extra attention. I pre-treat these spots with a mild stain remover. A small amount of laundry detergent diluted in water also works. I apply it directly to the stain. Then, I gently rub it with a soft brush or cloth. I let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. This allows the cleaner to break down the stain. This step is crucial. It increases the chances of removing tough marks during the wash. Always test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area first. This prevents discoloration or damage.

By taking these preparatory steps, I set my Brooks running shoes up for success. They enter the washing machine in the best possible state. This maximizes cleaning effectiveness and minimizes risks. It also protects my washing machine from excessive dirt.

### Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings for Brooks Shoes

The washing machine settings you choose are critical for cleaning Brooks running shoes safely. Incorrect settings can cause irreversible damage. They can ruin the cushioning, distort the shape, or weaken the adhesives. I always pay close attention to these details. I want my shoes to maintain their structure and support.

#### Cold Water is Key: Protecting Shoe Materials

My first rule is always to use cold water. Hot water is the enemy of athletic shoes. It can cause materials to shrink. It can also melt or weaken the glues holding the shoe components together. This includes the adhesive that bonds the outsole to the midsole. Cold water is gentle. It effectively removes dirt and odors without compromising the shoe's integrity. It helps preserve the vibrant colors of your Brooks shoes. It also keeps the foam cushioning from degrading prematurely.

#### Gentle or Delicate Cycle: Minimizing Stress and Damage

Next, I select the gentlest cycle available on my washing machine. This is usually the "delicate" or "hand wash" cycle. Some machines might have a "sports wear" or "athletic shoes" setting. These cycles use slower agitation and a lower spin speed. This minimizes stress on the shoes. High-speed cycles can twist and bang shoes against the drum. This can cause the mesh to tear or the sole to come loose. A gentle cycle ensures a smooth wash. It protects the shape and stitching of your Brooks running shoes. For guidance on different machine settings, you might find this article helpful: [Which Washing Machine Mode for Shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/which-washing-machine-mode-for-shoes).

#### Mild Detergent Only: Avoiding Harsh Chemicals

I use only a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent. Harsh detergents can be too abrasive for shoe materials. Powdered detergents can leave a residue. This residue can be difficult to rinse out. It can also irritate your feet. I avoid detergents with strong bleaches or fabric softeners. Bleach can cause discoloration and break down fibers. Fabric softener can clog the breathable mesh. It can also affect the wicking properties of the shoe's lining. A small amount of gentle liquid detergent is all you need. It effectively cleans without causing harm.

By following these specific settings, I ensure my Brooks running shoes get a thorough clean. They remain protected from the potential harshness of a washing machine. This careful approach helps extend their life. It also keeps them ready for my next run.

### The Best Way to Wash Brooks Running Shoes in a Machine

Now that your Brooks running shoes are prepped, and you understand the right settings, it's time for the actual wash. This process needs a few more careful steps. These steps ensure maximum protection for your shoes and your washing machine. I follow these steps precisely every time. This guarantees a safe and effective clean for my athletic footwear.

#### Using a Mesh Laundry Bag for Protection

Before placing the shoes in the machine, I put each shoe into its own mesh laundry bag. If you only have one large bag, you can put both shoes in it. The bag acts as a protective barrier. It prevents the shoes from banging against the washing machine drum. This reduces the risk of damage. It also keeps laces (if you wash them in the bag) from tangling around other items or parts of the machine. The mesh material allows water and detergent to flow through easily. This ensures a proper clean. This simple tool is inexpensive and essential for machine-washing shoes.

#### Adding Old Towels to Balance the Load

I always add a few old towels to the washing machine with my shoes. These towels serve two main purposes. First, they help balance the load. Shoes can be heavy and uneven. This can cause the washing machine to vibrate excessively. Towels absorb some of this impact. Second, the towels provide cushioning. They protect both your shoes and the machine's drum from impact. I choose towels I don't mind getting dirty. They can pick up some of the grime from the shoes. Three to four medium-sized towels are usually enough.

#### Step-by-Step Washing Process

1.  **Load the Machine:** Place the mesh bag(s) with your Brooks shoes inside the washing machine. Add the old towels around the shoes.
2.  **Add Detergent:** Pour a small amount of mild liquid detergent into the dispenser. Remember, less is more.
3.  **Select Cycle:** Choose the cold water, delicate, or hand wash cycle. Ensure the spin speed is set to low.
4.  **Start Wash:** Begin the washing cycle. Let the machine do its work gently.
5.  **Monitor:** I sometimes check the machine during the first few minutes. This ensures everything is running smoothly. There should be no excessive banging or imbalance.

Once the cycle finishes, I remove the shoes promptly. I take them out of the mesh bags. They might still feel quite wet. This is normal. The next step, drying, is just as important. For more general guidance on washing shoes, you can refer to [How to Machine Wash Shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-machine-wash-shoes). This detailed process ensures my Brooks running shoes come out clean. They are ready for proper drying.

### Drying Your Brooks Running Shoes Safely After Washing

After a successful wash cycle, the drying phase is paramount. This step is where many people make mistakes. Improper drying can cause shrinkage, material breakdown, and foul odors. It can undo all your careful washing efforts. I am very particular about how I dry my running shoes. This ensures they maintain their shape, fit, and performance.

#### Air Drying is the Only Way: Avoid Machine Dryers

My strongest advice is never, ever to put your Brooks running shoes in a tumble dryer. The heat from a dryer is incredibly damaging. It will shrink materials, especially the mesh uppers. It can also melt the glues and adhesives that hold the shoe together. This can cause soles to detach or deform. High heat can also degrade the cushioning foam. This reduces the shoe's shock absorption and comfort. Air drying is the only safe method. It preserves the structural integrity of your expensive running shoes.

#### Stuffing for Shape Retention and Faster Drying

Once the shoes are out of the washing machine, they will be damp. I immediately stuff them with clean, dry paper towels or newspaper. This helps absorb excess moisture from inside the shoe. It also helps the shoes retain their original shape as they dry. Newspaper works well because it is absorbent. Just be aware that ink can sometimes transfer to very light-colored linings. If you have white shoes, stick with plain white paper towels. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes saturated. This speeds up the drying process.

#### Choosing the Right Drying Spot for Optimal Results

I place my stuffed shoes in a well-ventilated area. This is crucial for efficient drying. A spot with good airflow helps moisture evaporate quickly. I avoid direct sunlight, as strong UV rays can fade colors. They can also degrade certain materials over time. I never place shoes directly on a heat vent or radiator. This mimics the harmful heat of a dryer. An outdoor porch on a breezy day, or an indoor spot near an open window, works perfectly. I often place them on a shoe rack or hang them by the laces. This allows air to circulate around all sides.

Drying can take 24 to 48 hours, sometimes longer. It depends on humidity and shoe thickness. It is important that the shoes are completely dry before you wear them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to blisters. It also encourages bacterial growth and unpleasant odors. Patience is key here. Your Brooks running shoes will thank you for it.

### When Hand Washing Is a Better Option for Brooks Shoes

While machine washing can be convenient, it is not always the best choice for every situation or every pair of Brooks running shoes. There are times when hand washing is a superior and safer method. I often opt for hand washing myself, especially for specific cleaning needs. It gives me more control.

#### For Light Cleaning and Spot Treatment

Sometimes, my shoes only have a small mud splatter or a faint stain. For these light cleaning needs, a full machine wash is overkill. Hand washing allows me to target specific areas. I can use a damp cloth or a soft brush. I apply a small amount of mild soap or diluted detergent. This method saves time and water. It also puts less stress on the entire shoe. It is perfect for a quick refresh without a deep clean. This approach is gentle on the shoe's materials.

#### For Very Delicate Materials or Older Models

Some Brooks running shoes might feature more delicate materials. This includes specific types of knit uppers or reflective elements. Older pairs, where the adhesives might be less robust, also benefit from hand washing. A machine wash can be too aggressive for these shoes. It can cause stretching, tearing, or detachment of components. Hand washing provides a controlled environment. I can assess the material's reaction to water and soap in real-time. This helps prevent accidental damage. It is a gentler approach for precious or fragile footwear.

#### To Extend Shoe Lifespan and Maintain Integrity

Frequent machine washing, even on a delicate cycle, can still contribute to wear and tear over time. Hand washing is less abrasive. It reduces the mechanical stress on seams, stitching, and cushioning. By choosing hand washing when appropriate, I believe I extend the lifespan of my Brooks running shoes. This method helps maintain their original shape and structural integrity for longer. It keeps them performing at their best for more miles.

To hand wash effectively, I gather warm water, mild soap, and a soft brush. I remove laces and insoles first. Then, I dip the brush in soapy water and gently scrub the shoes. I pay attention to dirty areas. After scrubbing, I rinse the shoes with clean, cool water. I use a damp cloth to wipe away all soap residue. Finally, I air dry them as described previously. This careful process ensures a clean shoe without the risks of machine washing.

### Maintaining Your Brooks Running Shoes Between Washes

Washing your Brooks running shoes thoroughly is important. However, regular maintenance between washes is equally critical. These habits can significantly extend the life of your shoes. They also keep them looking and smelling fresher for longer. I incorporate these simple steps into my routine. This reduces the need for frequent deep cleaning. It saves time and preserves my footwear.

#### Regular Brushing and Spot Cleaning

After each run, or at least once a week, I quickly brush off my shoes. I use a soft brush or an old toothbrush. This removes loose dirt, dust, and dried mud from the upper and outsole. This prevents dirt from becoming ingrained in the fabric. If I notice a small scuff or stain, I spot clean it immediately. A damp cloth with a tiny bit of mild soap can work wonders. This prevents small blemishes from becoming major stains. Consistent spot cleaning keeps shoes looking neat. It avoids the build-up that requires a full wash.

#### Effective Odor Control Strategies

Sweat and bacteria are the main culprits behind smelly running shoes. To combat odors, I never store my shoes in a dark, enclosed space like a gym bag. Instead, I let them air out in a well-ventilated area after every run. I sometimes remove the insoles. This allows both the shoe interior and the insole to dry completely. For persistent odors, I use natural deodorizers. Baking soda is excellent. I sprinkle a tablespoon inside each shoe overnight. It absorbs moisture and neutralizes smells. Coffee grounds or activated charcoal packets also work well. Replacing insoles periodically can also make a big difference. If odors are really strong, machine washing specifically for smell removal is an option: [How to Wash Smelly Shoes in Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-smelly-shoes-in-washing-machine).

#### Proper Storage and Rotation Practices

How you store your Brooks running shoes impacts their longevity. I keep my shoes in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Sunlight can fade colors and degrade materials. Extreme heat or cold can affect adhesives and cushioning. I also rotate my running shoes if I have more than one pair. This allows each pair to fully dry out and recover its cushioning. It extends the life of each individual pair. Consistent maintenance helps my shoes perform at their best for many miles. This ultimately saves me money in the long run.

### Frequently Asked Questions About Washing Brooks Running Shoes

When it comes to cleaning running shoes, many questions arise. I have gathered some common queries about washing Brooks running shoes. Here are the answers to help you keep your footwear in top shape.

#### How often should I wash my Brooks running shoes?
I recommend washing your Brooks running shoes only when they are visibly dirty or start to smell. Over-washing can cause premature wear and tear. For most runners, this means a deep clean every few months. Regular spot cleaning and airing out after runs are better for daily maintenance.

#### Can I use bleach on my white Brooks shoes?
No, I strongly advise against using bleach on your Brooks running shoes. Bleach can damage the fabric fibers, weaken adhesives, and cause discoloration or yellowing, especially on synthetic materials. For white shoes, use a gentle shoe cleaner designed for athletic footwear. A mixture of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide can also brighten whites safely. This article provides good tips for [How to Clean White Running Shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-running-shoes).

#### What if my Brooks shoes still smell after washing?
If your Brooks shoes still smell after washing, ensure they are completely dry inside. Dampness can harbor odor-causing bacteria. I suggest trying additional odor control methods. Sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit overnight. Activated charcoal inserts also absorb lingering smells. Sometimes, replacing old insoles can solve the problem too.

#### Is it okay to put insoles in the washing machine?
No, I generally do not recommend putting insoles directly into the washing machine. Insoles can lose their shape or cushioning integrity in the machine. It is better to hand wash them. Use mild soap and a soft brush. Rinse them thoroughly and air dry them flat. This preserves their support and comfort.

#### Can washing machines damage the cushioning of Brooks shoes?
Yes, washing machines can potentially damage the cushioning of Brooks shoes if not used carefully. High spin cycles and hot water are particularly harmful. They can compress or degrade the foam. Always use a cold water, delicate cycle with a low spin speed. This minimizes impact and helps preserve the responsive cushioning that Brooks is known for.

#### Should I use a special detergent for athletic shoes?
A special detergent for athletic shoes is not strictly necessary. I find that a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent works perfectly well. Avoid harsh detergents with strong chemicals, bleaches, or fabric softeners. These can harm the shoe materials. Look for gentle, eco-friendly options. They clean effectively without causing damage.

### Conclusion

Keeping your Brooks running shoes clean is essential for their longevity and your comfort. We have learned that machine washing is possible, but it requires careful attention to detail. My experience confirms that with the right preparation and settings, you can get your shoes fresh again. Remember to remove laces and insoles, pre-treat stains, and use a mesh laundry bag. Always choose a cold, delicate cycle with mild detergent. Crucially, always air dry your shoes completely. Never use a machine dryer.

Hand washing remains a gentler alternative for delicate shoes or targeted cleaning. Regular maintenance between washes, like brushing off dirt and controlling odors, also goes a long way.
