### Exploring The Brick's Area Rug Selection

The Brick is a popular store for home furnishings. Many people know them for furniture and appliances. They also carry a good selection of home decor items. This includes area rugs. You can find rugs for almost any room in your house.

Their range includes modern designs and classic patterns. You might find shag rugs for comfort. Flat-weave rugs offer a sleek look. Traditional Persian-style rugs add elegance. Contemporary geometric patterns provide a modern touch. The variety helps you match your home's style.

The materials used vary too. Some rugs are made from synthetic fibers like polypropylene. These are durable and easy to clean. They work well in high-traffic areas. Other rugs feature natural fibers such as wool or cotton. These offer a softer feel and unique textures. Consider the material based on your lifestyle and room usage.

They offer different piles as well. Low-pile rugs are easy to vacuum. They work well under dining tables. High-pile or shag rugs feel luxurious underfoot. They add coziness to a living room or bedroom. The Brick aims to provide options for every taste and functional need. When looking for a wide variety, it is helpful to explore different retailers. For example, some people ask, [does Target sell area rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-target-sell-area-rugs)? Knowing where else to look can broaden your choices.

### Shopping for Area Rugs: Online vs. In-Store

Buying an area rug involves choices about where to shop. The Brick offers two main ways to buy: online and in-store. Each method has its own benefits. Knowing these helps you decide which works best for you.

Shopping online at The Brick is convenient. You can browse their entire collection from home. The website allows you to filter by size, color, style, and material. This makes finding specific rugs easy. Online descriptions and photos help you visualize the rug. Reading customer reviews can offer more insight. However, colors might look different on your screen. The texture can also be hard to judge without touching it.

Visiting a physical Brick store gives you a different experience. You can see the rugs in person. You can touch the materials. This helps you understand the true texture and pile height. You can also see the exact colors. This is helpful for matching existing decor. Store staff can answer questions and offer advice. They can help you compare different options side-by-side. The main downside might be a smaller selection on the showroom floor. Not all online rugs are displayed in every store.

I find that a mix of both works best. I often browse online first to narrow down my choices. Then, I visit the store to see my top picks in person. This approach combines convenience with confidence. If you want to see other retailer options, you might wonder, [does Ross sell area rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-ross-sell-area-rugs)? Exploring different stores gives you more chances to find the perfect rug.

### Sizes and Shapes of Area Rugs at The Brick

Choosing the right size and shape is very important for an area rug. A rug that is too small can make a room feel disjointed. One that is too large can overwhelm the space. The Brick provides various sizes and shapes to fit many room dimensions.

Common sizes include 5x7 feet, 8x10 feet, and 9x12 feet. These are popular for living rooms and dining areas. Smaller rugs, like 2x3 feet or 3x5 feet, work well in entryways. They are also good for under accent chairs. Runner rugs are long and narrow. They fit perfectly in hallways or beside beds. Consider where the rug will go and how much furniture it needs to anchor.

To pick the right size, measure your room first. Then, consider your furniture layout. For a living room, aim for a rug that extends under the front legs of all main seating pieces. In a dining room, ensure the rug is large enough. All chair legs should stay on the rug even when pulled out. This prevents chairs from catching on the rug's edge.

The Brick also offers different shapes. Rectangular rugs are the most common. They fit most rooms well. Round rugs can add a unique element. They soften angular furniture and create a focal point. Oval rugs offer a similar effect. Sometimes, you might find irregular shapes. These can create a modern or artistic look. Think about the overall geometry of your room. Let the rug complement or contrast with it. Many people find it useful to place rugs even when they have carpet.

Knowing these options helps in planning your room's look.

### Pricing and Value of The Brick's Area Rugs

When buying an area rug, cost is always a factor. The Brick offers rugs at various price points. This means you can find options to fit different budgets. Understanding what influences rug prices helps you make a good choice.

Several factors affect the price of an area rug. Material is a big one. Synthetic rugs, like those made from polypropylene, are generally more affordable. They offer good durability for the price. Natural fiber rugs, such as wool, cost more. They often provide a softer feel and a longer lifespan. The complexity of the design also plays a role. Intricate patterns or hand-knotted rugs typically cost more. Machine-made rugs are usually less expensive.

Size is another key determinant. Larger rugs naturally cost more than smaller ones. A 9x12-foot rug will be pricier than a 5x7-foot rug. You should balance your budget with your room's needs. Sometimes, investing in a slightly larger rug can make a big difference. It can make the room feel more complete.

The Brick often has sales and promotions. It is a good idea to watch for these events. You might find a high-quality rug at a reduced price. Compare their prices with other retailers. This ensures you get a good deal. Consider the rug's expected lifespan and durability. A slightly more expensive rug that lasts longer might offer better value. For instance, comparing prices might lead you to ask, [does Rooms to Go sell area rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-rooms-to-go-sell-area-rugs)? Exploring these options helps you find the best value.

### Complementary Home Decor: Matching Rugs with Furniture

An area rug does more than cover the floor. It ties your furniture together. It defines spaces in open-concept homes. Matching your rug with your existing furniture creates a cohesive look. This makes your room feel complete and inviting.

Consider the colors in your room. Your rug can echo existing colors. It can also introduce a new accent color. If your furniture is neutral, a colorful rug adds vibrancy. If your furniture is bold, a neutral rug helps balance the space. Look at your wall color, cushions, and artwork. Choose a rug that complements these elements. Do not make the rug compete too much with other patterns.

Think about the style of your furniture. Modern furniture often pairs well with geometric or abstract rugs. Traditional furniture might suit classic Persian or floral patterns. Farmhouse decor could use jute or distressed rugs. The rug should feel like a natural extension of your chosen style. It should not look like an afterthought.

Texture also matters. A shaggy rug adds softness to a minimalist room. A smooth, low-pile rug creates a sleek look. This works well with contemporary furniture. Mix textures for a richer, more layered feel. For example, pair a smooth leather sofa with a textured wool rug. The goal is to create visual interest. Your rug should enhance your furniture, not fight with it. Understanding how other stores handle this synergy can also be beneficial, for instance, by checking if [does Fred Meyer sell area rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-fredmeyer-sell-area-rugs).

### Caring for Your New Area Rug from The Brick

Taking good care of your area rug helps it last longer. Proper maintenance keeps it looking fresh and vibrant. The Brick's rugs come with care instructions. It is wise to follow these closely. Different materials require different cleaning methods.

Regular vacuuming is the first step. This removes dirt and dust. It prevents particles from settling deep into the fibers. Vacuum at least once a week, more often in high-traffic areas. Use a vacuum with adjustable height settings. This helps protect the rug's pile. For fringe, use the hose attachment. Avoid vacuuming over fringe directly with the main brush.

Spot cleaning is important for spills. Act quickly when spills happen. Blot the spill with a clean cloth. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. Use a mild rug cleaner or a mixture of water and gentle soap. Test any cleaning product on a small, hidden area first. This ensures it does not discolor the rug.

Some rugs may need professional cleaning. This is usually recommended every 12 to 18 months. Professional cleaners have specialized equipment. They can deep clean your rug without damaging it. Rotate your rug periodically. This helps ensure even wear. It also reduces sun fading on one side. By taking these steps, your area rug from The Brick will stay beautiful for many years. Sometimes, understanding how to maintain existing items can be useful, like learning how to [clean brick](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-brick) if you have an exposed brick wall near your rug.

### Comparing The Brick to Other Rug Retailers

The Brick is a strong option for buying area rugs. However, many other stores also sell them. Comparing different retailers helps you find the best selection and prices. Each store has its own strengths and inventory.

Big box stores often carry a wide variety. Stores like Home Depot or Lowe's have many options. They usually focus on value and practicality. Their selections might lean towards durable, everyday rugs. Furniture specialty stores, like Ashley HomeStore, often have rugs that complement their furniture lines. These might offer more coordinated design choices.

Discount retailers sometimes offer great deals. Places like Marshalls or TJ Maxx often have unique finds. Their inventory changes frequently. You might find high-quality rugs at lower prices. However, selection is not guaranteed. What they have one day might be gone the next. Online-only stores, such as Wayfair or Rugs.com, boast vast selections. You can filter through thousands of options. They often provide competitive pricing and home delivery. But you cannot see the rug in person before buying.

When considering options, remember that various retailers cater to different needs. For example, some people wonder, [does Hobby Lobby sell area rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-hobby-lobby-sell-area-rugs)? Knowing about these different stores expands your choices. Each store provides a distinct shopping experience. Always check return policies before purchasing, especially for large items like rugs. This comparison helps you make an informed decision.

### Maximizing Your Rug Investment: Longevity and Upkeep

Buying an area rug is an investment in your home's comfort and style. To maximize this investment, focus on longevity and upkeep. A well-chosen and well-maintained rug can serve your home for many years. This section provides tips to ensure your rug remains a beautiful part of your decor.

Consider the rug's intended location. High-traffic areas, like hallways or living room entrances, need more durable rugs. Look for rugs made from sturdy synthetic fibers or tightly woven wool. These materials resist wear and tear better. Low-traffic areas, such as bedrooms, can accommodate softer, more delicate rugs. Choosing the right rug for the right spot extends its life.

Using a rug pad is a simple but effective strategy. A good rug pad offers several benefits. It prevents the rug from slipping. This enhances safety. It also provides extra cushioning underfoot. Most importantly, a rug pad protects the rug's fibers. It absorbs impact. This reduces wear from foot traffic. It also helps with air circulation. This prevents moisture buildup and mold. Choose a pad that matches your rug's size.

Regular cleaning and immediate spill treatment are vital. As mentioned before, consistent vacuuming keeps dirt from embedding. Blotting spills quickly prevents permanent stains. For deeper cleaning, consider professional services. They use methods safe for your specific rug material. These steps keep your rug looking new for longer. If you ever decide to change your decor, you might consider selling your old rug.
