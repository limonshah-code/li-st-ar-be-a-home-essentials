There are few things as frustrating as a dishwasher that quits in the middle of its cycle. If you own a Kenmore dishwasher, you might experience this issue. This problem causes dirty dishes and adds unexpected stress to your day. You might wonder, "Why does my Kenmore dishwasher keep stopping?"

Understanding the root cause is the first step toward a solution. Many factors contribute to a Kenmore dishwasher stopping unexpectedly. These range from simple power problems to more complex component failures. This article guides you through common reasons why your Kenmore dishwasher stops. We provide clear, actionable steps to diagnose and resolve these issues. Let's make your Kenmore dishwasher run smoothly again.

### Takeaway

If your Kenmore dishwasher stops mid-cycle, consider these key steps:

*   **Check power and door latch:** Ensure stable power and a fully closed door.
*   **Inspect water supply and drain:** Confirm proper water flow and clear drainage.
*   **Clean filters:** Remove food particles blocking the system.
*   **Look for error codes:** Consult your manual for code meanings.
*   **Assess components:** Examine the float switch, heating element, or control board for faults.
*   **Call a professional:** Seek expert help for complex internal part failures.

A Kenmore dishwasher stops mid-cycle due to several issues, including power problems, a faulty door latch, insufficient water supply, drainage blockages, or internal component failures like the heating element, float switch, or control board. Identifying the specific cause helps you fix the problem efficiently.

## Power Supply and Electrical Connections: First Checks for a Stopping Kenmore

The first place to look when your Kenmore dishwasher keeps stopping is its power supply. Many appliance problems trace back to simple electrical interruptions. Your dishwasher needs consistent power to complete its wash cycle. A loose plug or a tripped circuit breaker interrupts this power flow.

Begin by checking the dishwasher’s power cord. Ensure it plugs securely into the wall outlet. Sometimes, vibrations cause the plug to loosen over time. Next, inspect your home’s electrical panel. Find the breaker switch labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. If it sits in the “off” or middle position, it has tripped. Simply reset it by flipping it fully off, then back to the “on” position.

Power fluctuations also cause a dishwasher to stop. If other appliances struggle or lights flicker, the issue might be with your home's main power. Test the outlet itself by plugging in a small appliance, like a hair dryer. If that appliance also does not work, the outlet or its circuit requires attention from an electrician. Addressing these basic electrical checks often resolves unexpected stops in your dishwasher's operation.

## Door Latch and Switch Issues: Ensuring Proper Closure

Your Kenmore dishwasher relies on a secure door latch to operate. The door latch holds the door tightly closed during a cycle. It also activates a safety switch. This switch signals the dishwasher that it is safe to run. If the door is not fully closed, or if the latch mechanism is faulty, the dishwasher will stop.

First, check the dishwasher door. Push it firmly to ensure it clicks into place. Sometimes, dishes inside obstruct the door, preventing a full closure. Adjust your loading if this is the case. Over time, the door latch itself can wear out or become misaligned. You might notice the door feels loose or does not engage properly.

The door latch assembly contains a small switch. This switch tells the control board when the door is secure. If this switch malfunctions, the dishwasher thinks the door is open. It then pauses or stops the cycle as a safety measure. Inspect the latch for visible damage or debris. Replacing a worn door latch or its switch is often a straightforward repair. This ensures your dishwasher receives the correct signal to continue running.

## Water Inlet and Drainage Problems: Impact on Cycle Completion

Proper water flow is essential for any dishwasher. Your Kenmore dishwasher needs enough water to wash dishes effectively. It also needs to drain that water away afterward. Issues with either the water inlet or the drainage system can cause your dishwasher to stop.

If your dishwasher stops early in the cycle, it might not be getting enough water. Check the water inlet valve. This valve controls water entry into the appliance. A clogged screen inside the valve or a faulty valve prevents sufficient water intake. Also, ensure the hot water supply valve under your sink is fully open. Sometimes, it gets accidentally bumped closed.

Similarly, drainage problems cause the dishwasher to stop later in the cycle. If water remains at the bottom, the dishwasher cannot progress. A common culprit is a clogged drain hose. Food particles and grease build up over time. This blockage stops water from leaving the tub. You might also have a faulty drain pump. The pump removes the wastewater. If it fails, water just sits there. Understanding [why your Kenmore dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kenmore-dishwasher-not-drain) helps you pinpoint this issue. Regularly inspecting these components keeps water flowing correctly.

## Overheating and Thermal Fuse Protection: When Your Dishwasher Gets Too Hot

Dishwashers contain safety features to prevent damage from overheating. Your Kenmore dishwasher has a thermal fuse. This small component acts as a safeguard. If internal temperatures become too high, the thermal fuse trips. This cuts power to the dishwasher. The cycle then stops completely to prevent a fire or damage to other parts.

Overheating often happens due to a faulty heating element. The heating element warms the water during the wash cycle and helps dry dishes. If it runs continuously or incorrectly, it generates excessive heat. A blocked vent or spray arm also causes heat to build up inside the dishwasher. This blockage prevents proper heat dissipation.

When the thermal fuse blows, it needs replacement. You cannot reset it. Before replacing the fuse, you must identify the cause of the overheating. Otherwise, the new fuse will blow again. Check the heating element for continuity with a multimeter. Inspect vents and spray arms for clogs. Addressing the root cause protects your dishwasher. This keeps it from stopping due to overheating.

## The Control Board and Sensor Malfunctions: Smart System Glitches

Modern Kenmore dishwashers use electronic control boards. These boards are like the brain of the appliance. They manage all functions, from water intake to cycle timing. Sensors also send information to the control board. If the control board malfunctions, or if a sensor sends incorrect data, your dishwasher will stop.

The control board contains complex circuitry. A power surge can damage it. Age and wear also cause components on the board to fail. When this happens, the board might send wrong signals. It might tell the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle without a clear reason. You might see erratic behavior or strange error codes.

Sensors play a vital role. For instance, the float switch detects water levels. If the float switch sticks or fails, the dishwasher might overfill or underfill. This triggers a safety stop. The turbidity sensor detects how dirty the water is. If it malfunctions, it can disrupt cycle progression. Diagnosing control board or sensor issues often requires a technician. They use specialized tools to test these parts. Sometimes, a simple reset of the dishwasher fixes minor glitches. You do this by cutting power for a few minutes.

## Motor and Pump Assembly Problems: Heart of Your Dishwasher's Operation

The motor and pump assembly are critical for your Kenmore dishwasher's operation. The motor powers the pump. The pump circulates water through the spray arms. It also pushes water out during the drain cycle. If either the motor or pump fails, the dishwasher cannot complete its cycle. It will stop.

A failing wash motor might make strange noises before quitting. You might hear grinding or humming sounds. Sometimes, the motor simply stops working altogether. This means water will not spray. Your dishes will not get clean. The dishwasher cycle will halt because water circulation is essential.

The drain pump is also crucial. It removes dirty water from the tub. If the drain pump is faulty, water will stay in the bottom of the dishwasher. This prevents the next cycle segment from starting. The dishwasher will pause or stop. Clogs in the pump impeller also cause problems. Food debris can get caught. This obstructs the pump's movement. Regular cleaning of filters helps prevent these clogs. For example, knowing [how to clean the filter in a Kenmore dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-filter-in-a-kenmore-dishwasher) helps keep the pump running efficiently. If you hear no motor noise or feel no vibration, the motor or pump assembly likely has an issue.

## Addressing Clogs and Debris in Your Kenmore Dishwasher

Clogs are a common reason why dishwashers stop. Food particles, grease, and other debris accumulate inside the appliance. These block critical components. When parts are blocked, they cannot perform their functions. This leads to cycle interruptions.

The filter is the first line of defense against clogs. Your Kenmore dishwasher has a filter system. This system catches large food scraps. If the filter is full, it restricts water flow. This impacts washing performance and drainage. [Knowing where the filter is on a Kenmore dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-filter-on-kenmore-dishwasher) is important for maintenance. A dirty filter can cause your dishwasher to stop mid-cycle because water cannot properly circulate or drain.

Beyond the filter, debris can clog spray arms. Small holes in the spray arms become blocked. This prevents water from reaching all dishes. It can also create pressure issues within the pump system. The drain hose is another common spot for clogs. Bits of food or hardened detergent can form blockages. These blockages prevent dirty water from exiting. Regularly inspecting and cleaning your dishwasher’s filter, spray arms, and drain hose can prevent many stopping issues. This simple maintenance extends the life of your appliance.

## Float Switch Malfunctions and Overflow Protection

Your Kenmore dishwasher has an important safety device called a float switch. This switch sits at the bottom of the tub. Its purpose is to detect the water level. As water enters, a float rises. When the float reaches a certain height, it activates the switch. This signals the control board to stop filling with water. This prevents overfilling and potential leaks.

If the float switch gets stuck in the "up" position, it constantly tells the dishwasher the tub is full. The dishwasher will then stop filling with water prematurely. It might even start and immediately drain, thinking there is too much water. Conversely, if the float switch is stuck "down" or is faulty, the dishwasher might overfill. This triggers other safety mechanisms, which also cause the cycle to stop.

Sometimes, food debris or a broken part can jam the float. You can often see the float inside the tub. Check if it moves freely. Clean any visible obstructions around it. A faulty float switch needs replacement. This issue is similar to problems found in other appliances, such as [why an LG dishwasher keeps stopping mid-cycle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-keep-stopping-mid-cycle). Ensuring your float switch works correctly is key to proper water level management and uninterrupted cycles.

## Error Codes and Diagnostics for Your Kenmore Dishwasher

Many modern Kenmore dishwashers feature error code displays. When your dishwasher stops, it might show a series of letters and numbers. These codes are important diagnostic tools. They point you directly to the problem area. Consulting your owner's manual for these codes is crucial. The manual provides specific meanings and troubleshooting steps for each code.

Different error codes indicate different issues. For example, a code might signal a problem with the water inlet, the drain pump, or a temperature sensor. Some codes are common across various Kenmore models. Others are specific to certain series. It is always best to refer to your exact model's manual. If you no longer have your manual, you can often find it online on the Kenmore support website.

Once you know the error code, you can research the specific repair. Sometimes, a simple fix like clearing a clog resolves the issue. Other times, it indicates a component failure. Understanding these codes empowers you to troubleshoot more effectively. It helps you decide if you can fix it yourself or if you need to call a professional technician. Always note the error code before attempting any repairs.
