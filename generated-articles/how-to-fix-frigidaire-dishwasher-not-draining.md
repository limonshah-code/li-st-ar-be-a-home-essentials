### Clear Answer

To fix a Frigidaire dishwasher not draining, first check for simple clogs in the filter, drain hose, or air gap. Ensure the garbage disposal is clear and running. If these basic steps fail, inspect the drain pump for obstructions or malfunction, and confirm the float switch and check valve are functioning properly.

## Initial Troubleshooting Steps for a Frigidaire Dishwasher Not Draining

When your Frigidaire dishwasher is not draining, the first step is to perform some basic checks. These initial steps often resolve the issue without requiring deeper investigation. It is important to rule out simple problems before moving to more complex diagnostics. I always start here when I face this problem at home.

First, verify the dishwasher has power. Sometimes a tripped circuit breaker can interrupt the cycle before it completes the drain phase. Check your home's electrical panel for any tripped breakers related to the kitchen or dishwasher. Reset the breaker if it is tripped. Ensure the dishwasher door is closed and latched properly. Many dishwashers will not complete a cycle, including draining, if the door switch is not engaged.

Next, make sure you selected the correct wash cycle. Some cycles, like "rinse only" or "delicate," may use less water or have different drain patterns. Ensure you are not accidentally interrupting the cycle. Do not open the door during the drain portion of the cycle. Also, check for any error codes on your dishwasher's display. Frigidaire models often display codes that point directly to the problem. Consult your owner's manual for specific code meanings. These simple checks can save you significant time and effort. Always begin troubleshooting with these basic steps to ensure a smooth repair process.

## Clearing a Clogged Frigidaire Dishwasher Filter

A clogged filter is the most common reason a Frigidaire dishwasher does not drain. Food particles, grease, and debris accumulate in the filter over time. This buildup prevents water from flowing freely into the drain pump. Cleaning your dishwasher filter regularly is a simple maintenance task that prevents many drain issues. I make sure to do this every few months in my own home.

To access the filter, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dish rack. You will see the filter assembly at the bottom, usually in the center. Frigidaire dishwashers typically have a two-part filter system: a coarse filter and a fine mesh filter. The coarse filter catches larger food particles. The fine mesh filter traps smaller debris.

Twist the top part of the filter counter-clockwise to unlock it. Lift both filter components out of the dishwasher. Take them to your sink and rinse them under warm running water. Use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to gently scrub away any stubborn food residue or grease. You can also use a small amount of dish soap to help remove greasy buildup. Ensure you clean all crevices thoroughly. Once clean, rinse the filters again and return them to the dishwasher. Align the coarse filter correctly in its housing. Then, place the fine mesh filter on top and twist clockwise to lock it securely in place. Regularly cleaning your Frigidaire dishwasher filter helps prevent future draining problems. You can find detailed instructions on [how to clean your Frigidaire dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-frigidaire-dishwasher-filter) and [how to put Frigidaire dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-frigidaire-dishwasher-filter-back-in) to ensure you perform this task correctly.

## Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your home's drain line or garbage disposal. Kinks, clogs, or improper installation of this hose can stop your Frigidaire dishwasher from draining. This is a common point of failure that many people overlook. I always check the hose thoroughly after the filter.

First, locate the drain hose. It usually connects to the back of the dishwasher and runs to a connection under your sink. Pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet recess slightly if needed to access the hose. Visually inspect the entire length of the hose for any visible kinks or sharp bends. These can restrict water flow, acting like a blocked artery. Straighten any kinks you find. If the hose is permanently bent or crimped, you may need to replace it.

Next, check for clogs inside the hose. Disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the drain connection under the sink. Have a bucket ready to catch any residual water. Use a flashlight to look inside the hose for blockages. Food debris, grease, or even small foreign objects can get stuck here. You can try to clear a clog using a long, flexible brush, like a drain snake, or by flushing water through the hose from a faucet. If the hose is severely clogged or damaged, replacing it is often the best solution. Ensure the new hose is properly routed without any bends or kinks. Also, make sure the hose forms a high loop under the sink. This high loop prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. A proper high loop is crucial for effective drainage and preventing contamination.

## Addressing the Air Gap and Garbage Disposal Connections

If your Frigidaire dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, or uses an air gap, these components can prevent proper drainage. These are common culprits, especially after new installations or if the disposal gets heavily used. Many people forget about these connections when troubleshooting.

### Checking the Garbage Disposal

If your dishwasher connects to a garbage disposal, the disposal must be clear of food debris. A clogged disposal will back up into the dishwasher, preventing it from draining. Always run your garbage disposal for about 30 seconds with cold water before starting a dishwasher cycle. This clears any food waste that could impede drainage. If you recently installed a new garbage disposal, ensure the knockout plug was removed. This plug is inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet port. Failing to remove it will completely block drainage. Insert a screwdriver into the inlet hole and tap the plug out with a hammer. Retrieve the plug from inside the disposal before proceeding. Ensure the connection between the dishwasher drain hose and the disposal is secure and free of clogs.

### Inspecting the Air Gap

Some plumbing codes require an air gap device, typically mounted on your sink counter near the faucet. An air gap prevents dirty drain water from siphoning back into your clean water supply. If your Frigidaire dishwasher uses an air gap, it can become clogged with food particles. This blockage will prevent the dishwasher from draining. Remove the chrome cap and plastic cover from the air gap. Inspect the internal components for any visible debris. Clear any blockages with a small brush or a paper clip. Reassemble the air gap once it is clean. This simple cleaning can often resolve stubborn draining problems.

## Diagnosing a Faulty Drain Pump

The drain pump is a crucial component that actively pushes water out of your Frigidaire dishwasher. If your dishwasher has power and the filters and hoses are clear, the drain pump might be the problem. A failing pump, or one obstructed by debris, will prevent water from exiting the appliance. This step requires a bit more effort but is very common.

Accessing the drain pump usually means removing the lower access panel or pulling the dishwasher out completely. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before starting this process. You can turn off the circuit breaker that supplies power to the dishwasher. Once you access the pump, visually inspect it for any foreign objects. Small items like broken glass, plastic pieces, or even large food chunks can get lodged in the impeller. The impeller is the rotating part that moves water. Remove any obstructions carefully. Be cautious of sharp objects.

You should also check the pump's impeller for physical damage. A broken impeller will not be able to push water effectively. If you do not see any visible obstructions, the pump motor itself might be faulty. You can test the pump motor's continuity with a multimeter, but this requires some electrical knowledge. If the pump runs but makes a grinding noise, it likely has a blockage or is failing. If the pump does not hum or activate during the drain cycle, it may have failed electrically. Replacing a drain pump involves disconnecting wiring and plumbing connections. This can be a more involved repair, and you may want to reference resources like [how to put Frigidaire dishwasher back together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-frigidaire-dishwasher-back-together) for reassembly tips after any major component replacement. If you are not comfortable with electrical work, consider hiring a professional.

## Checking the Drain Check Valve

The drain check valve is a small, one-way valve located in the drain pump or the drain hose connection. Its purpose is to prevent drained water from flowing back into the dishwasher tub. If this valve gets stuck in the closed position or becomes clogged, water cannot exit the dishwasher. This is a common cause of standing water even after the drain cycle finishes. I have seen this issue many times, and it is easy to overlook.

To inspect the check valve, you will first need to access the drain pump area, as the valve is often integrated into the pump housing or a component connected directly to it. Ensure the power to your Frigidaire dishwasher is off before you begin. You might need to disconnect the drain hose from the pump or remove the pump itself. The check valve often looks like a small rubber flapper or a plastic ball.

Examine the valve for any debris that might be lodged in it, preventing it from opening. Food particles, detergent residue, or even mineral deposits can cause it to stick. Gently clean the valve and its housing. Make sure the flapper can move freely or the ball can roll without obstruction. If the check valve is damaged or broken, it will need to be replaced. A damaged check valve might also cause issues where the dishwasher seems to drain but then refills with dirty water. This indicates the valve is not holding water back effectively. Replacing this small part can make a big difference in ensuring proper drainage for your Frigidaire dishwasher.

## Inspecting the Float Switch Assembly

The float switch is a safety device in your Frigidaire dishwasher. It detects the water level in the tub. If the water level rises too high, the float switch signals the control board to stop filling and activate the drain pump. If this switch malfunctions, it might incorrectly tell the dishwasher that there is too much water, preventing it from draining properly. Conversely, it might fail to activate the drain cycle.

The float switch is typically located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, often covered by a small cap or housing. It usually consists of a plastic float that rises with the water level. As the float rises, it lifts a rod or magnet, which then activates a microswitch. First, remove the bottom dish rack and the spray arm to gain better access. You may need to remove the lower panel or filter screen.

Inspect the float mechanism. Ensure it moves freely up and down. Food particles, grease, or debris can accumulate around the float, causing it to stick. Carefully clean the area around the float. Make sure nothing obstructs its movement. If the float is physically stuck in the "up" position, the dishwasher thinks it is full and will not drain. This often leads to drain pump activation issues. If the float moves freely, the problem might be with the microswitch itself. You can test the microswitch for continuity with a multimeter, but this requires some electrical knowledge. If the switch is faulty, it will need replacement. This is a vital safety feature, so ensuring it works correctly is important for both draining and preventing overflows.

## Understanding and Clearing Sump and Impeller Area

Beyond the filter, the sump area and impeller within the drain pump are critical for drainage. The sump collects water before it reaches the drain pump. The impeller, part of the pump, actively pushes water out. These areas can become blocked, even if your main filter is clean. It is a common place for stubborn clogs.

To access the sump, you usually need to remove the lower spray arm and the main filter assembly. Once these are out, you will see the sump at the very bottom of the dishwasher tub. It might have a small screen or grate covering the entrance to the drain pump. This screen prevents larger debris from entering the pump. Inspect this screen for any trapped food particles, broken glass, or other small objects. Use a wet/dry vacuum to suction out any standing water. Then, use a cloth or sponge to wipe the area clean.

Next, you will need to look into the drain pump impeller area. This is often just below or behind the sump screen. You may need to carefully reach into the opening to feel for obstructions. Be careful, as broken glass or sharp objects might be present. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers or tweezers to remove any debris you find. Ensure the impeller can spin freely. Sometimes, hair or string can get wrapped around the impeller shaft, hindering its rotation. If you cannot feel or see the impeller moving, the pump might be seized or faulty. Clearing this area ensures that water has a clear path to the drain pump and that the pump can effectively push the water out of your Frigidaire dishwasher. This internal cleaning is often the final piece of the puzzle for drain issues.

## Preventing Future Frigidaire Dishwasher Drain Issues

Preventing drain problems with your Frigidaire dishwasher is much easier than fixing them. Regular maintenance and proper usage habits can significantly extend the life of your appliance and keep it running smoothly. I have learned over time that a little preventive care goes a long way.

First and foremost, clean your dishwasher filter regularly. Make it a habit to clean it at least once a month, or more often if you frequently wash heavily soiled dishes. Removing food particles and grease from the filter prevents them from reaching the drain pump and causing clogs. Secondly, scrape off large food scraps from plates before loading them into the dishwasher. While dishwashers can handle small particles, large chunks of food, bones, or fruit pits can easily clog the filter or drain hose.

Third, use the correct amount and type of dishwasher detergent. Too much detergent can create excessive suds, which can hinder draining. Certain detergents can also leave residue that builds up over time and causes blockages. Use high-quality detergent designed for automatic dishwashers. Fourth, run your garbage disposal before starting the dishwasher cycle if they share a drain line. This clears any food debris that could back up into the dishwasher. Consider running an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or a cup of white vinegar periodically. This helps break down grease and mineral buildup in the internal components. You can learn more about this by reading [how to clean Frigidaire dishwasher with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-frigidaire-dishwasher-with-vinegar). By following these simple maintenance tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of your Frigidaire dishwasher not draining in the future.
