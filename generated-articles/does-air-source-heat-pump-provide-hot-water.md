## Understanding How Air Source Heat Pumps Heat Water

An air source heat pump works by moving heat from one place to another. It does not generate heat directly like a boiler. The system absorbs heat from the outdoor air, even on cold days. This heat then transfers to a refrigerant fluid.

The refrigerant warms up and gets compressed. This compression raises its temperature even more. The hot, high-pressure refrigerant then moves through a heat exchanger. Here, it transfers its warmth to your home's water supply. This is how an air source heat pump provides hot water. You can learn more about this process by reading [How Does Heat Pump Hot Water System Work](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-does-heat-pump-hot-water-system-work).

The warmed water gets stored in a hot water cylinder. This ensures you have hot water ready when you need it. The refrigerant, now cooler, expands and returns to its low-pressure state. It then repeats the cycle, constantly extracting heat from the air. This continuous cycle makes air source heat pumps very efficient for domestic hot water production. They extract much more energy than they consume.

## Types of Air Source Heat Pump Systems for Hot Water

Air source heat pumps can provide hot water in a few different ways. The most common setup involves a system that handles both space heating and domestic hot water. This integrated approach uses one heat pump unit to serve two purposes. It simplifies your home's heating infrastructure.
