## How to Deflate Your Vango Mattress Easily

Putting away your camping gear after a great trip can feel like a chore. One common challenge is getting your Vango mattress completely deflated. A fully deflated Vango mattress saves space in your car and at home. It also protects your mattress from damage during storage. I understand the frustration of trying to squeeze an air mattress back into its bag. This guide will make the process simple for you.

Here, I will walk you through clear steps to deflate your Vango mattress effectively. You will learn about manual methods and using a pump. I will also share tips for proper rolling and storage. You will find solutions to common deflation problems. Let's make packing up your Vango mattress easy every time.

### Takeaway

*   Locate and open the Vango mattress valve system fully.
*   Use body weight or a pump to push air out of the mattress.
*   Roll the mattress tightly from the end opposite the valve.
*   Secure the deflated Vango mattress properly for compact storage.
*   Clean and dry your mattress before long-term storage to prevent damage.

To deflate a Vango mattress, first locate its valve. Open the valve completely. Then, apply gentle pressure or use a pump to push all the air out. Roll the mattress tightly from the opposite end towards the open valve. This pushes remaining air out. Finally, seal the valve and secure the rolled mattress for storage.

### Essential Steps to Deflate Your Vango Mattress

Getting your Vango mattress ready for deflation starts with a few key actions. First, find a large, clean, and flat surface. This could be your tent floor, a clean patch of ground, or an indoor space. A flat surface helps you remove air evenly. It also prevents dirt from getting onto your mattress. Make sure the area is free from sharp objects that could puncture the mattress.

Vango mattresses come with different valve designs. Most Vango valves are push-pull, twist-and-pull, or Boston valves. You need to identify your specific valve type. This helps you open it correctly. A typical Vango valve might require you to pull the cap off. Then, you might push a small tab or twist the valve base. Some self-inflating Vango models have valves that you simply unscrew.

Once you find the valve, open it completely. This allows air to escape freely. Some Vango mattresses have a two-way valve system. One part lets air in, and the other lets air out. Make sure you open the deflation valve. Sometimes, it is the larger opening. You will hear the air start to escape as soon as you open it. This initial hiss is a good sign that you are on the right track. Be patient, as some air will come out naturally.

Many Vango air beds also have an internal foam core, especially their self-inflating mats. For these, opening the valve starts the self-deflation process. The foam helps push air out. However, you will still need to apply pressure to get all the air out. For general tips on how to manage air flow during this process, you can explore guides on [how to deflate a mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-deflate-a-mattress). This helps you understand the basics of air mattress deflation.

### Manual Deflation Techniques for Vango Mattresses

Once the initial air escapes from your Vango mattress, you need to apply pressure. Manual deflation is effective for all Vango models. It requires a bit of effort but ensures thorough air removal. Start by lying on the mattress yourself. Your body weight will press out a significant amount of air. Position yourself over different sections of the mattress. Work your way from one end to the other. You will feel the air moving towards the open valve.

After the first pass, begin the rolling technique. This method is crucial for getting your Vango mattress as flat as possible. Start rolling the mattress tightly from the end opposite the open valve. As you roll, kneel or press down on the rolled section. This forces the air trapped inside to move forward. Imagine squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. You want to push all the air towards the valve opening. Keep the roll tight and even.

You might need to unroll and re-roll the mattress a few times. This is normal. Each time, you will push out more trapped air. Pay attention to the corners and edges. Air often gets stuck there. Use your hands to smooth out these areas as you roll. For self-inflating Vango mats, the foam core might resist rolling slightly. Apply steady, firm pressure. The goal is to make the mattress as compact as possible. This makes it easier to store and transport.

Some Vango mats might have a foam layer that is more resistant. This requires consistent pressure. You can use your knees, hands, or even another person to help. The more air you remove manually, the smaller your packed mattress will be. This manual process is often enough for most Vango users. It works well for those without a pump or when electricity is not available.

### Accelerating Deflation with a Pump

While manual deflation works, using a pump can significantly speed up the process. Many Vango mattresses, especially their larger air beds, come with an integrated pump. Some Vango models might also include a small, external pump. Check your mattress specifications or the user manual to see if your Vango mattress has this feature. If it does, using it is often the quickest way to remove air.

To use an integrated pump for deflation, you usually need to switch its setting. Look for a deflate mode or a reverse airflow option. This will make the pump suck air out instead of pushing it in. Connect the pump nozzle to the mattress valve. Ensure a tight seal to prevent air from re-entering. Turn the pump on and let it do the work. The pump will quickly draw out most of the air.

If your Vango mattress does not have an integrated pump, you can use an external air pump. Most electric or battery-operated pumps have a deflate function. They often come with different nozzles. Choose the nozzle that fits snugly into your Vango mattress valve. Again, ensure the connection is secure. A loose connection will allow air to escape or re-enter. These pumps are powerful and will flatten your mattress very quickly.

Using a pump is especially helpful for large Vango air beds or those with internal structures. It ensures you remove almost all the air. This makes rolling and packing much easier. Even after pump deflation, a final manual roll might be needed. This helps to get out any last pockets of air. This ensures your Vango mattress is as compact as possible for storage. Always turn off the pump and quickly seal the valve after deflation is complete. This keeps the mattress from re-inflating.

### Mastering the Roll: Compacting Your Vango Mattress

Achieving a truly compact Vango mattress depends on a good rolling technique. Once you have removed most of the air, the way you fold and roll it matters. Start by laying your Vango mattress out flat. Ensure there are no wrinkles or creases. If your mattress is very wide, you might consider folding it lengthwise first. Fold it into a width that matches its storage bag. This step helps create a more manageable shape for rolling.

Begin rolling from the end furthest from the valve. Use your body weight or hands to press down firmly as you roll. The goal is to create a tight, even cylinder. As you roll, you will push any remaining air towards the open valve. Work slowly and methodically. Avoid rolling too quickly, as this can trap air. If you feel air building up, pause and press it out. You can also briefly unroll a section to release trapped air, then continue rolling.

As you get closer to the valve, apply more pressure. You want to force every last bit of air out through the opening. Once you reach the valve, quickly close it while maintaining pressure on the rolled mattress. This prevents air from sucking back in. Many Vango mattresses come with compression straps or an elastic band. Use these to secure the tightly rolled mattress. This keeps it from unrolling and allows for easy storage.

A well-rolled Vango mattress takes up minimal space. It also fits easily into its carry bag. Practicing this rolling technique makes a big difference. It ensures your mattress stays compact for travel or storage. This compaction helps protect the internal foam of self-inflating mats. It also keeps the overall structure of your Vango air bed safe.

### Common Issues and Solutions for Vango Mattress Deflation

You might encounter some small issues when deflating your Vango mattress. Knowing common problems and their solutions makes the process smoother. One issue is a stubborn valve. Sometimes, the valve can get stiff or sticky. Try twisting it gently while pulling. Applying a little warmth from your hands can also help loosen it. Avoid using excessive force, as this can damage the valve.

Another common problem is air re-entering the mattress. This happens if you do not close the valve quickly enough. For Vango mattresses with a Boston valve, the one-way flap usually prevents this. For other valve types, close the valve immediately after rolling and pushing out the air. If air re-enters, simply unroll a bit and re-roll, focusing on a swift valve closure. If you find your mattress always seems to re-inflate a bit, make sure the valve is completely sealed. Sometimes a small piece of dirt can prevent a full seal.

Remaining air pockets are also frustrating. This means your mattress is not as compact as it could be. This often happens if you roll too quickly or do not apply even pressure. The solution is to unroll the mattress completely and start over. Focus on a slower, firmer roll. Using your knees to apply consistent pressure across the width of the mattress helps. If you have an external pump, use its deflate function to remove stubborn air. Then, do a final manual roll.

Finally, small punctures or leaks can affect deflation. If your Vango mattress seems to lose air even when the valve is closed, you might have a tiny hole. This will not directly stop deflation. However, it means your mattress will not stay inflated properly during use. Check for bubbles in soapy water around the valve area or along seams. Patch any small holes before your next trip. This ensures proper function and easy deflation.

### Proper Storage Extends Vango Mattress Life

Once your Vango mattress is completely deflated and tightly rolled, proper storage is vital. Good storage habits extend the life of your mattress. Before storing, always make sure your Vango mattress is clean and completely dry. Any moisture left on the fabric can lead to mold or mildew growth. This can damage the mattress material. Use a damp cloth to wipe down any dirty spots. Let the mattress air dry thoroughly. This might take several hours, or even a full day.

For cleaning tips specific to air mattresses, you can refer to guides on [how to clean an air mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-mattress). If you have stubborn marks, learning [how to clean stains from a mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-from-a-mattress) can be helpful. Do not store the mattress damp. Even if it feels dry, a small amount of moisture can cause problems over time. Sunlight also degrades mattress materials. So, always dry it in a shady, well-ventilated area.

Store your Vango mattress in a cool, dry place. A garage, closet, or storage locker works well. Avoid areas with extreme temperature changes or high humidity. Attics or sheds can get very hot or very cold. These conditions can damage the PVC or fabric materials. Keep the mattress away from direct sunlight. UV rays can weaken the material over time. Also, keep it away from pests like rodents, which might chew through the fabric.

Use the original carry bag that came with your Vango mattress. These bags are designed to protect the mattress during storage and transport. If you do not have the original bag, use a sturdy duffel bag or a storage container. For self-inflating Vango mats, some recommend storing them unrolled with the valve open. This lets the foam recover. However, if space is limited, storing it rolled tightly is acceptable. Just let it inflate fully before your next use. This ensures your Vango mattress is ready for your next adventure.
