You ask yourself, "Why won't my LG dishwasher turn off?" This situation feels frustrating. You want your kitchen appliance to finish its job and let you carry on with your day.

When an LG dishwasher refuses to power down, it often points to a specific issue. This could be a sensor problem, a control board glitch, or a mechanical fault. We will explore the common reasons your LG dishwasher might get stuck. This guide offers clear steps to diagnose and fix these problems. We aim to help you get your dishwasher back to normal operation. You will learn about basic resets, common component failures, and smart diagnostic tools. Let us begin finding the solution for your tireless appliance.

### Takeaway

If your LG dishwasher won't turn off, start with these quick checks:

*   **Perform a hard reset:** Unplug the dishwasher or flip the circuit breaker for 5 minutes.
*   **Check the door latch:** Ensure the door closes fully and the latch engages properly.
*   **Inspect for error codes:** Look for flashing lights or codes on the display.
*   **Clear the control panel:** Press and hold the "Cancel" or "Drain" button for a few seconds.
*   **Listen for sounds:** Abnormal noises can indicate pump or motor issues.

### Clear Answer to the Main Query

Your LG dishwasher will not turn off because of a stuck cycle or a control malfunction. Common causes include a faulty door latch, issues with water level sensors, a problematic control board, or drainage problems. A simple power reset often resolves minor electronic glitches.

## Understanding the Dishwasher Cycle and Basic Resets

A dishwasher runs through a specific sequence of events. It fills, washes, drains, rinses, and dries. Each step depends on sensors and controls. If one part of this cycle fails, the dishwasher can get stuck. It might keep running or refuse to stop completely.

When your LG dishwasher won't turn off, a simple reset is often the first and best step. Electronic appliances can sometimes experience temporary glitches. A power cycle clears these errors. This action is similar to restarting a computer.

### Performing a Hard Reset

You can reset your LG dishwasher in a few ways. First, try pressing and holding the "Cancel" or "Drain" button. Hold it for about three to five seconds. This often forces the machine to stop its current cycle. It might then drain any remaining water.

If the button reset does not work, you need to cut power. Find your dishwasher's power cord. Unplug it from the wall outlet. Wait at least five minutes. This time allows the internal control board to fully discharge. After waiting, plug the dishwasher back in. Then, try to use it normally.

Sometimes, the power cord is hard to reach. In this case, go to your home's electrical panel. Find the circuit breaker labeled for your dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position. Leave it off for five minutes, then turn it back on. This provides a clean power cycle. This process can fix many minor issues.

## Door Latch and Switch Issues Preventing Shutdown

The door latch plays a critical role in your dishwasher's operation. It is a safety feature. The dishwasher will not run if the door is open. It also needs the door to stay latched throughout the cycle. If the latch does not close properly, or if the door switch is faulty, the dishwasher can believe the door is open. This prevents the cycle from ending or starting correctly. It might cause the machine to pause or run indefinitely.

A loose or broken door latch is a common culprit. Give the dishwasher door a firm push. Ensure it clicks shut. Sometimes, debris gets stuck in the latch mechanism. Check for any food particles or soap residue. Clean the latch area thoroughly with a damp cloth.

### Inspecting the Door Switch

Inside the door latch assembly sits a small switch. This switch tells the control board if the door is closed. If this switch malfunctions, the dishwasher will not receive the "door closed" signal. This can make the appliance run endlessly. It thinks the door is still open or insecure.

You can often test the door switch for continuity with a multimeter. This task requires some technical skill. If the switch shows no continuity when the door is closed, it is likely faulty. Replacing this switch often fixes the problem. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before inspecting internal components. Ensure your hands are dry and you use proper safety equipment.

## Water Level Sensors and Overflow Switch Malfunctions

Your LG dishwasher uses sensors to monitor water levels. These sensors ensure the correct amount of water enters the tub. They also prevent overfilling. If a water level sensor fails, the dishwasher might think it never has enough water. It will then continue to fill or run its wash cycle indefinitely. It waits for a signal that never comes.

The overflow switch is another critical safety device. This switch activates if water fills too high. It usually triggers the drain pump to prevent flooding. If the overflow switch gets stuck in the "on" position, the dishwasher might constantly try to drain. It will never finish its cycle. This can make the machine appear to run without end.

### Cleaning and Testing Sensors

Water level sensors can get dirty over time. Limescale, detergent residue, or food particles can build up. This buildup can provide inaccurate readings. Locate the water level sensor. It is often a float switch in the bottom of the tub. Clean it gently with a soft brush and warm, soapy water. Rinse it thoroughly.

Test the float switch mechanism. Make sure it moves freely up and down. If it sticks, lubricate it lightly or clear any obstructions. If cleaning does not help, the sensor might need replacement. A faulty water level sensor or overflow switch can lead to a cycle that never completes. It leads to frustration for the user.

## Heating Element and Thermistor Malfunctions

Dishwashers rely on heat for several parts of their cycle. They heat water for washing and sanitizing. They also use heat for the drying cycle. A working heating element is crucial for proper operation. If the heating element fails, the water may not reach the correct temperature. This can cause the dishwasher to extend its wash cycle. It waits for the water to heat up. It will continue waiting if the element is broken.

The thermistor works with the heating element. It is a temperature sensor. The thermistor measures the water temperature inside the dishwasher. It sends this information to the main control board. If the thermistor provides an incorrect reading, the control board gets confused. It might believe the water is too cold, even if it is hot. This makes the dishwasher keep heating, or waiting for heat, endlessly.

### Diagnosing Heating and Temperature Issues

You can often check the heating element for visible damage. Look for breaks or burnt spots. Use a multimeter to test for continuity. A lack of continuity means the element is broken. Similarly, you can test the thermistor's resistance. Its resistance changes with temperature. Compare your readings to the dishwasher's service manual. Incorrect resistance indicates a faulty thermistor.

Sometimes, the dishwasher enters an extended drying phase. This happens if the dishwasher does not sense proper drying. A faulty heating element or thermistor can also cause this. The machine simply keeps running the drying cycle indefinitely. This makes your LG dishwasher seem like it won't turn off. For similar issues with other appliances, sometimes components like lights can get stuck on too, as with a [GE oven light that won't turn off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-ge-oven-light-turn-off).

## Control Panel and Main Board Problems

The control panel is your interface with the dishwasher. It has buttons and a display. It sends your commands to the main control board. The main control board acts as the brain of the appliance. It processes all signals from sensors and user inputs. It then directs the dishwasher's various components. If either of these parts malfunctions, your LG dishwasher can exhibit erratic behavior. This includes getting stuck in a cycle or refusing to turn off.

A control panel can experience glitches. Buttons might become unresponsive. The display might show error codes or nothing at all. Sometimes, spilled liquid or wear and tear can damage the touch sensors or physical buttons. A simple reset (as discussed earlier) can clear minor control panel issues. If the problem persists, the panel might be faulty.

### Main Control Board Malfunctions

The main control board is more complex. It contains microprocessors and relays. These control all dishwasher functions. Power surges can damage it. Age and heat can also lead to component failure. A failing main control board might send wrong signals. It might fail to receive correct signals from sensors. This can cause the dishwasher to:

*   **Loop endlessly:** It repeats a section of the cycle.
*   **Freeze:** It stops responding to commands.
*   **Misinterpret conditions:** It thinks a cycle is still active.

Diagnosing a faulty control board often requires professional help. It is an expensive part. You should rule out all other possibilities first. Look for signs of burning or corrosion on the board itself. A professional technician can confirm a control board failure. They have specialized diagnostic tools.

## Drainage System Obstructions

A dishwasher must drain water effectively at various points in its cycle. This includes after the wash and rinse phases. It also drains completely at the end. If the drainage system has an obstruction, water stays in the tub. The dishwasher's sensors detect this water. It prevents the cycle from finishing. The machine will continue to pump, or try to pump, endlessly. It attempts to clear the water.

Common places for clogs include:

*   **The drain filter:** Located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.
*   **The air gap:** A small fixture on the countertop near the faucet.
*   **The drain hose:** The hose that connects the dishwasher to the sink drain or garbage disposal.
*   **The drain pump:** The motor that forces water out of the dishwasher.

### Clearing Drainage Path Issues

First, check the drain filter. Remove it and clean it thoroughly. Food particles, grease, and debris often accumulate here. Rinse it under running water. Ensure all holes are clear.

Next, inspect the air gap. Remove the cover on your countertop. Clear out any clogs inside. These can be surprising. Then, examine the drain hose. Look for kinks or blockages. Disconnect it from the sink drain or garbage disposal. Check inside with a flashlight. Clear any obstructions you find. If you have a garbage disposal, make sure its knockout plug is removed. This plug is for dishwashers and is critical. For specific problems with your LG dishwasher not draining, you can find more detailed solutions.

Finally, the drain pump might be faulty. If the pump runs but no water drains, it could be clogged or broken. You might hear a humming sound, but no water movement. Clearing a pump blockage can be tricky. Sometimes, small items like broken glass or cherry pits get stuck. This often requires professional assistance.

## LG Smart Diagnosis and Error Codes

LG dishwashers often feature Smart Diagnosis technology. This system helps you troubleshoot problems using your smartphone. If your LG dishwasher won't turn off, it might be displaying an error code. These codes point to specific issues. The Smart Diagnosis feature can help you understand these codes. It can also provide guidance on how to fix the problem.

To use Smart Diagnosis:
1.  **Download the LG SmartThinQ app:** Install it on your smartphone.
2.  **Activate Smart Diagnosis on the dishwasher:** Follow the instructions in your owner's manual. This usually involves pressing a specific button combination.
3.  **Hold your phone to the dishwasher:** Place your phone's microphone near the Smart Diagnosis icon. The dishwasher will transmit a series of beeps.
4.  **Receive the diagnosis:** The app will interpret the beeps. It will then tell you the problem. It often suggests a solution.

Error codes provide valuable clues. For example, a common code like "OE" means a draining issue. A "FE" code indicates an overfill error. Understanding these codes is the first step towards a fix. Consult your LG dishwasher's owner's manual for a full list of error codes. It explains what each code means.

Even without Smart Diagnosis, pay attention to any flashing lights or codes on the dishwasher's display. These are not random. They are the machine's way of communicating a problem. Write down the code. Then, look it up in your manual or online. This can save you time and money. It helps you pinpoint the exact reason your LG dishwasher won't turn off. For issues where an appliance simply won't stop, like a [gas oven that won't turn off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-gas-oven-turn-off), similar diagnostic approaches can be beneficial.
