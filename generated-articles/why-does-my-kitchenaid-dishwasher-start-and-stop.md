## Fix Your Kitchenaid Dishwasher: Why It Starts and Stops

It is frustrating when your Kitchenaid dishwasher starts and stops in the middle of a wash cycle. This common issue stops your dishes from getting clean. A dishwasher that starts and stops wastes water and electricity. More importantly, it signals a problem that needs your attention.

Many factors can cause your Kitchenaid dishwasher to start and stop. These range from simple power issues to complex component failures. I know how important a working dishwasher is for daily life. This guide will help you understand the main reasons behind this problem. We will also provide clear steps to diagnose and fix the issue. You will learn to identify the cause and work towards a solution.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Power First:** Ensure the dishwasher has consistent power, check the breaker and wall outlet.
*   **Inspect the Door Latch:** A secure door is vital for cycle operation; test the latch mechanism.
*   **Verify Water Supply:** Ensure proper water flow and pressure into the dishwasher.
*   **Clear Drain System:** Remove any clogs from the filter, drain hose, or pump.
*   **Examine Internal Parts:** Look for faulty sensors, a bad control board, or tripped thermal fuses.
*   **Safety First:** Disconnect power before performing any inspections or repairs.

A Kitchenaid dishwasher that starts and stops often indicates an interruption in its power supply, a problem with the door latch, insufficient water intake, or a drainage issue. Internal component failures like a faulty sensor, control board, or thermal fuse can also cause this behavior, signaling the need for troubleshooting.

### Understanding Your Kitchenaid Dishwasher's Cycles

Your Kitchenaid dishwasher runs through specific stages during a wash cycle. It needs to complete each step to move to the next. These steps include filling with water, washing, draining, and drying. A problem at any stage can cause the dishwasher to stop.

If the dishwasher starts and then stops, it means something is interrupting this flow. The machine's control system expects certain conditions. It needs enough water. It needs to detect the door is fully closed. It needs to drain water properly.

When these conditions are not met, the dishwasher stops as a safety measure or due to a fault. It might pause, try again, or shut down completely. Knowing the normal cycle helps you pinpoint where the interruption occurs. This understanding makes troubleshooting easier. We will explore each potential failure point in detail.

### Common Power Supply and Electrical Issues

A Kitchenaid dishwasher needs a steady power supply to run its cycles without interruption. If the power supply is unstable, the dishwasher will likely start and stop. This happens because the machine briefly loses power. It then tries to restart when power returns.

First, always check the power source. This is the simplest fix and often resolves the problem. Your dishwasher pulls a lot of electricity. Power issues can cause serious problems for its operation. Addressing electrical problems quickly protects your appliance.

#### Tripped Breakers and Outlet Problems

Start by checking your home's circuit breaker panel. A dishwasher uses a lot of power. The breaker may trip if it pulls too much current or has a short. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. If it is in the "off" or middle position, reset it by flipping it fully "off" and then back "on."

Next, check the electrical outlet. Sometimes, the outlet itself can fail. Plug another appliance, like a small lamp, into the same outlet. If the lamp does not turn on, the outlet has no power. This means the problem is with the outlet or the wiring to it. You might need an electrician to fix a dead outlet.

#### Faulty Power Cords and Connections

Inspect the dishwasher's power cord. A damaged cord cannot deliver consistent power. Look for cuts, frays, or burn marks. A cord can get damaged if it is pinched behind the dishwasher. If the cord is damaged, it needs replacement. This is a job for a qualified repair person.

Also, check the connection at the wall outlet. Make sure the plug fits snugly. A loose plug can cause intermittent power. This makes the dishwasher start and stop. Tighten any loose connections. Ensure the outlet provides sufficient voltage. Sometimes, older outlets or circuits cannot handle the dishwasher's power needs. This can lead to power fluctuations.

### Door Latch and Switch Malfunctions

The door latch on your Kitchenaid dishwasher is a safety device. It ensures the door is closed and locked before the wash cycle begins. If the door latch does not engage properly, the dishwasher will not start or will stop mid-cycle. The machine's control system needs to confirm the door is secure.

A faulty door latch or switch is a very common cause of intermittent operation. The latch mechanism can wear out over time. The switch itself might become defective. This prevents the dishwasher from receiving the signal that the door is closed.

#### Inspecting the Door Latch

Open your dishwasher door and examine the latch mechanism. Look for any visible damage. The latch typically has a hook that catches onto a strike on the dishwasher frame. Check if the hook is broken or bent. Ensure no food particles or debris block the latch's path.

Clean the area around the latch. Use a damp cloth to wipe away grime. Sometimes, built-up residue prevents the latch from fully engaging. Gently try to open and close the door a few times. Listen for a clear click when the latch engages. If it feels loose or does not click, the latch might be the problem.

#### Testing the Door Latch Switch

Behind the latch mechanism is a small switch. This switch tells the control board if the door is closed. You often need to remove the outer door panel to access it. Disconnect power to the dishwasher first. Use a multimeter to test the switch for continuity.

When the door is closed, the switch should show continuity. When the door is open, it should show no continuity. If the switch does not change state, it is defective. A faulty door latch switch means the dishwasher never gets the "all clear" signal. This will cause it to start and stop, or not start at all. Replacing the switch usually solves this problem.

### Water Inlet Valve and Fill Issues

Your Kitchenaid dishwasher needs a proper water supply to operate. If it does not get enough water, or if water pressure is low, the dishwasher may start and stop. The machine's sensors detect water levels. If the sensors do not register enough water, the cycle will pause or halt.

Problems with the water inlet valve are also common. This valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. If it is clogged or faulty, water flow will be restricted. This will prevent the dishwasher from completing its wash cycle.

#### Checking Water Supply and Inlet Hose

First, check your home's main water supply. Ensure the water valve to the dishwasher is fully open. This valve is usually located under the sink or behind the dishwasher. A partially closed valve will restrict water flow. Next, inspect the water inlet hose. This hose connects the water supply to the dishwasher.

Look for any kinks or bends in the hose. A kinked hose restricts water flow. Also, check for debris in the inlet hose screen. There is a small filter screen where the hose connects to the inlet valve. Shut off the water supply before disconnecting the hose. Clean any debris from the screen. A clogged screen significantly reduces water entering the dishwasher.

#### Diagnosing a Faulty Water Inlet Valve

The water inlet valve itself can fail. If the valve does not open fully, the dishwasher gets insufficient water. If it does not close fully, the dishwasher might overfill or leak. You can often hear a buzzing sound from the valve when it tries to open. If you do not hear anything, or the buzzing is weak, the valve may be faulty.

To test the valve, you need a multimeter. Disconnect the dishwasher from power. Disconnect the electrical wires from the valve. Test the valve's solenoid for continuity. If there is no continuity, the valve is broken. A broken water inlet valve needs replacement. This issue stops the dishwasher from filling, thus preventing the cycle from continuing.

### Drainage Problems and Clogs

A Kitchenaid dishwasher must drain water properly after each wash or rinse phase. If the water cannot drain, the dishwasher will stop. It cannot proceed to the next cycle stage if water remains inside. This is a common reason for a dishwasher to start and stop.

Drainage problems often stem from clogs. Food particles, grease, or other debris can accumulate. These blockages can occur in various parts of the drain system. Clearing these clogs usually resolves the stopping issue.

#### Clogged Filters and Drain Hose

Begin by checking the dishwasher's filters. Most Kitchenaid dishwashers have a multi-part filter system at the bottom. This includes a coarse filter and a fine filter. Remove these filters and clean them thoroughly under running water. Use a brush to remove all food debris. Reinstall them correctly. A clogged filter severely impairs drainage.

Next, inspect the drain hose. This hose connects the dishwasher to your home's drain line. Look for kinks or bends in the hose. Straighten any kinks you find. The hose can also get clogged with food particles. Disconnect the hose from both ends if possible. Check for blockages inside the hose. Use a long brush or snake tool to clear any obstructions. Ensuring free flow through the hose is vital. A similar issue can cause water to remain at the bottom of the dishwasher: [Why Does My Kitchenaid Dishwasher Have Water In The Bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom).

#### Inspecting the Drain Pump

If the filters and hose are clear, the problem might be with the drain pump. The drain pump removes water from the dishwasher. If it is faulty, water will not drain, and the cycle will stop. You might hear a humming sound, but no water moves. Or you might hear nothing at all.

Accessing the drain pump often requires removing the lower spray arm and pump housing. Always disconnect power before doing this. Check for any foreign objects like broken glass or small plastic pieces lodged in the pump impeller. These objects can jam the pump. If the impeller is clear and the pump still does not work, the pump motor might be bad. A faulty drain pump needs replacement. This is a critical component for proper cycle completion.

### Faulty Sensors and Control Board Problems

Modern Kitchenaid dishwashers rely on various sensors to monitor conditions. These sensors track water temperature, turbidity (how dirty the water is), and water levels. If a sensor fails, it sends incorrect information to the control board. This can cause the dishwasher to stop running.

The control board acts as the dishwasher's brain. It processes information from sensors and sends commands to other components. If the control board malfunctions, it can send wrong commands. This leads to erratic behavior, like starting and stopping.

#### Troubleshooting Temperature and Turbidity Sensors

The temperature sensor, or thermistor, ensures the water reaches the correct temperature. If it fails, the dishwasher might stop heating. It will then pause or stop the cycle. The turbidity sensor checks how clean the water is. If it detects too much dirt, it might extend the cycle. If it malfunctions, it could cause the cycle to stop prematurely, thinking the water is clean enough or too dirty to continue.

You can often test these sensors with a multimeter. Disconnect the dishwasher from power first. The temperature sensor should show a resistance change with temperature. The turbidity sensor sends a signal based on light detection. If either sensor gives inconsistent readings or no readings, it is likely faulty. Replacing a bad sensor helps the control board make correct decisions.

#### Signs of a Failing Control Board

A failing control board can exhibit many symptoms. Your dishwasher might stop mid-cycle without any clear reason. Buttons might not respond correctly. Programs might not run as expected. The display might show error codes that do not correspond to any apparent problem. Sometimes, the dishwasher simply acts erratically.

There is no easy way to "fix" a control board. If you suspect the control board is the issue, it usually requires replacement. This is an expensive part. Rule out all other simpler causes first. Check all wire connections to the control board. Ensure they are secure. A loose connection can mimic a faulty board. If replacement is necessary, consider if the cost is worth it versus buying a new appliance, especially for older models. You might also notice your Kitchenaid dishwasher running for an unusually long time, which could also point to a control board issue or sensor problem: [Why Does My Kitchenaid Dishwasher Run For 4 Hours](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-run-for-4-hours).

### Overheating and Thermal Fuse Protection

Your Kitchenaid dishwasher has safety features to prevent damage from overheating. One such feature is the thermal fuse. This small component acts as a safety switch. If the temperature inside the dishwasher rises too high, the thermal fuse blows. This cuts power to the dishwasher. The dishwasher will stop completely to prevent a fire or further damage.

Once a thermal fuse blows, it must be replaced. It does not reset itself. A blown thermal fuse means there was an underlying overheating problem. You must find the cause of the overheating. Simply replacing the fuse without addressing the root cause will lead to the new fuse blowing again.

#### Understanding the Thermal Fuse

The thermal fuse is typically located near the control board or heating element. It is a one-time safety device. When its temperature threshold is exceeded, an internal wire melts. This breaks the electrical circuit. This action immediately stops the dishwasher. Its purpose is to protect the appliance and your home.

You can test a thermal fuse with a multimeter. With power disconnected, remove the fuse and check for continuity. A good fuse will show continuity. A blown fuse will show no continuity. If it shows no continuity, it needs replacement. Remember, replacing the fuse is only part of the solution. You must also identify why it blew in the first place.

#### Causes of Overheating and Shutoff

Several factors can cause a Kitchenaid dishwasher to overheat. A faulty heating element is a common culprit. If the heating element stays on too long or draws too much power, it can cause high temperatures. A problem with the thermostat can also lead to overheating. The thermostat should regulate the heater. If it fails, the heater might run continuously.

Poor circulation or blocked vents can also trap heat. Ensure the dishwasher is not too tightly packed. Check that the vent pathways are clear. Issues with the drying cycle might also contribute. If the drying fan fails, heat can build up. Address the overheating cause before operating the dishwasher again. This ensures safety and prevents future thermal fuse failures.
