## Can You Wash Converse In The Washer Machine Safely?

Have you ever looked down at your favorite pair of Converse sneakers, covered in dirt and wondering if there's an easier way to bring them back to life? I have, many times. The classic canvas and rubber design of Converse makes them incredibly popular, but also prone to getting dirty quickly. Hand-scrubbing can be tedious and time-consuming. This often leads people to ask: "Can you wash Converse in the washer machine?"

Yes, you can absolutely wash Converse in the washing machine. It is a common and effective way to clean them. However, proper preparation and careful execution are essential to protect your shoes and your machine. We will explore the steps to successfully machine wash your Converse. This guide covers everything from pre-cleaning to drying, ensuring your beloved sneakers come out looking fresh without damage.

### Takeaway

*   **Prepare Thoroughly:** Remove laces and insoles, and brush off loose dirt before washing.
*   **Protect Your Shoes:** Place Converse in a mesh laundry bag with towels to cushion them.
*   **Use Gentle Settings:** Opt for a cold water, delicate cycle with a low spin speed.
*   **Choose Mild Detergent:** Use a small amount of liquid, gentle detergent.
*   **Air Dry Completely:** Always air dry your Converse; avoid the dryer to prevent shrinking or damage.

You can wash Converse in the washer machine, but you must follow specific steps to avoid damage. Use a gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. Always air dry your Converse to prevent heat-related issues like shrinking or deforming. Preparing the shoes properly ensures the best results.

### Preparing Your Converse for the Washing Machine

Before tossing your dirty Converse into the washing machine, a little preparation goes a long way. This initial step helps protect both your shoes and your appliance. It also ensures a more effective clean. Skipping this part can lead to poorer results or even damage.

First, remove the laces from your Converse. Laces can get tangled during the wash cycle, potentially damaging themselves or other items in the machine. They also tend to not get as clean when left on the shoes. You can wash the laces separately by hand or place them in a small mesh bag with the shoes.

Next, take out any removable insoles. Some insoles are made of materials that may not hold up well in a washing machine. They can also absorb too much water, making drying difficult. Cleaning insoles by hand with a damp cloth and mild soap is often better. Let them air dry completely before putting them back into the shoes.

Finally, brush off any loose dirt, mud, or debris from the shoes. Use a dry brush or an old toothbrush for this step. This prevents dirt from clogging your washing machine's drain or settling back onto the shoes during the wash cycle. Paying attention to the rubber toe caps and sides is helpful, as dirt often builds up there. For stubborn grime, you might need to scrape it off carefully. Properly pre-cleaning helps the washing machine focus on deeper stains.

### Choosing the Right Detergent and Water Temperature

Selecting the correct detergent and water temperature is important when you wash Converse in the washer machine. Using the wrong products or settings can lead to color fading, material damage, or incomplete cleaning. We aim for fresh, clean shoes without compromising their integrity.

Always use a mild, liquid laundry detergent. Powder detergents may not dissolve fully in cold water and can leave a residue on your shoes. Harsh detergents or those containing bleach can strip colors from canvas Converse, especially darker shades. For white Converse, a small amount of oxygen-based whitener (non-chlorine bleach) can brighten them, but always test it on a small, hidden area first. Avoid using fabric softener, as it can leave a film on the canvas and affect its texture. I usually opt for a free-and-clear detergent, as it is gentle on fabrics. When I clean my [all white Converse](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-all-white-converse), I might add a little extra boost for brightness, but only a gentle one.

Water temperature is another key factor. Always choose cold water when washing Converse. Hot water can cause the canvas to shrink, deform the rubber components, or loosen the adhesive that holds the shoe together. Cold water is effective enough for cleaning dirt and grime without posing these risks. It also helps to preserve the color of your shoes. A cold wash also uses less energy, making it an eco-friendly choice. This simple decision protects your shoes from unnecessary stress. Whether you are washing vibrant blue Converse or classic black ones, cold water is the safest bet for maintaining their shape and color. For tips on keeping your [white Converse shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-converse-shoes), using cold water is also a key recommendation.

### Protecting Your Converse During the Wash Cycle

Putting your Converse directly into the washing machine without protection can lead to problems. The shoes can bang against the drum, causing damage to both the shoes and the machine. They can also get tangled with other items. Proper protection ensures a safe and effective wash.

Place your Converse inside a mesh laundry bag. These bags are designed to protect delicate items during washing. They prevent shoes from tumbling freely and hitting the machine's interior walls. If you do not have a mesh bag, a pillowcase tied securely at the top can serve as a good substitute. Make sure the bag is large enough to comfortably hold both shoes without cramming them in. This simple step cushions the shoes. It helps to keep their shape during the wash cycle.

To further cushion the impact, add a few old towels to the wash load. These towels act as a buffer, preventing the shoes from banging around too much. They also help balance the load in the washing machine, which can reduce noise and vibration. Do not use new or dark-colored towels, as their dyes might transfer to your shoes. Light-colored, older towels are best for this purpose. I always throw in a couple of my worn-out bath towels when I decide to [clean shoes in the washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer). This simple method makes a big difference in protecting both the shoes and the machine. It is similar to how one might [clean sneakers in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-sneakers-in-the-washing-machine) for best results.

### The Best Washing Machine Settings for Converse

Using the correct washing machine settings is essential for a safe and effective clean when you wash Converse in the washer machine. Incorrect settings can lead to damage, premature wear, or poor cleaning results. The goal is to be gentle while still getting rid of the dirt.

Choose the "delicate" or "gentle" cycle on your washing machine. These cycles use slower agitation and a reduced spin speed. This minimizes stress on the shoes' fabric and structure. Avoid heavy-duty or normal cycles, as their vigorous action can be too harsh for canvas and rubber. The less aggressive tumbling helps to maintain the shape of your Converse. It also prevents the rubber parts from cracking or separating from the canvas.

Always select cold water for the wash. As discussed earlier, cold water prevents shrinking and adhesive breakdown. Pair this with a low spin speed. A high spin speed can put excessive strain on the shoes and cause them to lose their shape. A lower spin setting will leave the shoes wetter, but this is preferable to potential damage. You can always squeeze out excess water by hand later. For front-loading machines, make sure to check the specific settings, as some models have dedicated shoe cycles. If you have a [front load washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washer-machine-front-loader), its gentle tumbling action is often ideal for shoes. I always make sure to set my machine to the absolute gentlest cycle available when washing my shoes.

Regarding load size, wash your Converse as a small, separate load. This ensures they have enough space to move freely within the protective mesh bag. Overloading the machine can prevent proper cleaning and increase the risk of damage from inadequate cushioning. It is best to wash only one or two pairs of shoes at a time, along with the cushioning towels. This ensures that the shoes get thoroughly cleaned without being crushed.

### Drying Your Converse Safely After Washing

After you successfully wash Converse in the washer machine, the drying process is just as important as the washing itself. Improper drying can lead to shrinkage, odor, or mold growth. You want your freshly cleaned shoes to be completely dry and ready to wear without issues.

Always air dry your Converse. Never put them in a clothes dryer. The high heat from a dryer can cause the canvas to shrink significantly. It can also melt or warp the rubber soles and toe caps. The heat can also weaken the adhesive that holds the shoe together, leading to parts separating. Even low heat settings are risky for shoes. Patience is key during the drying phase. This step is critical for preserving the shoe's shape and lifespan.

To speed up the air-drying process and help maintain the shoe's shape, stuff your Converse with paper towels or old newspapers. This absorbs excess moisture from the inside. Replace the paper as it becomes damp. This trick also helps to prevent the shoes from collapsing and keeps their original form. Avoid using colored newspaper if your shoes are white, as the ink could transfer.

Place your stuffed Converse in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or intense heat. A shaded spot outdoors on a warm, breezy day is ideal. Indoors, place them near a fan or in a room with good air circulation. Depending on humidity levels, drying can take 24 to 48 hours. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them or storing them away. Wearing damp shoes can cause odors and discomfort. It can also lead to mold or mildew growth inside the shoe.

### What Not to Do When Washing Converse in the Washer Machine

While washing Converse in the washer machine can be effective, certain actions can ruin your shoes. Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to do. These precautions help extend the life of your beloved sneakers.

Do not use hot water. Hot water is a major culprit for shrinking canvas and damaging adhesives. The heat can also warp the rubber soles and toe caps, causing them to lose their shape or crack. Always stick to cold water for washing your Converse. This preserves their material integrity and prevents color fading. I learned this the hard way with a favorite pair once; they shrunk a size!

Avoid using bleach, especially on colored Converse. Chlorine bleach can aggressively strip the color from canvas, leaving permanent splotches or dulling the vibrant shades. Even on white Converse, too much bleach can weaken the canvas fibers over time, making them brittle. If you need to whiten white Converse, opt for a color-safe oxygen bleach or a mixture of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide for spot cleaning before washing. For specific methods on [cleaning black Converse](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-black-converse), avoiding bleach is paramount to maintain their dark hue. Also, be gentle with the rubber parts; harsh chemicals can affect them too, so consider how you [clean Converse shoes rubber](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-converse-shoes-rubber) components.

Never put your Converse in a dryer. This is perhaps the biggest mistake people make. The intense heat of a dryer will almost certainly shrink the canvas and deform the rubber parts. It can also cause the glue holding the shoes together to break down, leading to separation of the sole from the upper. Air drying is the only safe method. Be patient and allow your shoes to dry naturally. This protects their structure and extends their wearability.

Do not use harsh scrubbing tools directly on the canvas, especially not in the machine. While a soft brush for pre-treatment is fine, avoid anything that could abrade the fabric. The washing machine's agitation, even on a gentle cycle, is enough to clean the canvas. Excessive scrubbing can damage the fibers. This applies to special types as well; for instance, you should never put [leather Converse](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leather-converse) in the washing machine at all, as water and machine agitation will severely damage the leather.

### Hand Washing vs. Machine Washing Converse: When to Choose Which

While washing Converse in the washer machine is convenient, it is not always the best solution. Sometimes, hand washing is a better choice, depending on the shoe's condition, material, or specific needs. Understanding when to choose each method helps preserve your Converse and keeps them looking their best.

Hand washing is ideal for lightly soiled Converse or for shoes made of delicate materials. If your shoes only have a few scuff marks or a small amount of dirt, a quick hand wash can be more efficient and gentler than a full machine cycle. Hand washing allows for more precise cleaning. You can target specific stains without exposing the entire shoe to excessive water or agitation. This method is also suitable for Converse with special embellishments, embroidery, or custom paint, which might not withstand machine washing. For instance, if you have a pair with intricate designs, hand cleaning protects those details.

You should opt for hand washing if your Converse are very old or fragile. The constant tumbling in a washing machine, even on a delicate cycle, can put stress on weakened seams or brittle rubber. If you are worried about the shoe falling apart, a gentle hand wash gives you more control. This is also the preferred method for any non-canvas Converse, such as leather or suede versions, which should never go into a washing machine. Hand washing often involves using a soft brush, mild soap, and warm water, focusing on dirty areas. If you lack access to a washing machine, [washing clothes without a washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-clothes-without-a-washer) can extend to hand washing your shoes effectively.

Machine washing is perfect for heavily soiled canvas Converse. When your shoes are covered in mud, dirt, or have deep-set stains, the machine offers a more thorough and less labor-intensive clean. It is great for removing overall grime and refreshing the entire shoe. For standard canvas Converse that are regularly worn and get quite dirty, the washing machine provides a convenient and effective solution. It saves time and effort compared to intensive hand scrubbing. Just remember to follow all the preparation and drying steps to ensure a successful outcome. Machine washing is a powerful tool when used correctly for the right type of Converse.

### FAQ Section

**What type of Converse should not go in the washing machine?**

**How do I remove tough stains before washing?**
Pre-treat tough stains before machine washing. You can use a stain remover stick or a mixture of baking soda and a little water to form a paste. Apply it directly to the stain and let it sit for 15-30 minutes before putting the shoes in the washer. This helps loosen the grime for better removal.
