## Washing Keds: Can You Machine Wash Them?

Keeping your favorite Keds sneakers clean can feel like a challenge. Dirt and grime build up quickly, especially on white canvas shoes. Many people wonder about the best way to restore their Keds. A common question arises: can Keds be machine washed safely?

Yes, you can machine wash Keds. Many Keds styles, especially those made of canvas, handle the washing machine well. Proper preparation and gentle settings are essential. This method helps your shoes look fresh and clean again. This article guides you through the entire process. We cover everything from pre-treatment to drying. Follow these steps to keep your Keds looking their best for a long time.

### Takeaway

*   **Prepare Keds:** Remove laces and insoles. Brush off loose dirt.
*   **Spot Treat Stains:** Apply mild cleaner to visible marks before washing.
*   **Protect Shoes:** Place Keds in a mesh laundry bag. This protects them and your washing machine.
*   **Use Cold Water:** Always wash Keds with cold water. Hot water can damage the glue and fabric.
*   **Choose Gentle Cycle:** Select a delicate or gentle wash cycle. This prevents harsh agitation.
*   **Air Dry Only:** Never put Keds in a dryer. Air drying keeps their shape and prevents shrinking.

**Can Keds Be Machine Washed? A Quick Answer**

Yes, you can machine wash Keds. Most canvas Keds models are suitable for machine washing. Use cold water and a delicate cycle. Always remove laces and insoles first. Place the shoes in a mesh laundry bag. Air dry them completely afterwards.

## Understanding Keds Materials: What Makes Them Washable?

Keds sneakers are famous for their simple design and comfortable feel. The brand primarily uses canvas for its classic styles. This material is durable and breathable. Canvas is a woven fabric, usually made from cotton. It responds well to water and mild detergents.

The rubber sole is another key component of Keds shoes. Rubber handles water exposure without major issues. However, excessive heat can cause rubber to warp or detach. The glues used to attach the sole can also weaken with high temperatures. This is why cold water is always recommended for washing Keds. Knowing the materials helps you understand the best cleaning approach for your shoes.

Keds also include laces and sometimes removable insoles. These parts often need separate treatment. Laces can get tangled or not clean well inside shoes. Insoles absorb sweat and odor, requiring thorough cleaning. Understanding these elements ensures a complete and safe wash. Proper care extends the life of your beloved sneakers. My Keds have lasted years because I pay attention to these details.

Some Keds models might include different materials like leather or suede. These materials are generally *not* suitable for machine washing. Leather can crack, and suede can get ruined by water. Always check the care tag or material composition of your specific Keds. Most classic canvas Keds are fine for a machine wash. This material makes them a practical choice for everyday wear and easy cleaning.

## Preparation is Key: Steps Before Machine Washing Keds

Proper preparation sets your Keds up for a successful machine wash. Skipping these steps can lead to less effective cleaning or even damage. My own experience shows that a little pre-wash effort makes a big difference. This process makes sure your shoes come out as clean as possible. It also protects both your shoes and your washing machine.

First, remove the laces from your Keds. Laces can tangle in the washing machine drum. They might not get clean if they stay on the shoes. You can wash laces separately by hand or place them in a small mesh bag. Take out any removable insoles as well. Insoles can retain moisture and odors. Cleaning them separately allows for a more thorough wash. Many people wonder, "Can you machine wash Keds without this step?" Yes, but the results are better when you remove these items.

Next, brush off any loose dirt or debris from the shoes. Use a dry brush or an old toothbrush for this task. Pay attention to the soles and seams. Removing caked-on mud or dirt prevents it from spreading during the wash cycle. This step significantly improves the final cleanliness of your Keds. It also keeps your washing machine cleaner. This pre-treatment prepares the canvas for deeper cleaning.

Finally, consider pre-treating any visible stains. Apply a small amount of mild detergent or a stain remover directly to the stained areas. Let it sit for about 15-30 minutes before washing. Gently scrub the area with a soft brush. This helps lift stubborn marks that a regular wash might not remove. This careful preparation is crucial for getting your shoes truly spotless.

## The Machine Washing Process: Best Settings for Keds

Once your Keds are ready, placing them in the washing machine requires careful attention. The right settings are vital to protect the shoes. I always follow these guidelines for my own canvas sneakers. These steps ensure a gentle yet effective clean. They help prevent damage to the fabric and glue.

Start by placing your Keds in a mesh laundry bag. If you do not have a laundry bag, an old pillowcase works well. Tie the pillowcase closed. This bag protects the shoes from harsh banging against the machine's drum. It also prevents the shoes from getting tangled with other items. This protection is important for preserving the shoe's structure.

Add a few old towels to the washing machine with your Keds. The towels act as a buffer. They reduce the noise and impact of the shoes tumbling around. This helps cushion the shoes during the wash cycle. It also balances the load in the machine. Using towels helps avoid damage to your machine from shoes hitting the sides.

Use cold water for washing your Keds. Hot water can shrink the canvas. It can also weaken the adhesive that holds the soles. Cold water is gentler on the materials. It helps maintain the shoe's shape and integrity. Select a gentle or delicate wash cycle. This cycle uses less agitation, which is perfect for sneakers. Avoid any heavy-duty or strong wash cycles.

Choose a mild laundry detergent. Use about half the amount you would for a regular load of clothes. Harsh detergents can strip the canvas fabric. They can also leave residues. Avoid using bleach, even on white Keds. Bleach can cause yellowing and weaken the fabric over time. For extra stubborn odors, a cup of white vinegar added to the wash cycle can help. Following these steps helps you [wash Keds in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-keds-in-the-washing-machine) effectively.

## Drying Your Keds Safely: Air Drying for Longevity

After the wash cycle finishes, the drying process is just as important as the wash itself. Improper drying can ruin your Keds, undoing all your careful cleaning work. I cannot stress enough the importance of air drying. This step keeps your Keds in good shape and looking new. It prevents shrinking and material damage.

**Never put your Keds in a clothes dryer.** The high heat from a dryer is very damaging to sneakers. It can cause the canvas to shrink. It also weakens the glue that attaches the soles. The rubber parts can warp or crack. This will deform the shoes. The heat can also cause yellowing on white canvas Keds. This is a common mistake people make. Avoiding the dryer helps your Keds last longer.

The best way to dry Keds is by air drying them. Take them out of the mesh bag immediately after washing. Remove any excess water by gently pressing them with a clean towel. Reshape them slightly if needed. You can stuff the toes with white paper towels or clean, dry cloths. This helps absorb moisture from the inside. It also helps maintain their original shape. Avoid using colored paper or newspaper, as the ink can transfer to the wet shoes.

Place your Keds in a well-ventilated area. A spot with good airflow, away from direct sunlight, is ideal. Direct sunlight can fade the canvas color. It can also cause the rubber to dry out prematurely. You can hang them by their laces on a clothesline. You can also place them on a drying rack. Turn them occasionally to ensure even drying. Ensure the shoes are completely dry before wearing them again. This can take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours, depending on humidity. Wearing damp shoes can lead to unpleasant odors and mildew growth. This careful drying process preserves your Keds.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains: Pre-Treatment and Spot Cleaning

Some stains need more attention than a regular machine wash. Dirt, grass, or food spills can leave marks. Knowing how to pre-treat these stubborn stains makes a big difference. This method ensures your Keds look spotless. I always tackle tough spots before the main wash. This approach gives the best results.

For general dirt and mud stains, let the mud dry completely first. Then, gently brush off the dry mud with a stiff brush or old toothbrush. Applying water to wet mud can spread the stain. After brushing, you can apply a mild stain remover. Work it into the canvas with a cloth or soft brush. Allow it to sit for a few minutes before washing. This breaks down the remaining dirt.

Grease or oil stains require immediate action. Blot the excess grease with a paper towel. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder over the stain. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. The powder absorbs the oil. Brush off the powder. Then, apply a small amount of liquid dish soap to the stain. Gently scrub it with a brush. Rinse the spot with cold water. Then proceed with machine washing.

Grass stains can be tricky. Apply an enzyme-based laundry pre-treater to the stain. Let it soak for 15-30 minutes. Enzymes help break down the chlorophyll in grass. Gently scrub the area. Alternatively, a paste of baking soda and a little water can also work. Apply the paste, let it sit, then scrub before washing. This targets the stain effectively.

For scuff marks on the rubber soles, a magic eraser or a mixture of baking soda and water works wonders. Rub the paste onto the rubber parts. Use an old toothbrush or a cloth. This gently lifts scuff marks without damaging the rubber. Pay close attention to these details for truly clean Keds. This detailed spot cleaning prepares your [Keds for washing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-keds-in-the-washing-machine) effectively.

## Maintaining Freshness: Post-Wash Care and Storage

Cleaning your Keds is only part of the battle. Proper post-wash care and storage help maintain their freshness. This prevents future issues like odors or yellowing. It extends the life of your shoes. I follow these steps to keep my Keds ready for wear. This helps them stay looking great for longer.

Once your Keds are completely dry, you can reinsert the laces and insoles. Ensure everything is thoroughly dry before putting them back together. Damp insoles can become breeding grounds for bacteria. If your insoles still have an odor, sprinkle them with baking soda. Let them sit overnight. Then brush off the powder. This helps absorb any lingering smells. You can also buy cedar shoe trees. They absorb moisture and maintain shoe shape.

To keep your Keds smelling fresh between washes, consider using deodorizing inserts. These small pouches or sprays absorb moisture and neutralize odors. Store your Keds in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or humid environments. These conditions can cause material breakdown or mildew growth. Shoe boxes or a dedicated shoe rack are good storage options. Proper storage is a simple step to preserve their condition.

Regular rotation of your Keds with other shoes also helps. This allows your Keds to air out between wears. It reduces moisture buildup. Frequent wear without airing can lead to faster accumulation of dirt and odor. I try to avoid wearing the same pair of shoes every day. This extends the life of all my footwear.

The frequency of washing depends on how often you wear your Keds. For everyday wear, washing every 1-2 months might be necessary. For occasional use, washing every 3-6 months is usually sufficient. Over-washing can wear down the fabric. Judge based on their appearance and smell. This balanced approach keeps your Keds clean without over-stressing the material. This care ensures your [Keds last longer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-machine-wash-keds).

## Hand Washing Keds: An Alternative Method

Machine washing is convenient, but hand washing offers a gentler alternative. Sometimes, hand washing is the better choice for your Keds. This method is ideal for delicate Keds models. It is also good for shoes with minor dirt. I often choose hand washing for quick touch-ups. This approach gives you more control over the cleaning process.

You might prefer hand washing if your Keds have delicate embellishments. It is also good if they are made of a blend of materials. Hand washing provides a gentler clean. It reduces the risk of damage. It is also useful when you only have a small stain. You do not need to run a full washing machine cycle. This saves water and energy.

To hand wash your Keds, gather your supplies. You will need a basin or sink, cold water, a mild detergent, and a soft brush. An old toothbrush works perfectly. First, remove the laces and insoles. Brush off any loose dirt, just as you would for machine washing. Pre-treat any stubborn stains with a mild cleaner.

Fill your basin with cold water. Add a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent. Submerge your Keds in the soapy water. Let them soak for about 15-30 minutes. This helps loosen dirt and grime. After soaking, gently scrub the canvas with your soft brush. Pay extra attention to dirty areas and seams. Scrub the rubber soles with the brush. You can use a bit of baking soda for extra cleaning power on the rubber.

Once clean, rinse your Keds thoroughly under cold running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Squeeze out excess water gently. Do not twist or wring the shoes forcefully. This can damage their shape. Stuff them with paper towels. Then, air dry them completely, following the same instructions as for machine-washed Keds. This careful method will keep your Keds clean and preserve them. This is similar to [washing Converse sneakers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-converse-sneakers-be-machine-washed) by hand.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Washing Keds

### Can I wash Keds with other clothes?

It is generally not recommended to wash Keds with clothes. Shoes can be heavy and abrasive. They can damage delicate clothing during the wash cycle. They can also transfer dirt to clothes. Wash Keds separately or with old towels. This protects both your Keds and your garments.

### Can I use bleach on white Keds?

Avoid using bleach on white Keds. Bleach can cause the canvas to yellow over time. It can also weaken the fabric fibers. For brightening white Keds, use a baking soda paste. You can also use oxygen-based stain removers. These are safer and more effective alternatives for keeping them white.

### How often should I wash my Keds?

The frequency depends on wear. For Keds worn daily, washing every 1-2 months is reasonable. For occasional use, every 3-6 months may be sufficient. Avoid over-washing. Excessive washing can cause wear and tear on the fabric. Judge based on their visible dirt and smell.

### What kind of detergent is best for washing Keds?

Use a mild laundry detergent. Liquid detergents are often better than powders. They dissolve more easily. Avoid harsh chemicals or fabric softeners. These can leave residue. A small amount of gentle detergent is enough for a pair of Keds. This helps preserve the material.

### Can I wash Keds that have leather accents?

No, you should not machine wash Keds with leather accents. Leather can crack, stiffen, or shrink when submerged in water. For these types of Keds, spot cleaning is the best method. Use a damp cloth and a mild leather cleaner. Gently clean the canvas parts by hand.

### My Keds still smell after washing. What can I do?

If your Keds still smell, ensure they dried completely. Dampness causes odors. Try sprinkling baking soda inside the shoes. Let it sit overnight. Then shake it out. You can also use shoe deodorizers or cedar shoe inserts. Adding white vinegar to the wash cycle can also help neutralize odors.
