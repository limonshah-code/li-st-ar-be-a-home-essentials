## How To Clean Norwex Cloths

Have you ever wondered how to keep your Norwex cloths working their best? These special microfiber cloths are popular for cleaning many surfaces with just water. But to maintain their powerful cleaning ability, you need to clean Norwex cloths correctly. Regular laundry methods can damage their unique fibers.

Learning how to properly wash and care for your Norwex cloths extends their life and keeps your home spotless. We will explore simple washing steps, explain deep cleaning methods, and share tips for common issues. You will gain knowledge to keep your cloths effective for years. Let's make sure your Norwex cloths continue to shine.

### Takeaway

To ensure your Norwex cloths perform optimally and last longer:
*   Wash Norwex cloths separately from lint-producing items.
*   Use a Norwex Ultra Power Plus Laundry Detergent or a free & clear detergent.
*   Avoid bleach, fabric softener, and dryer sheets.
*   Tumble dry on low heat or air dry completely.
*   Deep clean or "strip" cloths regularly to remove buildup.

Keeping Norwex cloths clean ensures they capture dirt and grime effectively, offering a chemical-free clean for your home. Proper washing and care preserve their unique microfiber structure.

### Understanding Norwex Microfiber: Why Special Care Matters

Norwex cloths are not just any microfiber cloths; they feature a dense weave of microfibers. These tiny fibers create a large surface area, picking up dirt and bacteria efficiently. Each Norwex cloth contains BacLock, an antimicrobial agent, often silver, that purifies the cloth. This agent cleanses the cloth during use and inhibits bacterial growth within the cloth itself.

Because of this unique construction, regular washing methods can harm the fibers. Traditional detergents often contain fillers, optical brighteners, and fragrances that can clog the microscopic spaces in the fibers. Fabric softener is especially damaging. It coats the fibers, making them less effective at picking up grime. Bleach can break down the fibers and reduce the lifespan of your cloths. Understanding these facts helps you care for your Norwex cloths the right way.

Using the right cleaning products and methods protects your investment. When you wash these cloths incorrectly, you lose their key benefits. The ability to clean with just water comes from these tiny fibers. If they are coated or damaged, the cloth cannot absorb or hold dirt effectively. We want to keep those fibers open and ready to work.

Proper care also maintains the BacLock feature. This silver-based agent helps keep the cloth fresh between uses. Washing with harsh chemicals can reduce its effectiveness. My personal experience shows that a well-cared-for Norwex cloth feels different and cleans better. They truly work best when you treat them well.

### Everyday Washing: The Right Way to Clean Norwex Cloths

Cleaning your Norwex cloths after daily use is a simple but important step. You should wash them frequently to remove the dirt and grime they collect. This regular cleaning keeps them ready for your next task. I recommend washing them after every few uses, especially if they cleaned very dirty surfaces.

First, separate your Norwex cloths from other laundry items. Lint from cotton towels or clothes can cling to the microfiber. This lint can reduce the cleaning power of your Norwex cloths. Always wash them in a separate load or with other Norwex items. This prevents lint transfer and keeps the fibers clear.

For washing, use a good quality, residue-free laundry detergent. Norwex offers its own Ultra Power Plus Laundry Detergent, which is excellent for this purpose. If you do not have Norwex detergent, choose a "free and clear" liquid detergent. These detergents lack dyes, perfumes, and fillers that can harm the microfiber. Avoid any detergent with fabric softener built-in.

Use hot water for the wash cycle. Hot water helps release the trapped dirt and oils from the microfiber. Set your washing machine to a normal or heavy-duty cycle. Do not overload your washing machine. Overloading prevents the cloths from rinsing properly. A properly rinsed cloth performs better. For general washing, avoid using excessive detergent. Too much detergent can leave a residue on the cloths. This residue can make the cloths feel less absorbent. I always feel a difference when they are washed just right.

### Deep Cleaning Your Norwex Cloths: Restoring Performance

Sometimes, your Norwex cloths might feel less absorbent or start to smell, even after regular washing. This often happens because of a buildup of detergent residue, hard water minerals, or trapped oils. When this occurs, your cloths need a deep clean, often called "stripping." Stripping helps restore their original performance. This process removes deep-set grime that a regular wash cannot handle.

To strip your Norwex cloths, you will need a large pot, a washing machine, and hot water. Start by boiling a pot of water. Once boiling, turn off the heat and carefully place your dirty Norwex cloths into the hot water. Make sure the cloths are fully submerged. You can add a small amount of Norwex Ultra Power Plus Laundry Detergent or a few drops of dish soap to the water at this point, but it's optional and some prefer just hot water. Let the cloths soak in the hot water for several hours, or even overnight. As the water cools, you will often see it become discolored, showing the dirt and residue being released. This visual evidence confirms the stripping process is working.

After soaking, carefully remove the cloths from the pot. Be careful as they might still be hot. Wring out the excess water. Then, transfer the cloths to your washing machine. Wash them on a hot water cycle with a small amount of Norwex detergent. Do not add any other laundry or any additives. A second rinse cycle is often beneficial to ensure all loosened residue washes away. This deep cleaning method brings life back to tired cloths. It can also help if you are wondering [how to clean mold with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar) on other surfaces, as the principle of using a strong solution for deep grime is similar. For issues with your own washing machine, you might find tips on [how to clean washer with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washer-with-vinegar) helpful.

You might need to deep clean your cloths every few weeks or months, depending on how often you use them and what you clean. Signs that they need stripping include reduced absorbency, a strange smell, or a dull appearance. My cloths always feel much better after a good strip. This step is key for long-term Norwex cloth care.

### Drying Norwex Cloths: Essential Steps for Longevity

Drying your Norwex cloths correctly is as important as washing them. Incorrect drying methods can damage the microfiber or reduce its effectiveness. High heat and dryer sheets are the main things to avoid. Proper drying helps your cloths last longer and perform their best.

My preferred method is air drying. Hang your Norwex cloths to air dry in a well-ventilated area. You can hang them on a drying rack, a clothesline, or even over a shower rod. Air drying is gentle on the fibers. It prevents shrinkage and maintains the cloth's structure. This method also saves energy. Air drying ensures the BacLock agent in the cloth has time to work its magic.

If you choose to use a dryer, set it to the lowest heat setting. High heat can melt or damage the delicate microfiber strands. Use the "tumble dry low" or "air fluff" setting if available. Remove the cloths as soon as they are dry. Over-drying can also harm the fibers. You might even notice them feeling stiff if they are over-dried on high heat.

Never use dryer sheets when drying Norwex cloths. Dryer sheets contain waxes and chemicals that coat fabric. This coating will clog the microfiber pores, making your cloths less absorbent and effective. The same principle applies to fabric softener in the wash cycle. The goal is to keep the microfiber channels open and clear. Avoiding dryer sheets is a simple way to protect your cloth's cleaning power. My cloths feel much softer and work better when I skip the dryer sheets.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Norwex Cloths

Many people make small errors when cleaning their Norwex cloths. These mistakes can quickly reduce the cloth's lifespan and effectiveness. Knowing what to avoid helps you preserve your investment. I always try to share these common pitfalls.

**1. Using Fabric Softener:** This is perhaps the biggest mistake. Fabric softener leaves a waxy coating on the microfiber. This coating fills the tiny spaces in the fibers. As a result, the cloth cannot absorb water or trap dirt properly. It feels less effective and leaves streaks. Always skip fabric softener, no matter what.

**2. Using Bleach:** Bleach is a harsh chemical. It can break down the delicate fibers of your Norwex cloths. This weakens the cloth and shortens its life. Bleach also degrades the BacLock silver agent. Instead of bleach, use the deep cleaning method discussed earlier for sanitizing.

**3. Washing with Linty Items:** Washing Norwex cloths with cotton towels or fuzzy clothing causes lint to transfer. This lint gets trapped in the microfiber. When your cloth is full of lint, it cannot pick up dirt from surfaces. Always wash Norwex cloths in a separate load or with other Norwex products.

**4. Using Excessive Detergent:** While you need some detergent, using too much can leave a residue. This residue can build up over time. It can make cloths feel stiff or less absorbent. Use only a small amount of Norwex Ultra Power Plus or a free & clear detergent. Follow the detergent's instructions for load size.

**5. Drying on High Heat:** High heat can melt or damage the microfiber. This changes the cloth's structure and reduces its ability to clean. Always tumble dry on low or air dry. My cloths last much longer when I follow this rule. Avoiding these mistakes ensures your Norwex cloths stay effective and ready for action.

### Troubleshooting Norwex Cloth Issues: Smells and Stiffness

Even with proper care, Norwex cloths can sometimes develop issues. They might start to smell, or they might feel stiff after washing. These problems are usually fixable and point to a need for deeper cleaning or a slight adjustment in your routine. I have dealt with these issues many times.

If your Norwex cloths smell bad, it often means there's a buildup of bacteria, dirt, or detergent residue. The BacLock agent helps, but it doesn't eliminate all issues, especially with heavy use. First, try a deep clean or "stripping" as described earlier. This process effectively removes trapped odor-causing particles. Soaking them in hot water for several hours usually does the trick. You can also try adding a quarter cup of white distilled vinegar to the wash cycle. Vinegar is a natural deodorizer and helps break down mineral deposits. It's also great if you're wondering [how to clean bathroom with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bathroom-with-vinegar) or [how to clean glass with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-glass-with-vinegar), so you might already have it on hand.

If your cloths feel stiff after drying, it's usually due to hard water minerals or detergent residue. Hard water leaves mineral deposits that can make fabrics feel crunchy. Excessive detergent can also leave a film. To address this, make sure you are using a residue-free detergent. Try adding a half cup of white distilled vinegar to the rinse cycle of your wash. The vinegar helps soften the water and removes mineral buildup. This also works well if you have hard water stains in your bathroom and are looking into [how to clean shower with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shower-with-vinegar). Another option is to do a second rinse cycle for your cloths. This ensures all detergent is thoroughly washed away. Over-drying on high heat can also make cloths feel stiff, so check your dryer settings. With these tips, you can bring your Norwex cloths back to their soft, absorbent state.

### Storing Your Norwex Cloths: Keeping Them Ready

Proper storage of your Norwex cloths is simple but important. It helps keep them clean, fresh, and ready for their next cleaning task. Storing them correctly also prevents any potential smells or mildew from developing. I always try to store my cloths in a smart way.

First, always ensure your Norwex cloths are completely dry before storing them. Storing damp cloths, even if they contain BacLock, can lead to mildew and unpleasant odors. Hang them to air dry fully or ensure they are thoroughly machine-dried on low heat. Once dry, they are ready for storage.

You can fold your dry Norwex cloths neatly and store them in a clean drawer or a basket. Keeping them in a dedicated spot helps you find them easily. Avoid storing them in airtight containers or plastic bags for extended periods. While they might seem to keep things neat, these containers can trap any residual moisture and prevent proper air circulation. Air circulation is key for the BacLock agent to work effectively and keep the cloth fresh.

Consider categorizing your cloths if you have many types. For example, keep kitchen cloths separate from bathroom cloths. This practice prevents cross-contamination. You might store kitchen cloths in a kitchen drawer and bathroom cloths in a bathroom cabinet. This system keeps things hygienic and organized. My storage method is to roll them and place them in an open basket under the sink. This makes them easy to grab when needed. Simple storage practices help maintain the hygiene and effectiveness of your Norwex cloths.

### Extending the Life of Your Norwex Investment

Norwex cloths are an investment in your cleaning routine. They are designed for durability and long-term use. By following simple care guidelines, you can significantly extend their life. This saves you money and reduces waste. I want to make sure my cloths last as long as possible.

One key aspect is proper usage. Use the right cloth for the right task. For example, use the EnviroCloth for general cleaning and the Window Cloth for streak-free finishes. This prevents unnecessary wear on specific cloths. Avoid using Norwex cloths on extremely harsh or abrasive surfaces that could damage the microfiber. This includes rough concrete or very sharp edges.

Regular and correct washing is the most important factor for longevity. Adhering to the "no bleach, no fabric softener, no dryer sheets" rule is non-negotiable. These substances break down the fibers and reduce their effectiveness. Frequent washing, rather than infrequent heavy washing, is also better. It prevents deep dirt buildup that is harder to remove. I find that regular washing keeps my cloths softer and more effective.

Periodically inspecting your cloths can also help. Check for tears or excessive wear. While Norwex cloths are tough, they are not indestructible. If a cloth becomes severely damaged, it might be time to replace it. However, with proper care, your cloths should last for many years. My first Norwex cloths are still in great shape after extensive use. Treating your Norwex cloths with care ensures they remain a valuable part of your cleaning arsenal for a long time.
