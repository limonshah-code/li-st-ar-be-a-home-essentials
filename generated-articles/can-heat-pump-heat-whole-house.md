### Understanding How a Heat Pump Heats Your House

Heat pumps operate differently from traditional furnaces. Furnaces burn fuel to create heat. Heat pumps move heat from one place to another. In heating mode, a heat pump extracts heat from outside air or ground. It then transfers this heat inside your home. This process is very efficient.

Even cold air contains some heat energy. A heat pump captures this heat using a refrigerant. The refrigerant absorbs heat outdoors, then compresses to raise its temperature. This hot refrigerant then releases its heat into your home's air. The system distributes this warm air through your ductwork. This method uses less energy than generating heat directly.

#### Air Source vs. Geothermal Heat Pumps

There are two main types of heat pumps. Air source heat pumps pull heat from the outside air. They are common and cost-effective for most homes. Geothermal heat pumps use the stable temperature of the earth. They circulate fluid through underground pipes. This type is more expensive to install but offers higher efficiency.

Both types can effectively heat an entire house. Air source models are popular for their versatility. Geothermal systems provide consistent performance regardless of outdoor air temperature extremes. The choice depends on your climate, budget, and property characteristics. Each system has unique benefits for whole-house heating.

#### The Refrigerant Cycle Explained

The refrigerant cycle is central to a heat pump's function. In heating mode, the outdoor coil acts as an evaporator. It absorbs heat from the surrounding air. The refrigerant inside turns into a warm gas. This gas travels to the compressor. The compressor increases the gas pressure and temperature.

The hot, high-pressure gas then moves to the indoor coil. This coil acts as a condenser. Here, the gas releases its heat into your home's air. As it releases heat, the gas cools and turns back into a liquid. This liquid then flows through an expansion valve. The valve reduces its pressure and temperature. The cool liquid refrigerant returns to the outdoor coil, ready to absorb more heat. This continuous cycle effectively warms your home. Understanding this cycle helps appreciate the system's efficiency compared to other heating methods, such as those discussed in our article, [Is Heat Pump More Efficient Than Electric Heat?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-heat-pump-more-efficient-than-electric-heat).
