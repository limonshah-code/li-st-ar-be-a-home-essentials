## Understanding the Leesa Sleep Trial: Key Details

Leesa offers a generous sleep trial for their mattresses. This trial period lasts for 100 nights. It starts on the day your mattress is delivered. This gives you ample time to decide if the mattress suits your needs. We always recommend sleeping on the mattress for at least 30 nights. This allows your body to adjust to the new feel. It also gives the mattress time to fully expand and settle.

The 100-night trial is a core part of Leesa's customer commitment. It means you can try the mattress in your home environment. You do not need to feel rushed into a decision. Leesa believes their mattresses offer superior comfort. They understand comfort is personal. This trial reduces the risk for you. You get to test it without commitment.

During this period, you can assess the mattress's firmness. You can also check its support and temperature regulation. Pay attention to how you sleep each night. Consider any changes in your comfort or back pain. If you determine the Leesa mattress is not the right fit, you can proceed with a return. This trial period is crucial for a successful return. It sets the timeframe for all return requests.

## Eligibility for Your Leesa Mattress Return

Before you initiate a return, you must check your mattress's eligibility. Leesa has specific criteria for returns. First, your return request must fall within the 100-night sleep trial. This period starts on your delivery date. Requests made after this window are not accepted. Ensure you keep track of your purchase date.

Second, the mattress must be in good condition. This means no rips, tears, or permanent stains. A mattress protector is always recommended to keep your mattress clean. It guards against spills and accidents. While a Leesa mattress does not need to be in its original packaging for return, it needs to be free of damage. You should not have any dirt or pet hair on it.

Third, Leesa's policy allows one return per household per product type. This means if you return one Leesa mattress, you cannot return another Leesa mattress later. You can return other Leesa products like pillows or bases. But the mattress type limit remains. Always review the full terms on Leesa's website. This ensures you meet all requirements. A clean, well-maintained mattress within the trial period is key to a successful return.

## Initiating the Leesa Mattress Return Process: Step-by-Step

Starting your Leesa mattress return is a straightforward process. You need to contact Leesa's customer support team. This is the first and most important step. Do not try to ship the mattress back yourself. Leesa handles all logistics for returns.

First, locate your original order number. This number helps Leesa quickly find your purchase details. You can find it in your order confirmation email. Next, visit the Leesa website or call their customer service line. Explain that you wish to return your mattress. State your reason for the return. This feedback helps Leesa improve their products.

The customer service representative will guide you. They will ask a few questions to confirm your eligibility. They will then explain the next steps. Leesa typically arranges for a local charity or recycling partner to pick up the mattress. You will not need to put the mattress back in its original box. Most mattresses cannot be re-boxed anyway once expanded. Leesa aims to ensure the mattress goes to a good cause or is disposed of responsibly. They will provide details about the pickup schedule. Wait for their instructions before doing anything with the mattress. This ensures your refund is processed correctly.

## What Happens After Your Leesa Return Request?

Once you submit your Leesa mattress return request, the process moves forward. Leesa's team will verify your information. They will confirm your eligibility based on the trial period and mattress condition. This usually takes a few business days. You will receive an email or phone call with an update.

Leesa works with various organizations for mattress pickups. These often include local charities, donation centers, or recycling facilities. They do not ask you to ship the mattress back to them directly. This makes the return process much easier for you. Leesa will schedule a pickup time that works for you. The pickup service is free of charge. You do not pay any return shipping fees.

After the mattress is successfully picked up, Leesa processes your refund. The refund typically goes back to your original payment method. This usually takes 5-10 business days after pickup. The exact timing can depend on your bank. Leesa aims to make this part of the process as smooth as possible. You will receive a confirmation email when your refund has been issued. This confirms the return is complete.

## Preparing Your Leesa Mattress for Pickup

Preparing your Leesa mattress for pickup is a simple task. You do not need to re-box the mattress. Leesa specifically states that they do not require original packaging for returns. Most mattresses, once expanded, cannot fit back into their original boxes anyway. However, you should ensure the mattress is accessible.

Clear a path from your bedroom to your front door. Remove any bedding, sheets, or mattress protectors. The pickup crew will take the mattress as is. Make sure the mattress is clean and free from any new damage or stains that occurred during your trial. If your mattress developed a stain, knowing [how to spot clean a mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-spot-clean-a-mattress) might be helpful before pickup.

The pickup team will handle the heavy lifting. You do not need to move the mattress outside yourself. Just ensure it is ready for them when they arrive.

## Leesa Mattress Return FAQs and Important Considerations

### Can I return my Leesa mattress if it has a small stain?
Leesa's return policy generally requires the mattress to be in good, donatable condition. A small, easily cleanable spot might be acceptable. However, large or permanent stains can make it ineligible. Always contact Leesa customer service to discuss your specific situation. They can advise you on whether it will pass inspection.

### Do I get a full refund for my Leesa mattress return?
Yes, Leesa provides a full refund for eligible mattress returns. This includes the full purchase price you paid. You will not pay any return shipping fees or restocking fees. The refund is processed to your original payment method after the mattress pickup.

### What if I bought my Leesa mattress from a retailer, not directly from Leesa?
If you purchased your Leesa mattress from a third-party retailer, like Amazon or West Elm, their return policy applies. Leesa's 100-night trial and return process are for direct purchases only. Contact the specific retailer where you bought the mattress. They will have their own return procedures.

### How long does it take to get my refund after returning a Leesa mattress?
Once Leesa arranges the pickup of your mattress, they process your refund. This usually takes between 5 to 10 business days. The exact timing depends on your bank's processing times. You will receive a confirmation email when your refund is issued.

### Can I exchange my Leesa mattress for a different Leesa model?
Leesa's policy focuses on returns and full refunds. They do not typically offer direct exchanges for a different model. If you want a different Leesa mattress, you would return your current one for a refund. Then, you would place a new order for the desired model. This acts as a two-step exchange process.

### What if I am outside the 100-night trial period?
If you are outside the 100-night sleep trial, you cannot return the mattress to Leesa for a refund. The trial period is strict. If you are past this window, consider donating the mattress yourself, selling it, or looking into local recycling options for unwanted mattresses.

## Leesa Returns: Beyond the Initial Trial Period

Once the 100-night sleep trial period ends, Leesa's direct return policy no longer applies. This means you cannot get a refund from Leesa for your mattress. However, your options for an unwanted Leesa mattress do not vanish completely. You have a few alternatives to consider.

Many people choose to donate their mattress. Local charities or shelters often accept mattresses in good condition. This can provide comfort to someone in need. It also prevents the mattress from ending up in a landfill. Always check with the charity beforehand. They might have specific requirements for mattress donations. They often require the mattress to be clean and free of significant damage or stains. For instance, if you regularly use a [mattress protector](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-on-a-mattress-protector), it helps keep the mattress in a donatable state.

Selling your mattress is another option. Online marketplaces or local classifieds can be good places to list it. Be honest about the mattress's age and condition. Price it fairly for a used item. Some people look for affordable, gently used mattresses.

Finally, consider recycling your mattress. Many cities or counties have mattress recycling programs. These programs break down mattresses into their components. Materials like steel, foam, and fabric can be reused. This is an environmentally friendly way to dispose of an old mattress. There might be a small fee for this service. Check your local waste management website for details. If you're unsure about protecting it during a self-move to a donation center, knowing [how to protect mattress when moving](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-protect-mattress-when-moving) can be helpful. While Leesa facilitates returns for trial mattresses, these alternatives become important for mattresses outside the trial window.
