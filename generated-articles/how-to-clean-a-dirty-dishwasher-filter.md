## How To Clean A Dirty Dishwasher Filter

Having clean dishes is a simple joy. If your dishwasher leaves spots or food bits, a **dirty dishwasher filter** is likely the cause. I know how frustrating it feels to unload dishes that are still grimy. Cleaning this filter is a simple step to bring back sparkle and keep your appliance running well. This article will guide you through the process, from finding the filter to cleaning it thoroughly. We will ensure your dishwasher works at its best, giving you clean dishes every time.

### Takeaway:

*   Regularly clean your dishwasher filter to prevent dirty dishes and improve performance.
*   Remove the filter by twisting or unclipping it from the dishwasher base.
*   Rinse the filter under running water, scrubbing with a brush and dish soap for tough grime.
*   Reinstall the filter correctly to ensure proper operation.

To clean a dirty dishwasher filter, simply remove it from the appliance's base. Rinse the filter thoroughly under warm running water. Use a soft brush and dish soap to scrub away food particles and grease. This process helps your dishwasher wash dishes better and prevents bad smells.

### Understanding Your Dishwasher Filter: Why Cleaning Matters

Your dishwasher works hard to clean dishes every day. Its filter plays a big role in this process. This small part catches food scraps and debris that wash off your plates. Without a clean filter, these particles can redeposit onto your dishes. This results in spots and grime even after a full wash cycle.

A dirty filter also affects the dishwasher's efficiency. The pump has to work harder to move water through a clogged filter. This can reduce water pressure and lead to poor cleaning performance. Over time, a heavily clogged filter might even cause damage to other parts of your appliance. Keeping it clean is a proactive step for its lifespan.

Neglecting your dishwasher filter can also cause unpleasant smells. Food trapped in the filter will rot and create foul odors. These smells can transfer to your clean dishes, which nobody wants. Regular filter cleaning prevents these issues. It ensures your dishwasher cleans well and smells fresh. Just like cleaning other household filters, such as an [under-sink water filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-under-sink-water-filter), maintaining your dishwasher's filter is key to appliance health and home hygiene.

A clean filter means sparkling dishes. It also means a longer-lasting, better-smelling appliance. I always check my filter once a month to avoid these common problems. This simple habit saves me time and effort in the long run.

### Recognizing a Dirty Dishwasher Filter: Signs and Symptoms

How can you tell if your dishwasher filter needs attention? There are clear signs that point to a dirty filter. The most obvious sign is visible food particles on your "clean" dishes. You might see small bits of food or a hazy film left behind. This indicates the filter cannot trap debris effectively anymore.

Another common symptom is a bad smell coming from your dishwasher. Old food stuck in the filter starts to decay. This creates a foul odor that can fill your kitchen. The smell might get worse when you open the dishwasher door after a cycle. If your kitchen smells strange, check the filter first.

Reduced cleaning performance is also a major indicator. Your dishes might not feel as clean as they used to. Glasses could have streaks, and plates might have water spots. This happens because dirty water recirculates instead of being properly filtered. The spray arms might not get enough pressure either.

You might also notice water not draining properly. A severely clogged filter can block water flow. This can leave standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher. If you see any of these signs, it is time to inspect and **clean a dirty dishwasher filter**. Catching these issues early helps prevent bigger problems. I always keep an eye out for these signals.

### How to Remove Your Dishwasher Filter Safely

Removing the dishwasher filter is usually a simple process. Most filters are at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You will need to pull out the bottom dish rack first to access it. This gives you clear space to work.

There are two main types of dishwasher filters: self-cleaning and manual. Self-cleaning filters grind up food bits, but still need occasional checks. Manual filters, which are more common, require regular cleaning by hand. Yours will likely be a manual filter if you are reading this guide.

Look for a cylindrical or flat screen component. It will typically be located under the spray arm in the center of the tub floor. Some filters have a handle for easy gripping. Others might require a simple twist to unlock. Read your dishwasher's manual if you are unsure about its specific design.

To remove a cylindrical filter, twist it counter-clockwise. It should then lift straight up. For flat screen filters, you might need to lift a small latch or pull it straight out. Some models have two parts: a coarse filter and a fine micro-filter. Remove both if your model has them.

Always be gentle when removing the filter. Forcing it can cause damage. Once removed, you are ready for the cleaning step. I find that taking a picture of the filter before removal helps me remember how it goes back in. This step is key before you can **clean a dirty dishwasher filter**.

### Cleaning Your Dishwasher Filter: Simple Steps for Best Results

Now that you have removed the filter, it is time to clean it. This part is straightforward and effective. First, take the filter to your sink. Rinse it thoroughly under warm running water. You will see many of the loose food particles wash away easily.

Next, use a soft brush to scrub the filter. A toothbrush works perfectly for this job. Apply a small amount of dish soap to the brush. Gently scrub all surfaces of the filter. Pay close attention to any mesh or screen areas where food might be stuck. You will be amazed at the gunk that comes off.

If you find stubborn, greasy buildup, let the filter soak. Fill a small bowl with warm water and a little dish soap. Place the filter in the bowl and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen tough grime. After soaking, scrub it again. You should see all the debris come off easily.

Make sure to clean both parts if your dishwasher has a two-part filter system. The coarser filter catches larger bits, and the micro-filter catches smaller ones. Both need to be free of obstructions for proper function. Rinse the filter completely to remove all soap residue.

Hold the filter up to the light to check your work. You should be able to see through the mesh clearly. No food particles or greasy film should remain. This thorough cleaning ensures your efforts pay off. I always feel satisfied seeing a sparkling clean filter. You have successfully cleaned your **dirty dishwasher filter**.

### Reinstalling Your Clean Dishwasher Filter and Preventative Care

Once your dishwasher filter is sparkling clean, it is time to put it back. This step is just as important as removing it. Make sure the filter is completely dry or just damp. Place the filter back into its housing at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.

If your filter twists into place, turn it clockwise until it locks securely. You should feel a slight click or resistance, indicating it is properly seated. For flat filters, slide them back into their grooves until they click or sit flush. Ensure all parts of a two-part filter system are correctly aligned and secured.

A poorly installed filter can cause problems. It might vibrate during cycles or allow food particles to bypass it. This defeats the purpose of cleaning it. Double-check that it feels snug and does not wobble. Push the bottom dish rack back into place once the filter is secure.

Preventative care is key to keeping your filter clean longer. Scrape larger food scraps off plates before loading them. This reduces the amount of debris the filter needs to catch. A quick rinse of heavily soiled items also helps. These small habits reduce the strain on your filter.

I recommend checking your dishwasher filter monthly. If you use your dishwasher daily or wash very dirty dishes, check it more often. A quick rinse might be all it needs most times. This regular maintenance ensures your appliance runs well. It keeps your dishes consistently clean and prevents the need to **clean a dirty dishwasher filter** as often.

### Common Dishwasher Filter Problems and Quick Solutions

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter some dishwasher filter problems. One common issue is a persistent bad smell, even after cleaning. This might mean the smell has seeped into other parts of the dishwasher. Running a hot cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or white vinegar can help. Place a bowl of white vinegar on the top rack and run an empty hot cycle.

Sometimes, dishes still come out dirty after cleaning the filter. This could indicate other problems with your dishwasher. Check the spray arms for clogged holes. Food particles can get stuck there too. Use a toothpick to clear any blockages. Also, ensure you are using enough detergent and that your water temperature is hot enough.

A loose filter can also cause issues. If the filter is not properly locked into place, it can vibrate or shift. This can allow debris to bypass it or even cause rattling noises. Always ensure the filter is twisted or clicked securely into its housing after cleaning. If it still feels loose, check your appliance manual for specific installation tips.

If your filter is damaged, it might need replacement. Cracks or tears in the mesh will allow food through. You can usually order a replacement filter from your dishwasher's manufacturer. This is a simple fix for an ongoing problem.

Addressing these common problems ensures your filter and dishwasher work as expected. Regular checks and immediate solutions help maintain a clean and efficient appliance. I find that quick action prevents small issues from becoming big headaches.

### FAQ Section

**How often should I clean my dishwasher filter?**
You should clean your dishwasher filter at least once a month. If you run your dishwasher daily, or often wash dishes with a lot of food residue, check and clean it every two weeks. Regular checks prevent food buildup and keep your appliance performing its best. This simple task maintains good cleaning results.

**Can I put my dishwasher filter in the dishwasher to clean it?**
No, you should not put your dishwasher filter in the dishwasher for cleaning. The dishwasher’s strong jets and high heat can damage the delicate mesh of the filter. It also will not effectively remove all the trapped food particles and grease. Always clean the filter by hand with warm water and soap.

**What happens if I never clean my dishwasher filter?**
If you never clean your dishwasher filter, it will become clogged with food and grease. This causes dishes to come out dirty with food particles or a film. Your dishwasher may also develop unpleasant odors. Over time, it can reduce cleaning efficiency and may even cause damage to the pump.

**Do all dishwashers have a filter that needs cleaning?**
Most modern dishwashers have a removable filter that requires manual cleaning. Older models or some commercial units might have "self-cleaning" filters with food grinders. Even these self-cleaning types benefit from occasional inspection and rinsing. It is always best to check your appliance manual to be sure.

**What cleaning solution is best for a dirty dishwasher filter?**
Warm water and regular dish soap are the best cleaning solution for a dirty dishwasher filter. For tough grease or stubborn food, a gentle scrubbing brush like an old toothbrush works well. You can also let it soak in warm soapy water for a few minutes before scrubbing. Avoid harsh chemicals.

**Why does my dishwasher smell even after cleaning the filter?**
If your dishwasher still smells after cleaning the filter, other parts may need attention. Food particles can hide in the spray arms, door gasket, or drain hose. Run a cleaning cycle with white vinegar or a specialized dishwasher cleaner. Regularly wipe down the door seal to prevent mildew buildup.
