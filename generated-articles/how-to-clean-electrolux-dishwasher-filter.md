## How To Clean Electrolux Dishwasher Filter

Do your dishes come out of the dishwasher still feeling gritty or looking spotty? This common issue often points to a clogged dishwasher filter. Many people overlook this small but vital component. Learning **how to clean an Electrolux dishwasher filter** keeps your appliance working its best.

A clean filter ensures proper water circulation and drainage. It prevents food particles from redepositing onto your plates and glasses. This guide provides clear, simple steps to clean your Electrolux dishwasher filter. We will cover finding the filter, removing it, cleaning it thoroughly, and putting it back. You will soon enjoy sparkling clean dishes every time. Let's get started on improving your dishwasher's performance.

### Takeaway

Keeping your Electrolux dishwasher filter clean is simple and improves performance.
*   Locate and carefully remove the filter assembly.
*   Rinse all parts under running water.
*   Use a soft brush and mild soap for stubborn grime.
*   Reinstall the dry filter components securely.
*   Clean the filter regularly, typically monthly, to prevent issues.

To clean an Electrolux dishwasher filter, first, turn off the appliance. Then, twist and lift the filter assembly from the bottom of the tub. Rinse the filter parts under warm water, scrubbing away food debris with a soft brush and mild dish soap. Finally, reinsert the clean, dry filter firmly into its place.

## Understanding Your Electrolux Dishwasher Filter System

Your Electrolux dishwasher uses a filter to trap food particles and debris. This filter stops these particles from recirculating onto your dishes during a wash cycle. A clean filter ensures good water flow and prevents clogs in the drain pump. It directly impacts how clean your dishes become. If your dishes are not clean, the filter might be the problem.

Electrolux dishwashers typically feature a multi-part filter system. This system usually includes a coarse filter and a fine mesh filter. The coarse filter catches larger food scraps. The fine mesh filter traps smaller particles. Both parts work together to keep the wash water clean. This design helps maintain hygiene inside the dishwasher.

Knowing where your dishwasher filter is helps with cleaning. Most Electrolux models have the filter located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You will find it beneath the lower spray arm. It usually consists of a cylindrical filter and a flat filter beneath it. Regularly checking this area is good practice. Understanding its location is the first step to proper maintenance.

A clogged filter can cause several problems. You might notice food residue on your dishes. The dishwasher could smell bad. The wash cycle might not clean as well as it used to. These are clear signs your filter needs attention. Cleaning the filter helps avoid these issues.

Keeping this system clean is important. It prevents buildup and maintains efficiency. A well-maintained filter also extends the life of your appliance. I always check my filter regularly for any signs of debris. This simple act saves future trouble. A dirty filter also makes your dishwasher work harder. This wastes energy and wears out parts faster. Keep it clean for best results.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you start cleaning your Electrolux dishwasher filter, you need to gather a few items. Having everything ready makes the process easy and quick. You probably have most of these supplies around your house already. We aim for a simple and effective cleaning approach. This preparation step ensures a smooth cleaning experience for you.

You will need some basic cleaning tools. First, get a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands. Dishwasher filters can hold old food particles and grease. Gloves keep your hands clean and hygienic. Next, grab a soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush. This tool is perfect for scrubbing away stubborn bits of food. I find that an old toothbrush gets into small grooves very well.

You also need a mild dish soap. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. These can damage the filter material. A gentle dish soap mixed with warm water works perfectly for dissolving grease and grime. You might also want a clean towel or paper towels. These help dry the filter parts before you reinstall them. Finally, a small bucket or bowl for soaking the filter can be useful.

Safety is important when cleaning appliances. Always ensure your dishwasher is turned off and unplugged before you start. This prevents accidental starts or electrical shocks. Using mild soap and warm water is also safer for you and your appliance. Never use bleach or strong acids. These can corrode plastic parts and internal components.

I recommend using plain white vinegar sometimes. It is a natural disinfectant and helps break down mineral deposits. You can add a splash to your soaking water. This gives the filter an extra refresh. Gathering these simple items will make cleaning your Electrolux dishwasher filter a straightforward task. It will also ensure the job is done effectively and safely.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Remove the Electrolux Dishwasher Filter

Removing the filter from your Electrolux dishwasher is a simple process. You must do this carefully to avoid damage. The first step is always safety. Make sure your dishwasher is off. Unplug it from the power outlet if possible. This prevents any accidental starts while your hands are inside the tub.

Now, fully open the dishwasher door. You will see the lower spray arm and the bottom of the tub. The filter system is located right in the middle of this area. It often looks like a cylindrical part with a handle or an arrow for direction. Some models might have a flat filter cover over the top. You may also consult [where is the filter on dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-filter-on-dishwasher) for general location tips.

To remove the cylindrical filter, simply twist it counter-clockwise. You will hear a click or feel it loosen. Once it loosens, you can lift it straight up and out. This part usually includes the fine mesh filter. Be gentle as you lift it. It might be full of trapped food particles. This first piece is the main filter basket.

After removing the cylindrical part, you might see a flat, coarse filter underneath. This coarse filter often lays flat on the bottom of the tub. It may have a small handle or notch for easy removal. Carefully lift this coarse filter out. Sometimes, these two pieces are connected and come out as one assembly. Look at your specific Electrolux model manual if you are unsure.

Some Electrolux models combine the filters into a single unit. In these cases, you simply twist the whole unit and lift it out. Always handle the filter parts with care. They are made of plastic and can break if forced. If you encounter any resistance, check your dishwasher's user manual. It will have specific instructions for your model. For more detailed instructions, you can refer to [how to get dishwasher filter out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-dishwasher-filter-out). Once removed, you are ready to give these parts a thorough cleaning.

## Thoroughly Cleaning Your Electrolux Dishwasher Filter Components

Now that you have removed the filter parts, it is time for a deep clean. This step is important for getting rid of all the trapped gunk. A truly clean filter works much better. I always make sure to be gentle but thorough. This process restores your dishwasher's performance.

First, take the filter components to your sink. Hold each piece under warm, running water. Rinse away as much loose food debris as you can. You will likely see chunks of food, grease, and other residue. This initial rinse removes the biggest culprits. Make sure water flows through the mesh screens.

Next, use your soft-bristled brush or old toothbrush. Gently scrub all surfaces of the filter parts. Pay close attention to the mesh screens and any crevices. These areas often trap small particles that water alone cannot dislodge. Use mild dish soap with the warm water. A small amount of soap on the brush helps break down grease. I often let the parts sit in a bowl of warm, soapy water for a few minutes if the grime is particularly stubborn. This helps loosen dried-on food.

Do not forget to clean the filter housing area inside the dishwasher. Sometimes, food particles accumulate around where the filter sits. Use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe this area clean. You can also use a little mild dish soap here. Rinse the area with a small amount of water afterward. Ensure no soap residue remains. This ensures overall cleanliness.

After scrubbing, rinse all filter components again under clean, running water. Make sure all soap residue is gone. Check each piece carefully to ensure no food particles remain. Hold them up to the light to inspect the mesh. If you see any remaining bits, repeat the scrubbing process. A perfectly clean filter is crucial for the best results. For more specific cleaning tips, you can refer to [how to clean dishwasher filter Electrolux](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-electrolux) and [how to clean filter in dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-in-dishwasher). This thorough cleaning will make a big difference.

## Reinstalling the Clean Electrolux Dishwasher Filter Correctly

After you thoroughly clean and inspect your Electrolux dishwasher filter, it is time to put it back. Proper reinstallation is just as important as cleaning. An incorrectly installed filter can lead to poor wash results or even damage. I always ensure each piece fits snugly. This step ensures your dishwasher operates correctly.

First, ensure all filter components are completely dry. You can air-dry them or use a clean towel. Drying them prevents any immediate mildew growth. It also helps prevent components from slipping during reinstallation. A dry filter is easier to handle and secure.

Start by placing the coarse filter back into its spot at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It should lay flat and fit perfectly into the recessed area. Make sure it is oriented correctly. There might be specific notches or guides for alignment. This flat filter forms the base of the filter system.

Next, take the cylindrical fine mesh filter. Lower it into the center of the coarse filter. Align the tabs or arrows on the cylindrical filter with the corresponding slots or markings in the dishwasher tub. Gently push it down into place. It should sit flush with the coarse filter.

Once in place, twist the cylindrical filter clockwise until it locks securely. You should feel it click into position. This lock ensures the filter stays put during cycles. It prevents any leaks or dislodgements. Test it with a slight pull to confirm it is secure. If it moves, repeat the alignment and twisting process. For more detailed instructions on putting the filter back, check out [how to put dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in) or [how to put back dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-back-dishwasher-filter).

A correctly reinstalled filter keeps food particles out of your pump and spray arms. It also ensures water flows as it should. Always double-check your work. This small effort guarantees your dishes come out sparkling clean. You have successfully completed the cleaning and reinstallation process.

## When to Clean Your Electrolux Dishwasher Filter

Knowing when to clean your Electrolux dishwasher filter is crucial for consistent performance. It is not a one-time task. Regular cleaning prevents problems before they start. I follow a simple schedule to keep my dishwasher in top shape. This helps maintain its efficiency and extends its life.

The general recommendation is to clean your dishwasher filter once a month. This frequency works well for most households. If you use your dishwasher daily, or if you often wash heavily soiled dishes, you might need to clean it more often. Consider cleaning it every two weeks in such cases. This prevents heavy buildup from occurring.

Several factors influence how often you should clean the filter. If you often scrape plates but do not rinse them, more food particles enter the dishwasher. This means the filter will clog faster. Washing a lot of greasy pans also increases filter grime. Households with many people typically use the dishwasher more, requiring more frequent checks.

Your dishwasher itself will give you signs when the filter needs cleaning. If you notice food residue on your "clean" dishes, it is a clear sign. A foul odor coming from the dishwasher is another indicator. If the wash cycle seems longer or less effective, the filter might be blocked. Do not wait for these problems to become severe. Address them promptly. For more information on frequency, see [how often should you clean your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-your-dishwasher-filter) and [how often should you clean the dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-the-dishwasher-filter).

Making filter cleaning a part of your routine is smart. You can set a reminder on your phone or mark it on your calendar. This simple maintenance task avoids bigger problems later. A clean filter ensures optimal water pressure and circulation. This leads to truly clean and sparkling dishes every time.

## Maintaining Overall Electrolux Dishwasher Performance

Cleaning the filter is a significant step, but maintaining your Electrolux dishwasher involves more. A few extra steps keep your appliance running smoothly and efficiently. These practices complement filter cleaning for maximum cleanliness and performance. I find these small habits make a big difference in my kitchen.

First, regularly check and clean the spray arms. Food particles can get stuck in the small holes of the spray arms. This reduces water pressure and affects cleaning quality. Remove the spray arms by unscrewing them or pulling them off gently. Use a toothpick or small brush to clear any blocked holes. Rinse them under water. Then, put them back securely.

Second, use a dishwasher cleaner periodically. Once every one to three months, run an empty cycle with a specialized dishwasher cleaning product. These cleaners help remove grease, limescale, and soap scum from internal components you cannot easily reach. You can also use white vinegar. Place a cup of white vinegar in an empty dishwasher and run a hot cycle. This helps sanitize and remove odors.

Third, ensure you are using the correct amount of detergent. Too much can lead to residue. Too little might not clean effectively. Check your detergent packaging for dosage instructions based on water hardness. Also, keep your rinse aid dispenser full. Rinse aid helps water sheet off dishes. This prevents water spots and aids drying. Learn more about this by checking [how to fill rinse aid in Electrolux dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fill-rinse-aid-in-electrolux-dishwasher).

Finally, load your dishwasher properly. Do not overload it. Ensure items do not block the spray arms from spinning. Place dishes so water can reach all surfaces. Scrape large food scraps from plates before loading. This reduces the amount of debris the filter needs to catch. Following these simple steps alongside regular filter cleaning guarantees peak performance from your Electrolux dishwasher.
