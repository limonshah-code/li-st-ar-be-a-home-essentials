Bringing a new baby home is an exciting time. It also brings many new experiences, like learning to breastfeed. Proper positioning helps make nursing a positive experience for you and your baby. This is where a good nursing pillow, like My Brest Friend, becomes a true essential.

A quality nursing pillow offers vital support, easing strain on your back and neck. It helps position your baby correctly for a deep, comfortable latch. In this guide, we explore how to use My Brest Friend nursing pillow effectively. We cover its design, various feeding positions, and care instructions. My goal is to help you feel confident and comfortable during every feeding session.

### Takeaway:

*   **Secure the Pillow Correctly:** Position the My Brest Friend pillow snugly around your waist with the back support.
*   **Achieve Optimal Height:** Use the firm, flat surface to bring your baby to breast level.
*   **Master Key Positions:** Practice cradle, football, and cross-cradle holds for comfort and latch.

My Brest Friend nursing pillow wraps securely around your waist. It provides a firm, flat surface for your baby. This design brings your baby to the proper height for feeding, reducing back and neck strain for you. Adjust the back strap for a snug, custom fit, ensuring stable support for every nursing session.

## Understanding Your My Brest Friend Nursing Pillow's Design

My Brest Friend nursing pillow stands out with its unique design. This design focuses on supporting both mother and baby. The pillow has several features that make it a favorite among new parents. I found these features incredibly helpful during my own breastfeeding journey.

One key feature is the wrap-around design. This design secures the pillow to your body. It uses an adjustable silent-release strap. This strap prevents gaps between you and your baby. It also stops the pillow from sliding away during feeding. This ensures your baby stays close and supported throughout the entire session.

The pillow features a firm, flat surface. This flat surface is important for good positioning. It stops your baby from rolling towards or away from you. Your baby stays at breast height, which promotes a better latch. This firm support is a significant advantage over softer, less structured pillows.

Another thoughtful design element is the back support. This part of the pillow helps maintain good posture. It reduces strain on your back and shoulders. As a result, you can relax more during nursing. This makes feeding sessions more comfortable and enjoyable for both of you. Many pillows lack this crucial back support, making My Brest Friend special.

Finally, the pillow includes convenient pockets. These pockets are great for storing essentials. You can keep burp cloths, nipple cream, or your phone within easy reach. This small detail adds to the pillow's functionality. It helps keep your feeding area organized and tidy. Each design element works together to make breastfeeding easier and more comfortable.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Positioning Your My Brest Friend Pillow

Setting up your My Brest Friend nursing pillow correctly is the first step to successful feeding. Proper placement ensures comfort for you and a good latch for your baby. Let me walk you through how I set up my pillow every time. This will help you find your perfect fit.

First, sit in a comfortable chair or on a sofa. Ensure you have good back support yourself. Place the My Brest Friend pillow around your waist. The firm, flat platform should be in front of you. The back support part of the pillow should rest against your lower back.

Next, secure the adjustable strap behind your back. Pull the strap until the pillow feels snug and secure. You want it to fit closely against your body. This prevents any gaps between you and the pillow. The pillow should not move or slide around when you shift. A secure fit is important for keeping your baby stable.

Now, adjust the height of the pillow. The goal is to bring your baby's head to breast level without you having to lean forward. My Brest Friend's firm surface naturally provides good elevation. You can add a small cushion behind your back if you need a bit more height or forward lean. This helps you sit upright, which prevents back pain.

Remember, the goal is to make yourself comfortable first. Once the pillow is secure and at the right height, you can bring your baby to your breast. This pillow works wonders to simplify the process of positioning. Many new parents find learning [how do you use a breastfeeding pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-you-use-a-breastfeeding-pillow) a game-changer. It helps with consistent, comfortable feeding.

## Mastering Essential Breastfeeding Positions with the Pillow

My Brest Friend nursing pillow supports various breastfeeding positions. Each position offers unique benefits. Learning these positions helps you find what works best for you and your baby. I will explain how to use the pillow for some common holds.

### Cradle Hold

The cradle hold is a very common and natural position. To use the My Brest Friend pillow for this hold, first, secure the pillow around your waist. Bring your baby across your lap, facing you. Your baby's head will rest in the crook of your arm. The pillow supports your baby's body and takes their weight. This allows your arm to relax. Your baby's mouth should align with your nipple. Use your free hand to guide your baby to your breast.

### Football Hold

The football hold is great for mothers recovering from a C-section or those with large breasts. It also helps with twins. With the pillow on, place your baby on the pillow beside you. Their body should be tucked under your arm, like holding a football. Their feet point towards your back. Support your baby's head and neck with your hand. Guide your baby's nose to your nipple. The pillow keeps your baby elevated and secure, giving you more control over their head.

### Cross-Cradle Hold

The cross-cradle hold offers excellent control over your baby's head. This is helpful for newborns or babies with latching difficulties. Secure the pillow first. Place your baby across your lap, facing you. Use the arm *opposite* the breast you will feed from to support your baby's head. For example, if feeding from the right breast, use your left arm. Your hand should cup the back of your baby's head. Your other hand can gently compress your breast or offer support. The pillow supports your baby's body, freeing your arm to guide their head and ensure a good latch.

### Laid-Back/Reclined Position

While the My Brest Friend is primarily for upright feeding, you can adapt it for some laid-back positions. Instead of wrapping it completely, you might use it as an elevated base. Place it on your lap while you are reclined. Your baby can then rest on it, stomach to stomach with you. This can provide some elevation and stability. Always ensure your baby's airways are clear and they are secure. This position allows gravity to help your baby root and latch naturally.

Practicing these positions with your nursing pillow helps build confidence. It makes feeding time more comfortable for both of you. This specialized pillow provides fantastic support, regardless of the position.

## Ensuring Proper Latch and Baby Comfort

Achieving a proper latch is crucial for successful breastfeeding. It prevents pain for you and ensures your baby gets enough milk. My Brest Friend nursing pillow helps create the right conditions for a good latch. I always focus on these points to make sure my baby is feeding well.

First, bring your baby to your breast, not your breast to your baby. The firm surface of the My Brest Friend pillow allows you to do this easily. Your baby's nose should align with your nipple. Tickle their upper lip with your nipple to encourage them to open wide. When their mouth is open very wide, quickly bring them onto your breast.

Look for signs of a good latch. Your baby's mouth should be wide open, covering a good portion of the areola, not just the nipple. Their lips should be flanged out, like a fish. You should hear soft swallowing sounds, not clicking or smacking. Your baby's cheeks will look full and rounded. A deep latch prevents nipple pain and helps your baby empty the breast effectively.

Sometimes, troubleshooting is necessary. If you feel pain, gently break the latch and try again. Place a clean finger in the corner of your baby's mouth to break suction. Reposition your baby and try to achieve a deeper latch. Make sure your baby's body is facing you. Their head, neck, and body should be in a straight line. The My Brest Friend pillow helps maintain this alignment, which is key for comfortable swallowing.

Observe your baby during feeding. Are they calm and relaxed? Are their hands relaxed? These are good signs of comfort. If your baby seems fussy or pulls away often, adjust their position. The stability of the My Brest Friend pillow makes these adjustments easier. It helps you find that sweet spot where both of you are content. A happy baby and a comfortable mom make for wonderful feeding moments.

## Beyond Breastfeeding: Other Uses for Your My Brest Friend Pillow

My Brest Friend nursing pillow is incredibly versatile. While its primary role is breastfeeding support, it offers other helpful uses. I have discovered these extra benefits over time, making it an even more valuable item. This pillow can serve you and your baby in several ways.

One common alternative use is for bottle feeding. Sometimes, partners or other caregivers bottle feed the baby. The pillow provides the same stable platform for bottle feeding as it does for breastfeeding. This helps keep the baby at a comfortable height. It also reduces strain on the feeder's arms and back. Anyone can use the pillow to ensure a relaxed and ergonomic feeding experience.

Another potential use, with careful supervision, is for [how to use tummy time pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-tummy-time-pillow). While not a dedicated tummy time pillow, its firm, U-shaped design can offer mild elevation. You can place your baby over the pillow, supporting their chest and arms. This helps strengthen neck and upper body muscles. Always supervise your baby closely during tummy time. Make sure they can lift their head and breathe easily. The pillow's design provides a gentle incline, making tummy time a bit more enjoyable for some babies.

The My Brest Friend pillow can also provide back support for mom. After long feeding sessions, your back might feel tired. You can place the back support section of the pillow behind you while sitting. It offers extra lumbar support. This helps maintain good posture even when not actively nursing. It's a simple way to ease some postpartum discomfort.

Even when your baby outgrows nursing, the pillow can still be useful. Some parents use it for supporting their baby during sitting practice. The wrap-around design offers a soft barrier, preventing tips and falls. Always stay close to your baby during this stage. It helps them build strength while staying safe. The pillow's durability means it can last through many stages of your baby's growth.

## Cleaning and Maintaining Your My Brest Friend Nursing Pillow

Keeping your My Brest Friend nursing pillow clean is important. Spills and spit-ups are common during feeding. Regular cleaning ensures a hygienic environment for your baby. I make sure to clean my pillow often to keep it fresh.

The good news is that My Brest Friend pillows come with a removable slipcover. This cover is machine washable. First, gently unzip and remove the slipcover from the foam insert. Most covers are made from soft cotton or a blend. This makes them easy to care for.

Always check the care label on your specific slipcover. General instructions are usually to machine wash in cold water on a gentle cycle. Use a mild detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach, as these can damage the fabric. Washing in cold water helps prevent shrinking and fading.

After washing, tumble dry the slipcover on low heat. You can also air dry it. Air drying helps prolong the life of the fabric. Make sure the cover is completely dry before putting it back on the foam insert. A damp cover can encourage mildew growth. This step is essential for maintaining freshness.

The foam insert itself usually does not need frequent washing. If the foam gets wet or soiled, spot clean it immediately. Use a damp cloth with mild soap. Blot the area gently. Do not submerge the foam insert in water. This can damage its shape and integrity. Allow the spot-cleaned area to air dry completely. Ensure the foam is dry before replacing the slipcover.

Knowing [how to wash a pillow in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-pillow-in-the-washing-machine) is a useful skill. This applies to your nursing pillow cover too. If you are curious about different materials, understanding [can you wash a cotton pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-a-cotton-pillow) might help.
