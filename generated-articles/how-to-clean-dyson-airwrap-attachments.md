## Unlock Longevity: How To Clean Dyson Airwrap Attachments for Peak Performance

I love my Dyson Airwrap. It changed my hair styling routine completely. This powerful tool relies on its unique attachments to create different styles. If you own an Airwrap, you know how indispensable these parts are. Over time, hair products, dust, and natural oils build up on them. This residue affects performance and hygiene.

Learning how to clean Dyson Airwrap attachments properly is crucial. It ensures your tool continues to deliver salon-quality results. Regular cleaning also protects your investment, extending the life of each attachment. In this guide, I will walk you through everything you need to know. We will cover why cleaning matters, the tools required, and step-by-step instructions for each attachment. I will also share tips for common issues and vital maintenance practices.

### Takeaway

*   Regular cleaning prevents product buildup and hair entanglement.
*   Use mild soap, water, and soft cloths or brushes for most attachments.
*   Always disconnect the Airwrap from power before cleaning.
*   Ensure attachments are completely dry before reattaching.
*   Clean the Airwrap filter regularly for optimal performance.

To clean Dyson Airwrap attachments, first disconnect the device from power. Then, use a soft, damp cloth with mild soap to wipe down smooth surfaces. Remove tangled hair from brushes using a small brush or comb. Rinse bristles gently, avoiding submerging electronic components. Let all parts air dry completely before reassembly.

## Why Regular Cleaning Matters for Your Dyson Airwrap Attachments

Your Dyson Airwrap is a premium styling device. Its effectiveness comes from airflow and precision-engineered attachments. Over time, these attachments collect various substances. Hair products like serums, mousses, and hairsprays leave sticky residues. Natural oils from your hair and scalp also transfer onto the barrels and brushes. Dust and lint are another common culprit.

This accumulation of grime creates several problems. First, it can block the airflow. This reduces the Coanda effect, which is how the Airwrap styles hair using air. When airflow is restricted, your styling results will suffer. You might notice your curls don't hold as well, or your hair doesn't smooth efficiently. Second, product buildup can make attachments feel sticky or greasy. This transfers residue back to your hair during styling.

Third, hygiene is a significant concern. Uncleaned attachments can harbor bacteria and fungi. Using dirty tools on your clean hair is counterproductive. It can lead to scalp irritation or transfer unwanted grime. Finally, neglect shortens the lifespan of your expensive attachments. The bristles on brushes can become stiff or clumpy. The smooth surfaces of curling barrels might lose their shine. Regular cleaning maintains their pristine condition and protects your investment.

Proper cleaning ensures consistent performance. It keeps your Airwrap working as it should, delivering beautiful results every time. It also means less frustration during your styling routine. A clean tool is a happy tool, and it makes your hair happy too. My experience shows that well-maintained tools last longer and perform better.

## Essential Tools and Preparations for Cleaning Your Airwrap Attachments

Before you begin cleaning your Dyson Airwrap attachments, gather the necessary items. Having everything ready saves time and ensures a smooth process. You likely have most of these items at home already. Using the right tools also prevents accidental damage to your delicate attachments.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Soft, lint-free cloths:** Microfiber cloths work best. They are gentle and absorbent.
*   **Mild soap or shampoo:** A gentle dish soap or even a mild hair shampoo is suitable. Avoid harsh detergents.
*   **Small, soft-bristle brush:** An old toothbrush or a specialized cleaning brush works well for bristles.
*   **Small comb or hair pick:** This is essential for removing tangled hair from brushes.
*   **A bowl or shallow basin:** For soaking certain parts if needed.
*   **Clean, dry towel:** For initial drying of parts.
*   **Cotton swabs or Q-tips:** Useful for reaching small crevices.
*   **Dyson filter cleaning brush:** Your Airwrap comes with this specific brush for its filter. Do not forget to use it. Many people overlook cleaning the main unit's filter, but it is just as important as cleaning the attachments themselves. You can learn more about this process by visiting our guide on [how to clean Dyson Airwrap filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dyson-airwrap-filter).

Before you start, always unplug your Dyson Airwrap from the power outlet. This is a critical safety step. Never attempt to clean any electronic device while it is connected to electricity. Detach all the styling attachments from the main unit. Lay them out on a clean, flat surface. A towel-covered counter or table works well. This preparation ensures you have a safe and organized cleaning experience. Remember, gentle care is key to preserving these high-quality tools.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Cleaning Different Airwrap Attachments

Cleaning different Dyson Airwrap attachments requires specific approaches. Each attachment has a unique design and material. Understanding these differences helps you clean them effectively and safely. I will break down the cleaning process for the most common attachments.

### Cleaning the Coanda Smoothing Dryer

The Coanda smoothing dryer is often used first in a styling routine. It usually gets less product buildup than styling brushes.
1.  **Detach:** Remove the smoothing dryer from the main Airwrap unit.
2.  **Wipe Down:** Use a soft, damp cloth with a small amount of mild soap. Gently wipe the entire surface of the attachment. Pay attention to the grilles and openings where air passes through.
3.  **Rinse:** Dampen a fresh cloth with plain water. Wipe again to remove any soap residue.
4.  **Dry:** Use a dry, lint-free cloth to remove excess moisture. Allow it to air dry completely on a clean towel.

### Cleaning the Curling Barrels

The curling barrels are where product residue often builds up. This can make them feel sticky.
1.  **Detach:** Remove the curling barrels from the Airwrap. You likely have different sizes.
2.  **Soak (Optional):** For stubborn buildup, you can lightly dampen a soft cloth with warm water and a tiny bit of mild soap. Wrap it around the barrel for a few minutes. This helps loosen residue. Do not submerge the entire barrel in water.
3.  **Wipe Clean:** Use a soft, damp cloth with mild soap. Wipe along the surface of the barrel. Use a cotton swab for the small holes around the barrel. These holes are crucial for airflow.
4.  **Rinse and Dry:** Wipe with a clean, damp cloth to remove soap. Then, dry with a soft towel and allow to air dry fully. Ensure no moisture remains inside the barrel openings.

### Cleaning the Round Volumizing Brush

The round volumizing brush can accumulate hair and product.
1.  **Remove Hair:** Use a small comb or your fingers to gently pull out any tangled hair from the bristles. Start from the outer edges and work inwards.
2.  **Brush Cleaning:** Dip a soft-bristle brush (like an old toothbrush) into a bowl of warm water with mild soap. Gently brush the bristles of the volumizing brush. Focus on removing product buildup. Avoid getting the base of the brush too wet where it connects to the main unit.
3.  **Rinse:** Rinse the bristles under a very light stream of water, pointing the bristles downwards. This prevents water from entering the brush's interior.
4.  **Dry:** Shake off excess water. Lay the brush bristles-down on a clean towel to air dry. Ensure it is completely dry before storage or use.

### Cleaning the Firm and Soft Smoothing Brushes

These brushes are similar to the volumizing brush in cleaning needs.
1.  **Remove Hair:** Use a small comb or your fingers to remove all tangled hair from the bristles.
2.  **Brush Cleaning:** Follow the same process as the round volumizing brush. Dip a soft-bristle brush in mild soapy water. Gently scrub the bristles to remove product and grime.
3.  **Rinse:** Rinse the bristles under a very light stream of water. Point the brush downwards to prevent water from entering the attachment's body.
4.  **Dry:** Shake off excess water. Lay the brush bristles-down on a clean towel. Allow it to air dry completely. Proper drying is crucial for preventing mold or mildew.

Remember, patience and gentleness are key for all attachments. Your Dyson Airwrap is an investment, and careful cleaning keeps it performing beautifully.

## Deep Cleaning and Troubleshooting Common Issues

Sometimes, a simple wipe-down is not enough. Stubborn buildup or lingering smells might require a deeper approach. Addressing common issues during cleaning ensures your Dyson Airwrap attachments remain in top condition. I often find a thorough clean makes a surprising difference in performance.

### Tackling Stubborn Residue

For very sticky or caked-on product buildup:
*   **Warm Water Soak:** For plastic parts and bristles, a short soak can help. Fill a shallow basin with warm (not hot) water and a few drops of mild soap. Submerge only the parts that are safe for water. Avoid getting any electrical components wet. Let them soak for 10-15 minutes.
*   **Gentle Scrubbing:** After soaking, use a soft-bristle brush or a clean cloth to gently scrub away the loosened residue. For curling barrels, cotton swabs can reach into the small airflow holes.
*   **Isopropyl Alcohol (Use with Caution):** For extremely stubborn, non-water-soluble residue on hard plastic surfaces, a very small amount of isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab can be effective. Test it on an inconspicuous area first. Avoid using it on rubber or soft-touch finishes, as it can cause damage. Always ensure good ventilation if using alcohol.

### Addressing Odors

If your attachments develop an unpleasant odor, it is usually due to product buildup or moisture.
*   **Thorough Cleaning:** A comprehensive cleaning, as described above, is the first step. Ensure all product residue is gone.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** For non-electrical parts (like plastic brush bases, if removable and safe), a paste of baking soda and water can absorb odors. Apply the paste, let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly.
*   **Air Drying:** The most critical step for odor prevention is complete drying. Trapped moisture leads to mildew and smells. Always allow attachments to air dry fully, preferably in a well-ventilated area. My trick is to let them sit overnight.

### Bristle Restoration

Over time, brush bristles can become stiff or splayed.
*   **Warm Water Soak:** A brief soak in warm, soapy water can help soften bristles.
*   **Gently Reshape:** While still damp, gently reshape the bristles with your fingers.
*   **Dry Flat:** Let the brush dry flat on a towel, bristles facing down. This helps maintain their shape as they dry.

By taking these extra steps, you can restore your attachments to near-new condition. Regular maintenance prevents these deeper issues from becoming chronic. Remember that your Airwrap's performance is directly tied to the cleanliness of its components.

## Frequency and Best Practices for Airwrap Attachment Maintenance

Establishing a regular cleaning routine for your Dyson Airwrap attachments is key to their longevity and performance. I find that consistent, smaller efforts prevent the need for more intensive deep cleans. Think of it like brushing your teeth daily; it prevents bigger problems later.

### How Often Should You Clean?

The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you use your Airwrap and the types of products you use.
*   **Quick Wipe-Down (After Every Use):** I recommend a quick wipe of the main body and the immediately visible parts of the attachments after each styling session. This prevents fresh product from drying and hardening. Use a soft, dry cloth.
*   **Light Clean (Weekly or Bi-Weekly):** If you use your Airwrap a few times a week, a light clean of all attachments is beneficial. This involves removing tangled hair and a quick wipe with a damp, soapy cloth.
*   **Deep Clean (Monthly or Bi-Monthly):** For heavy users or those who use a lot of styling products, a thorough deep clean of all attachments is ideal every month or two. This includes the soaking and scrubbing steps.

### Best Practices for Maintenance

*   **Always Unplug:** Before any cleaning, ensure the Airwrap is unplugged from the power source. This is a crucial safety measure.
*   **Dry Completely:** Never reattach wet attachments to your Airwrap. Moisture can damage the internal components or lead to mold growth. Allow ample air drying time, typically several hours or overnight.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your clean, dry attachments in their original case or a clean, dry place. This protects them from dust and physical damage.
*   **Clean the Filter:** Do not forget the main unit's filter. A clogged filter restricts airflow to the attachments. Dyson provides a specific brush for this purpose. Refer to your Airwrap manual or our guide on [how to clean Dyson Airwrap filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-airwrap-filter) for detailed instructions. A clean filter ensures the tool operates at its peak.
*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Bleach, abrasive cleaners, or industrial solvents can damage the plastic and finishes of your attachments. Stick to mild soap and water.
*   **Check for Wear:** During cleaning, inspect attachments for any signs of wear or damage. Early detection can prevent further issues.

By following these best practices, your Dyson Airwrap attachments will serve you well for years. A little routine maintenance goes a long way.

## Beyond the Attachments: The Importance of Cleaning Your Airwrap Filter

While cleaning your Dyson Airwrap attachments is crucial, there is another vital component often overlooked: the main unit's filter. This filter is the heart of your Airwrap's powerful airflow system. It needs regular attention to keep your tool performing at its best. I have seen firsthand how much a clean filter improves styling results.

The Dyson Airwrap, like many high-performance Dyson products, draws air through a filter at the base of the handle. This filter traps dust, lint, and hair particles from the surrounding environment. Without this filter, these particles would enter the motor, causing damage and reducing efficiency. Think of it like the air filter in your car. A dirty filter chokes the engine.

When the Airwrap's filter becomes clogged, airflow into the device is restricted. This directly impacts the Coanda effect, which is how the Airwrap styles hair. You might notice your curls are not forming as easily, or the smoothing brushes feel less effective. The tool might also sound different, straining to pull air through the blocked filter. Overheating can also occur, and in some cases, the device might even shut down as a safety measure. My own experience taught me that filter maintenance is not optional.

Dyson provides a special brush with your Airwrap specifically for cleaning this filter.
Here is how to clean it:
1.  **Unplug:** Always unplug your Airwrap from the power outlet.
2.  **Locate Filter:** The filter cage is at the bottom of the Airwrap handle.
3.  **Twist Off:** Gently twist the filter cage counter-clockwise to remove it.
4.  **Brush Clean:** Use the provided Dyson filter cleaning brush. Slide it over the mesh filter. Move it up and down and rotate it to dislodge dust and lint.
5.  **Tap Out Debris:** Tap the filter cage gently against a hard surface to release any remaining debris.
6.  **Rinse (If Necessary):** If the filter is extremely dirty, you can rinse the outer mesh under cold running water. Ensure it is completely dry before reattaching. This is usually only for extreme cases, and you must avoid getting water inside the main unit.
7.  **Reattach:** Once completely clean and dry, slide the filter cage back onto the handle. Twist clockwise to secure it.

Cleaning the Airwrap filter should be done regularly, perhaps weekly or bi-weekly depending on usage. It is as important as cleaning the attachments. For general Dyson filter maintenance, you might also find insights in our guide on [how to clean a Dyson air filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dyson-air-filter). Keeping both the attachments and the filter clean ensures your Dyson Airwrap delivers optimal performance and lasts for years to come.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Your Dyson Airwrap

Cleaning your Dyson Airwrap attachments seems straightforward, but certain mistakes can damage your valuable tools. I have learned these lessons over time. Avoiding these pitfalls will ensure your cleaning efforts are effective and safe.

1.  **Submerging the Entire Attachment:** Many attachments contain internal components or electronics that are not waterproof. Submerging them can cause irreparable damage. Always refer to the manual for specific water-safe parts. Stick to wiping or rinsing only the outer, non-electrical parts.
2.  **Using Harsh Chemicals or Abrasives:** Bleach, ammonia-based cleaners, abrasive scrubs, or even harsh dish soaps can degrade the plastic, metal, and coatings on your attachments. These chemicals can strip protective layers or cause discoloration. Always use mild, pH-neutral soaps.
3.  **Not Unplugging the Device:** This is a fundamental safety rule. Cleaning any electrical appliance while it is plugged in poses an electric shock hazard. Always unplug your Dyson Airwrap from the power outlet before you start cleaning any part of it.
4.  **Neglecting the Main Unit Filter:** Many people focus only on the styling attachments. However, a clogged main filter drastically reduces performance and can strain the motor. Make filter cleaning a regular part of your maintenance routine. Dyson provides a tool specifically for this. Ignoring the filter is like ignoring the engine of a car. You can also review how to generally clean other Dyson filters, for instance, [how to clean a HEPA filter Dyson](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-hepa-filter-dyson), to understand the importance of filter maintenance across Dyson products.
5.  **Not Drying Attachments Completely:** Reattaching or storing wet attachments can lead to several problems. Moisture can cause mold or mildew growth, which creates unpleasant odors and can be unhealthy. It can also cause corrosion on metal parts or short-circuit electrical components if any moisture reaches them. Always allow attachments to air dry thoroughly, often overnight.
6.  **Rough Handling:** Dyson attachments are durable but not indestructible. Prying off hair with sharp objects or scrubbing too vigorously can scratch surfaces or damage delicate bristles. Be gentle and use the recommended soft tools.
7.  **Ignoring the Inside of the Barrels:** The curling barrels have small holes for airflow. Product buildup inside these holes can restrict the Coanda effect. Use cotton swabs to gently clean these openings.

By being mindful of these common errors, you can keep your Dyson Airwrap attachments pristine and functional for years. Proper care is an investment in your styling tools.
