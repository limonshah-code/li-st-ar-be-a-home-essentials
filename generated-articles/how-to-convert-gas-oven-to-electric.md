Start by consulting your oven's user manual. It contains specific cleaning instructions and maintenance recommendations for your model. I always read my appliance manuals thoroughly; they contain valuable insights.

Many electric ovens come with a self-cleaning feature. This function superheats the oven interior, turning baked-on food into ash. Run the self-clean cycle periodically, perhaps every few months or as needed. Always ensure good ventilation during this cycle, as it can produce some smoke and odors. After the cycle cools, simply wipe away the ash with a damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemical cleaners, especially on the heating elements or interior surfaces, as they can cause damage.

Regularly clean the oven racks and interior walls. A mixture of baking soda and water can create a paste effective for stubborn stains. For the stovetop, if you have an electric range, wipe spills immediately to prevent them from baking on. For glass-ceramic cooktops, use a specialized cleaner and non-abrasive scrubber to avoid scratching. Inspect the heating elements periodically. Ensure they are free from food debris or damage. If an element appears faulty, consider having it replaced by a professional.

Check the oven door seal or gasket. A tight seal helps maintain consistent temperatures and energy efficiency. If the seal is torn or worn, it can lead to heat loss. This makes your oven work harder and consume more energy. Replacing a damaged door seal is a relatively simple repair that can significantly improve oven performance.

Finally, ensure proper ventilation in your kitchen. While electric ovens do not produce combustion byproducts like gas ovens, they still generate heat and some cooking odors. A good range hood helps clear the air and prevents grease buildup. Long-term care involves being mindful of spills and promptly addressing any performance issues. This ensures your electric oven continues to be a reliable workhorse in your kitchen for many years.
