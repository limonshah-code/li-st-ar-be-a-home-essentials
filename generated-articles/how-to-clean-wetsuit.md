## Keep Your Wetsuit Pristine: A Guide to Cleaning and Care

Imagine slipping into a fresh, clean wetsuit before a great surf session or dive. Does your current wetsuit smell a bit funky? Or do you see some unwanted spots forming? Keeping your wetsuit clean is very important.

As someone who loves water sports, I know how much we rely on our gear. A well-maintained wetsuit protects you and performs better. Learning how to clean wetsuit correctly helps it last longer. It also keeps away bad smells and harmful bacteria. This article will show you simple steps to wash, dry, and store your wetsuit. You will keep it in top shape for many adventures to come. Let's get into the details to make your wetsuit feel new again.

### Takeaway:

*   Rinse your wetsuit with fresh water after every use.
*   Use a wetsuit-specific cleaner or mild soap for deeper cleaning.
*   Dry your wetsuit inside out in the shade, avoiding direct sunlight.
*   Store your wetsuit flat or on a wide hanger to prevent creases.
*   Address odors and mold quickly to protect your gear.

To clean a wetsuit, rinse it with fresh water immediately after use to remove salt, sand, and chlorine. For a deeper clean, wash it by hand with a wetsuit-specific shampoo or mild soap, rinse thoroughly, and hang it to dry inside out in a cool, shaded area away from direct sunlight.

## Why Regular Wetsuit Cleaning Matters

Cleaning your wetsuit goes beyond just making it smell nice. Regular cleaning protects your investment. Wetsuits are expensive pieces of equipment. Proper care ensures they perform well and last many years.

Saltwater, chlorine, sand, and even body oils can damage the neoprene material over time. These elements break down the glue and seams, making your wetsuit less effective. A clean wetsuit maintains its flexibility and warmth. It helps you stay comfortable in the water. Neglecting to clean it shortens its life.

### Protecting Your Investment

Your wetsuit works hard to keep you warm and agile in the water. After each use, it collects various elements. Saltwater can dry out the neoprene, making it stiff and brittle. Chlorine from pools breaks down the material even faster. Sand and grit cause abrasion, wearing away the fabric. These issues lead to tears and leaks over time.

A clean wetsuit keeps its stretchy feel. It fits better and offers better insulation. This means you stay warmer and more comfortable during your activities. Think of cleaning as a shield for your wetsuit. It defends against wear and tear.

### Preventing Odor and Bacteria Growth

The inside of a wetsuit gets warm and moist. This creates a perfect place for bacteria and mold to grow. Sweat, body oils, and stagnant water all add to this problem. A dirty wetsuit often develops a strong, unpleasant smell. This smell comes from bacterial growth.

Mold can also grow on wetsuits if they are not dried correctly. Mold not only smells bad but also harms the fabric. It causes discoloration and weakens the material. Regular cleaning removes these harmful elements. It stops smells and mold from forming. A clean wetsuit means a healthier, happier you. You do not want to wear something full of germs.

## Essential Supplies for Wetsuit Care

Before you start cleaning, gather the right tools. You do not need many items. The right supplies make the job easy and effective. Using the wrong products can harm your wetsuit.

Always choose gentle cleaners. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach or strong detergents. These can damage the neoprene and seams. Having everything ready saves you time and effort. It ensures a safe cleaning process for your gear.

### What You Will Need

You will need a few simple things for proper wetsuit cleaning. These items are easy to find. Some are probably already in your home. Let's make sure you have the basics ready.

*   **Fresh Water:** This is the most important item. A hose or a large bucket works well. You need plenty of fresh, cool water for rinsing.
*   **Wetsuit Cleaner or Mild Soap:** Specific wetsuit shampoos are best. They are designed for neoprene. If you do not have one, a very mild, pH-neutral soap like baby shampoo can work. Avoid strong laundry detergents.
*   **Large Bucket or Tub:** This is for soaking and washing. A clean plastic tub or even your bathtub can serve this purpose.
*   **Wide Hanger:** A plastic or wooden hanger with wide shoulders is crucial. This prevents creases and stretches. Do not use thin wire hangers. They can damage the neoprene.
*   **Soft Cloth or Sponge:** For gently wiping away dirt or small stains.
*   **Optional: Wetsuit Deodorizer:** For persistent odors, after cleaning.

## Step-by-Step Wetsuit Cleaning Process

Cleaning your wetsuit is not hard. It involves a few simple steps. Following these steps helps you get the best results. A clean wetsuit feels better to wear. It also lasts much longer.

Remember to be gentle throughout the process. Neoprene is a durable material, but it can be damaged by rough handling. Take your time to ensure a thorough clean. Your wetsuit will thank you for it.

### Immediate Post-Use Rinse

This is the first and most important step after every use. Do not skip it. Even if you only swam for a short time, a quick rinse is vital.

1.  **Rinse Outside First:** Use cool, fresh water. A garden hose is perfect. Rinse the entire outside of your wetsuit. Remove all visible sand, salt, or dirt.
2.  **Rinse Inside Next:** Turn your wetsuit inside out. Rinse the inside thoroughly. Pay attention to areas that were in direct contact with your body. This removes sweat and body oils.
3.  **Use Cool Water:** Always use cool or lukewarm water. Hot water can damage the neoprene. It breaks down the material's elasticity. This step alone removes most contaminants.

### Deep Cleaning Your Wetsuit

Periodically, your wetsuit needs a deeper clean. This is especially true if it starts to smell or feels sticky. Aim for a deep clean every few uses, or monthly depending on how often you wear it. This process helps tackle bacteria and tougher grime.

1.  **Prepare a Bath:** Fill a large bucket or tub with cool water. Add a capful of wetsuit cleaner or a few drops of mild soap. Stir the water to mix the cleaner evenly.
2.  **Submerge and Soak:** Turn your wetsuit inside out. Fully submerge it in the soapy water. Gently press it down to remove air bubbles. Let it soak for 15-30 minutes. This helps loosen dirt and kill bacteria.
3.  **Gentle Scrub:** After soaking, gently scrub any soiled areas with a soft cloth or sponge. Do not use abrasive brushes. Pay attention to high-contact areas like the neck and armpits. For cleaning other worn items, you might find tips on [how to clean water shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-water-shoes).
4.  **Thorough Rinse (Inside and Out):** Drain the soapy water. Rinse the wetsuit thoroughly with fresh, cool water. Make sure all soap residue is gone. Rinse the inside and then the outside. Leftover soap can irritate your skin and degrade the neoprene. Think of it like rinsing dishes; you want them squeaky clean.
5.  **Press Out Excess Water:** Do not wring your wetsuit. Wringing can damage the neoprene fibers and seams. Gently gather the wetsuit and press it against the side of the tub or floor. This removes most of the water.

## Proper Wetsuit Drying Techniques

Drying your wetsuit correctly is as important as cleaning it. Incorrect drying methods can lead to damage. They can also cause lingering odors and mold growth. Patience is key here.

Never use high heat. Direct sunlight and machine dryers are bad for wetsuits. They will make your wetsuit stiff and reduce its lifespan. Follow these steps for optimal drying.

### Best Practices for Drying

Drying your wetsuit protects its material. It also keeps it fresh for the next use. This process prevents many common problems.

1.  **Inside Out First:** Always start by hanging your wetsuit inside out. This allows the inner lining, which absorbs more sweat and body oils, to dry first. It also protects the outer surface from direct exposure during the initial drying phase.
2.  **Choose a Shady Spot:** Hang your wetsuit in a cool, well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight. UV rays from the sun can degrade neoprene very quickly. It causes the material to become brittle and lose its flexibility. A shady porch, garage, or even a spacious bathroom works well.
3.  **Use a Wide Hanger:** Hang the wetsuit over a wide hanger. A special wetsuit hanger or a sturdy plastic coat hanger is ideal. Do not use thin wire hangers. They create sharp creases and can stretch the shoulders of your wetsuit. Hanging it at the waist folded over a bar is also an option if your hanger is not wide enough for the shoulders.
4.  **Allow Air Circulation:** Ensure good airflow around the wetsuit. Do not let it touch walls or other items. This helps it dry evenly and quickly.
5.  **Flip It:** Once the inside is mostly dry (after several hours or overnight), turn the wetsuit right side out. Continue to hang it in the shady, well-ventilated spot until the outside is completely dry. This ensures both sides are thoroughly dry. This method helps prevent mold. You can also apply similar mold prevention tactics for other items, such as learning [how to clean mold off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes).
6.  **Patience is Key:** Wetsuits can take 24 hours or more to dry completely, depending on humidity and temperature. Do not rush the process. A damp wetsuit will develop a smell and mold.

## Long-Term Wetsuit Storage

Once your wetsuit is perfectly clean and dry, proper storage ensures its longevity. Incorrect storage can lead to creases, material degradation, and even permanent damage. Think about where your wetsuit will spend most of its time when not in use.

A good storage method keeps the neoprene supple and ready for your next adventure. Avoid extreme temperatures and cramped spaces. Proper storage is the final step in a complete wetsuit care routine.

### Ideal Storage Conditions

Where and how you store your wetsuit makes a big difference. These practices keep it in top shape. You want to avoid any stresses on the material.

1.  **Completely Dry First:** Never store a damp wetsuit. This invites mold, mildew, and bad smells. Ensure it is bone dry, inside and out, before putting it away. For methods on drying materials, sometimes similar principles can apply as when learning [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes) thoroughly.
2.  **Flat or Wide Hanger:** The best way to store a wetsuit long-term is flat. You can lay it flat under a bed or in a large box. If hanging, use a very wide, padded hanger. Avoid folding it sharply or hanging it by the shoulders on a thin hanger. This prevents creases and stretched neoprene. Creases can become permanent.
3.  **Cool, Dry Place:** Store your wetsuit in a cool, dry environment. Basements can be too damp, attics too hot. A closet or a spare room is often ideal. Avoid direct sunlight or extreme temperature fluctuations.
4.  **Away from Chemicals:** Keep your wetsuit away from gasoline, solvents, and other harsh chemicals. These can severely damage the neoprene.
5.  **Avoid Compressing:** Do not store your wetsuit in a compressed state. This can damage the foam cells within the neoprene. Give it room to breathe.
6.  **Consider a Storage Bag:** A breathable garment bag can protect your wetsuit from dust and pests. Do not use airtight plastic bags, as they can trap moisture and promote mold.

## Tackling Common Wetsuit Problems

Even with regular cleaning, your wetsuit might face specific issues. Bad smells, mold, and stubborn stains are common concerns. Knowing how to address these problems can save your wetsuit.

Acting fast when you notice a problem is key. Ignoring these issues makes them harder to fix later. These methods help restore your wetsuit to its best condition.

### Dealing with Odor and Mold

Persistent smells and mold are signs of bacterial or fungal growth. They need targeted treatment. Do not just mask the smell; eliminate the source. For cleaning mold in other areas, you might want to look at [how to clean mold in shower](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-shower) for general strategies.

1.  **Odor Removal:**
    *   **Wetsuit Deodorizer:** Many brands offer specific wetsuit deodorizers or shampoos with odor-eliminating properties. Follow the product instructions.
    *   **White Vinegar Soak:** For stubborn odors, a diluted white vinegar solution can work wonders. Mix one part white vinegar with three parts cool water in a tub. Submerge your wetsuit for 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly afterwards. Vinegar is a natural deodorizer and mild disinfectant. Similarly, vinegar is useful in many household cleaning tasks, such as when learning [how to clean mold with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar).
    *   **Baking Soda:** Sprinkle baking soda inside the dry wetsuit and let it sit overnight. Then shake it out or rinse lightly. Baking soda absorbs odors.
2.  **Mold Removal:**
    *   **Vinegar Solution:** For visible mold spots, use a slightly stronger vinegar solution (one part vinegar to one part water). Gently wipe the affected area with a soft cloth soaked in the solution.
    *   **Sunlight (Briefly):** While direct prolonged sunlight is bad, a very brief exposure (15-30 minutes) to mild sunlight can help kill mold spores. Do this *after* cleaning and rinsing, and ensure it's not intense midday sun.
    *   **Thorough Drying:** After treating mold, ensure the wetsuit dries completely. Good airflow is critical. Mold on plastics and rubbers can be tenacious, so consider tips on [how to clean mold off plastic](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-plastic) for more general approaches to these materials.

### Removing Stubborn Stains

Some stains are harder to remove. Oil, grease, or mud might require extra attention. Always try the gentlest method first.

1.  **Spot Clean:** For small, specific stains, try spot cleaning. Apply a tiny amount of wetsuit cleaner or mild soap directly to the stain. Gently rub with a soft cloth.
2.  **Rinse and Repeat:** Rinse the area thoroughly. If the stain remains, repeat the process. Do not rub too aggressively, as this can damage the neoprene surface.
3.  **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Never use bleach, paint thinner, or strong spot removers. These chemicals can dissolve the glue, crack the neoprene, or remove dyes.
4.  **Oil/Grease Stains:** For oil-based stains, a small amount of dish soap can sometimes break down the grease. Apply, gently rub, and rinse well. Always test on an inconspicuous area first.

## Common Wetsuit Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid

Caring for your wetsuit seems simple, but some common mistakes can drastically reduce its lifespan. Knowing what not to do is just as important as knowing what to do. Avoid these pitfalls to keep your wetsuit performing well for years.

These mistakes often involve heat, harsh chemicals, or improper handling. They can lead to irreparable damage. Learn from these warnings to protect your valuable gear.

### What Not to Do

These actions cause significant damage to neoprene. Always remember these warnings. They help you save money in the long run.

*   **Do Not Use Hot Water:** Hot water degrades neoprene. It breaks down the glue in seams. Always use cool or lukewarm water for washing and rinsing. This keeps the material flexible and strong.
*   **Do Not Use Harsh Chemicals:** Bleach, laundry detergent, fabric softener, strong solvents, or petroleum-based cleaners are a big no. They strip the neoprene of its natural oils. This makes it brittle and can dissolve the seams. Stick to specialized wetsuit cleaners or very mild, pH-neutral soap.
*   **Do Not Machine Wash or Dry:** Washing machines can stretch, tear, or damage wetsuits. The agitation is too rough. Machine dryers, especially with heat, will melt and shrink neoprene. Always hand wash and air dry.
*   **Do Not Dry in Direct Sunlight:** UV rays are very harmful to neoprene. They cause fading, cracking, and brittleness. Always dry your wetsuit in a shaded, well-ventilated area.
*   **Do Not Hang on Thin Wire Hangers:** Wire hangers create sharp pressure points. These can permanently crease the neoprene. They can also stretch out the shoulders. Use a wide, padded hanger or fold it over a large, flat surface.
*   **Do Not Wring Out Water:** Twisting or wringing your wetsuit can damage the neoprene and seams. Gently press out excess water instead.
*   **Do Not Iron:** Ironing a wetsuit will melt the neoprene. This is a common mistake for those unfamiliar with wetsuit material. It is completely unnecessary.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Wetsuit Cleaning

Many people have questions about wetsuit care. Here are answers to some common queries. These insights help clarify the best practices for maintaining your gear. Understanding these points extends the life of your wetsuit.

### How often should I clean my wetsuit?

You should rinse your wetsuit with fresh water after every single use. A deeper wash with wetsuit cleaner is needed every 3-5 uses, or if it starts to smell or looks dirty. If you use it frequently in saltwater, more frequent deep cleaning is beneficial. Consistency is key to long-term care.

### Can I use regular laundry detergent on my wetsuit?
