## How To Get Pet Smell Out Of Carpet Steam Cleaner

A clean home feels great. Pet owners know the joy pets bring. But sometimes, pet accidents happen on carpets. We use a carpet steam cleaner to clean these messes. Then a new problem starts: the steam cleaner itself begins to smell like pets. This can be very frustrating.

I know this problem well. My own carpet cleaner has had this issue. That stale pet odor can come back into your home if your machine is not clean. This article shows you how to remove pet smells from your carpet steam cleaner. We will cover cleaning tanks, hoses, and brushes. We will also discuss prevention. You can have a fresh-smelling machine again.

### Takeaway: Get Your Steam Cleaner Fresh Again

*   Empty and rinse tanks immediately after each use.
*   Deep clean tanks with vinegar or baking soda solutions.
*   Disassemble and scrub hoses, nozzles, and brush heads.
*   Use enzymatic cleaners to break down deep-set pet odors.
*   Allow all parts to air dry completely before storing your machine.
*   Follow a regular maintenance schedule to prevent future smells.

To get pet smell out of a carpet steam cleaner, empty and rinse all tanks thoroughly after each use. Then, deep clean the dirty water tank with a vinegar or baking soda solution. Disassemble and wash hoses and attachments. Allow all parts to air dry completely before storing the machine. This process removes odor-causing bacteria and residues.

### Why Your Carpet Cleaner Smells Like Pet Odor

Have you ever noticed a bad smell coming from your carpet cleaner? It often happens after cleaning pet messes. This odor is usually not from your carpet. It comes from the machine itself.

Pet accidents leave behind residues. These residues contain bacteria. When you clean, your machine picks up these elements. The dirty water tank becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. These bacteria multiply quickly in a warm, moist place. They produce the strong pet odor you smell.

Pet dander and hair also get trapped. They stick to hoses and brushes. These organic materials break down over time. This breakdown also creates bad smells. If you do not clean your machine properly, the smell builds up. It will then transfer back to your carpets. Proper cleaning stops this cycle. It keeps your home and machine smelling fresh.

### Immediate Steps to Remove Pet Smells

The best way to fight pet odors is to act fast. Right after cleaning a pet mess, you must take certain steps. This prevents the smell from setting in. I always do this myself.

First, empty the dirty water tank immediately. Do not let the dirty water sit. It contains pet waste and bacteria. Leaving it there makes the smell worse. Pour the dirty water down the drain.

Next, rinse both the dirty water tank and the solution tank. Use hot water for this. Swish the hot water around inside the tanks. This removes loose dirt and residue. You can add a little bit of dish soap to the rinse water for extra cleaning. Make sure to rinse again with clear water to remove all soap. This simple step makes a big difference. It stops pet smells before they start.

### Deep Cleaning Your Steam Cleaner's Tanks

Sometimes, immediate rinsing is not enough. You need to deep clean the tanks. The dirty water tank is the main culprit. It holds all the pet messes. This tank needs special attention.

You can use white vinegar to deep clean. Fill the dirty water tank with equal parts white vinegar and hot water. Let this solution sit for 30 minutes to an hour. Vinegar is a natural deodorizer and disinfectant. It helps break down tough smells. After soaking, scrub the inside of the tank with a brush. Make sure to reach all corners. Then, rinse it very well with clean water.

Baking soda also works wonders. Make a paste with baking soda and a little water. Spread this paste inside the dirty water tank. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Baking soda absorbs odors. Scrub the paste with a brush. Then rinse thoroughly. Do not forget the clean water tank. Even clean water can grow bacteria if left too long. Rinse and wipe it out too.

### Sanitizing Hoses, Attachments, and Brush Heads

The tanks are important, but other parts also trap pet smells. Hoses, nozzles, and brush heads gather pet hair and residue. If these parts are not clean, the odor will stay. I learned this the hard way with my first machine.

You need to take these parts off your cleaner. Most machines allow you to remove them easily. Once removed, rinse them under hot running water. You might see pet hair caught in the brushes. Pull out any trapped hair. Use a small brush or even an old toothbrush to scrub these parts. Get into all the small crevices.

For a deeper clean, soak these parts. Fill a basin with hot water and a cup of white vinegar. Place the hoses, nozzles, and brushes into this solution. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes. This helps to sanitize and deodorize them. After soaking, rinse them completely with fresh water. Make sure no vinegar smell remains. This ensures your machine parts are truly clean.

### Using Enzymatic Cleaners Against Pet Odors

Enzymatic cleaners are powerful tools against pet odors. They do more than just mask smells. These cleaners contain special enzymes. These enzymes break down the organic matter causing the odor. This includes pet urine, feces, and vomit. They are very effective for getting rid of deep-set smells.

When using an enzymatic cleaner, always check your steam cleaner's manual first. Some manufacturers do not recommend certain additives directly in the solution tank. However, you can often use these cleaners effectively in other ways. For example, you can pre-treat the carpet with an enzymatic cleaner before steam cleaning. This allows the enzymes to work on the pet stain directly. Then you can use plain water or a manufacturer-approved cleaner in your machine.

You can also use an enzymatic cleaner to clean the dirty water tank or the machine's attachments. After rinsing, apply the cleaner to the dirty tank. Let it sit for the time stated on the product label. Then scrub and rinse. This method helps to ensure the cleaner itself is free of lingering pet odors. Products like [Stainmaster Pet Carpet Cleaner are enzymatic](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-stainmaster-pet-carpet-cleaner-enzatic). Using such a cleaner helps break down the odor source instead of just covering it up. Always follow product instructions for the best results.

### Dealing with Internal Build-Up and Filters

Some parts of your steam cleaner are less visible. But they can still hold onto pet smells. These include internal hoses and filters. If you notice a persistent odor, these areas might be the problem.

Check your machine's user manual. It will show you where internal filters are located. Some machines have a small filter that collects debris. Remove and clean this filter. Rinse it thoroughly under running water. If it is clogged, you can gently scrub it. Make sure it is completely dry before putting it back.

For internal hoses, a common method is to run a cleaning solution through the machine. Fill the clean water tank with hot water and a cup of white vinegar. Run the machine as if you are cleaning a carpet, but without using it on a floor. Just spray and suction into a bucket or sink. This flushes the internal lines. Repeat with plain water to rinse. This helps clear any build-up inside the machine's pathways. This action clears away hidden pet residue.

### Preventing Future Pet Smells in Your Machine

Preventing smells is easier than removing them. I have learned that a little effort after each use saves a lot of trouble. This keeps my steam cleaner fresh and ready.

After every cleaning session, perform the immediate steps we discussed. Empty and rinse all tanks. This is the most crucial step. Do not leave dirty water in the machine. It quickly grows bacteria. Also, ensure you remove and rinse all detachable parts. This includes brush rolls, nozzles, and hoses.

Allow all components to dry completely. Do not store the machine while it is still damp. Moisture helps bacteria and mold grow. Disassemble the parts you can. Leave tanks open or slightly ajar. Place parts in a well-ventilated area. I often leave them on a towel overnight. Once everything is bone dry, put your machine back together. Store it in a cool, dry place. This simple habit keeps your steam cleaner smelling fresh for a long time.

### FAQ Section

#### Can I use bleach in my carpet steam cleaner to kill pet odor?

No, you should not use bleach in your carpet steam cleaner. Bleach can damage the internal components of your machine. It can also be dangerous if mixed with certain cleaning solutions. Bleach fumes are also strong and harmful to breathe. Stick to manufacturer-approved cleaners or natural solutions like vinegar.

#### How often should I clean my steam cleaner after cleaning pet messes?

You should clean your steam cleaner after every single use when dealing with pet messes. Emptying and rinsing tanks, hoses, and attachments immediately is key. Deep cleaning should happen regularly, perhaps every few uses, or whenever you notice a faint smell starting. This prevents odor buildup.

#### What kind of water should I use to clean my steam cleaner?

You can generally use warm tap water for rinsing and cleaning your steam cleaner. For deeper cleaning solutions, hot tap water works well with vinegar or baking soda. Some people prefer distilled water for the clean water tank to prevent mineral buildup, but it is not strictly necessary for cleaning the machine itself.

#### Can essential oils help with pet smell in the cleaner?

Essential oils may mask smells temporarily, but they do not eliminate the source of the odor. Using essential oils in your steam cleaner's tanks can also harm the machine's plastic and rubber parts. It is better to use effective cleaning agents like enzymatic cleaners or vinegar to truly remove the pet smell.

#### Is it normal for a new steam cleaner to have a strange smell?

Sometimes, a new steam cleaner might have a slight chemical or plastic smell from manufacturing. This is usually not a pet smell. This new smell often fades after the first few uses or after a thorough initial cleaning. If it persists, contact the manufacturer.

### Conclusion

Remember to empty and rinse tanks right after every use. Deep clean the dirty water tank often with vinegar or baking soda. Make sure to take apart and scrub hoses, nozzles, and brush heads.
