## Is Your KitchenAid Dishwasher Not Heating? Diagnose the Problem

A KitchenAid dishwasher should deliver hot, clean dishes. When it does not, you notice immediately. Cold water during the wash cycle leads to less effective cleaning. Dishes come out with food residue. The drying cycle also suffers without heat. You might find dishes still wet at the end. These are clear signs. A non-heating issue often points to the heating element.

The heating element is a vital component. It sits at the bottom of the tub. It warms the water to optimal temperatures for washing. It also assists in the drying process. A failing element cannot perform these tasks. This results in poor wash performance and damp dishes. Other parts can cause heating problems too. These include the thermostat or the control board. However, the heating element is a common culprit. Learning to test it yourself helps narrow down the possibilities quickly. It empowers you to tackle the repair.

You may notice other issues too. These can include a strange smell or error codes. Sometimes, a clogged filter or a dirty element can reduce efficiency. Regular maintenance helps. For instance, knowing [how to clean dishwasher heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-heating-element) can prevent some issues. However, if cleaning does not resolve the problem, testing for electrical failure is the next step. A good diagnosis avoids unnecessary part replacements. It saves you effort and money in the long run.

## Safety First: Preparing for Your KitchenAid Dishwasher Test

Before you touch any internal parts of your KitchenAid dishwasher, safety must be your top priority. Working with electrical appliances carries risks. These risks include electric shock or water damage. Always follow proper safety protocols. This protects you and your home. Do not skip any safety step. Taking these precautions ensures a smooth and safe testing process.

First, you must disconnect all power to the dishwasher. Locate your home's circuit breaker panel. Find the breaker labeled for the dishwasher. Flip it to the "OFF" position. If your breakers are not labeled, turn off the main breaker for the entire house. This ensures no power can reach the appliance. Next, turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. Look for the shut-off valve under the sink or behind the dishwasher. Turn it clockwise until it stops. This prevents water spills during the process.

Gather the right tools for the job. You will need a Phillips head screwdriver and a flathead screwdriver. A multimeter is essential for testing the heating element. Wear work gloves to protect your hands. Keep a towel handy for any residual water. Make sure your work area is dry and well-lit. Having the right tools and a prepared space makes the job easier and safer. Do not rush the preparation steps.

## Locating the Heating Element in Your KitchenAid Dishwasher

Once you have ensured safety, the next step is to find the heating element. Knowing its location is key to testing it. KitchenAid dishwashers typically have a consistent design. This makes locating the heating element straightforward. It is usually visible and accessible from inside the tub. You will not need to pull the entire appliance out from its cabinet yet.

Open the dishwasher door completely. Look down at the bottom of the wash tub. You will see a large, typically circular, metal tube. This tube is the heating element. It runs along the bottom perimeter of the tub. Sometimes, it forms a full circle. Other times, it is a U-shape. Its metallic appearance makes it stand out. It is often grey or black.

You may need to remove the lower dish rack to get a better view. Simply slide the lower rack out of the dishwasher. Some models also require removing the lower spray arm. The spray arm usually unclips or unscrews easily. Just twist or lift it according to your model's design. This gives you clear access to the heating element. The electrical terminals for the element are usually located directly underneath it. You will access these from the front or back of the dishwasher. They are typically accessed by removing the lower access panel or toe kick plate.

## Performing a Visual Inspection of the Heating Element

Before using any tools, perform a thorough visual inspection. This initial check can often reveal the problem immediately. It might save you the trouble of complex electrical tests. Look closely at the entire surface of the heating element. You are searching for any signs of physical damage or wear. These visible cues can strongly indicate a faulty part.

Examine the element for obvious cracks. A cracked element cannot heat effectively. Look for blisters or bubbles on the metal surface. These indicate overheating or internal damage. Check for discoloration. Burnt spots, charring, or excessive blackening are major red flags. This suggests that the element has shorted out or failed. Corrosion is another sign to watch for. Rust or mineral buildup can impair its function. A white, chalky residue might indicate hard water issues affecting the element.

Also, inspect the terminals where the wires connect to the heating element. Make sure they are not loose or corroded. Loose connections can prevent power from reaching the element. They can also create hot spots. If you see clear signs of damage like a visible break or a severely burnt section, the element is almost certainly bad. In such cases, further electrical testing might confirm it, but replacement is likely necessary. A visual inspection provides a quick and useful initial diagnosis.

## Using a Multimeter to Test KitchenAid Dishwasher Heating Element Continuity

Once you have visually inspected the element, it is time for the electrical test. You will use a multimeter for this. The first test is for continuity. Continuity simply means there is a continuous electrical path. Electricity can flow through the component. A heating element needs continuity to work. If the path is broken, electricity cannot flow, and no heat generates.

To begin, set your multimeter to the "ohms" (Ω) setting or the "continuity" setting. The continuity setting often has a speaker icon. It will beep if a continuous path exists. Locate the two terminals of the heating element. These are the points where the wires connect. You usually find them under the dishwasher, behind the toe kick plate. You may need to remove the wires from the terminals for an accurate reading.

Place one probe of the multimeter on each heating element terminal. If the multimeter is set to continuity, a healthy element will make a beeping sound. The display will show a reading close to zero ohms. This indicates a good electrical path. If the multimeter shows "OL" (Open Line) or "1" (infinity), and does not beep, there is no continuity. This means the heating element has an open circuit. It is broken internally. A broken heating element must be replaced. This test provides a clear "yes" or "no" answer for the element's basic function.

## Checking the Heating Element for Proper Resistance (Ohms)

After checking for continuity, the next step is to measure the heating element's resistance. Resistance is another crucial indicator of its health. It tells you how much the element opposes electrical flow. This opposition is what generates heat. A heating element must have a specific resistance value to function correctly. If the resistance is too high or too low, the element will not heat properly.

Keep your multimeter set to the "ohms" (Ω) setting. Ensure the wires are disconnected from the heating element terminals. This prevents readings from other components. Place one multimeter probe on each terminal of the heating element. The display will show a numerical value. This value is the resistance in ohms. For most KitchenAid dishwasher heating elements, the resistance should fall within a specific range. Typically, this range is between 10 and 30 ohms. However, always consult your specific dishwasher's service manual or parts diagram for the exact specification. Model variations exist.

Interpreting the reading is important. If the reading is within the specified range, the heating element likely has correct resistance. It should be capable of producing heat. If the reading is significantly outside this range (e.g., much lower than 10 ohms or much higher than 30 ohms, but not "OL"), it indicates an issue. A very low resistance might mean a short circuit, causing the element to draw too much current. A very high resistance means it draws too little current. Both situations prevent proper heating. If your resistance reading is outside the normal range, the heating element is faulty and needs replacement. If you confirm the heating element is bad, you will then need to consider how to replace it. The steps for replacement are similar for many brands, such as when you need to know [how to replace a Frigidaire dishwasher heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-frigidaire-dishwasher-heating-element).

## Troubleshooting Other Potential Causes of No Heat

If your KitchenAid dishwasher heating element tests good, the problem lies elsewhere. Several other components can prevent your dishwasher from heating. It is important to systematically check these. This ensures you accurately diagnose the issue. Do not assume the heating element is the only part that can fail.

**1. Dishwasher Thermostat (High-Limit Thermostat):** The thermostat monitors water temperature. It prevents the dishwasher from overheating. If it fails, it can cut power to the heating element. You can usually find the thermostat near the heating element or on the side of the tub. It often looks like a small, disc-shaped component with two wires. You can test a thermostat for continuity with your multimeter. Set the multimeter to continuity mode. Place one probe on each terminal of the thermostat. A good thermostat will show continuity (a beep or near-zero ohms). No continuity means it is faulty and needs replacement.

**2. Control Board:** The control board is the brain of your dishwasher. It sends power to all components, including the heating element. If the control board is faulty, it might not send the correct voltage to the element. Diagnosing a bad control board is more complex. It often requires advanced electrical testing or visual inspection for burnt components. Look for scorch marks or burnt resistors on the board. Replacing a control board is typically more expensive and might require professional help.

**3. Wiring Issues:** Loose or damaged wires can interrupt the electrical path to the heating element. After ensuring power is off, visually inspect all wires connected to the heating element, thermostat, and control board. Look for frayed wires, burnt insulation, or loose connections. Secure any loose wires. If wires are damaged, they must be replaced.

**4. User Error or Settings:** Sometimes, the problem is not a faulty part. Ensure you are using the correct wash cycle. Some cycles, like "Air Dry" or "Energy Saver," do not use the heating element for drying. Also, check that the "Heated Dry" option is selected if your model has one. Using too little or too much detergent can also affect wash performance. Ensure the [KitchenAid dishwasher does not have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) from a previous cycle, as this can affect heating. Review your owner's manual to confirm the proper settings for heated cycles.
