A Miele dishwasher typically does not drain due to clogs in the filter, drain hose, or drain pump. Other causes include a faulty drain pump, issues with the air gap or garbage disposal connection, or problems with the control board. Addressing these common areas often resolves the draining problem.

### Common Causes: Clogged Filters and Debris

A clogged filter is the most common reason why a Miele dishwasher will not drain. Food particles, grease, and other debris build up over time. This prevents water from flowing freely into the drain. Miele dishwashers have a multi-stage filter system. This system includes a coarse filter and a fine microfilter. Both filters need regular cleaning.

If these filters become blocked, water cannot pass through. The dishwasher tries to drain, but the blockage stops it. You will see standing water at the bottom of the tub. Regular cleaning prevents this common issue. I always check the filter first when I have drainage problems. This simple step often fixes the problem quickly. Neglecting filter cleaning can lead to bigger issues over time.

To check and clean the filters:

1.  **Unplug the Dishwasher:** Always disconnect power before working on the appliance. This ensures your safety.
2.  **Remove Lower Rack:** Pull out the bottom dish rack from the dishwasher tub. This provides access to the filters.
3.  **Locate Filters:** The filters are at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You will see a large cylindrical filter and a flat microfilter.
4.  **Twist and Lift:** Turn the cylindrical coarse filter counter-clockwise. Then, lift it straight up to remove it.
5.  **Remove Microfilter:** Carefully lift out the flat microfilter assembly. This may require gentle prying.
6.  **Clean Filters:** Rinse both filters under warm running water. Use a soft brush or sponge to remove any food debris. For stubborn grime, use a mild dish soap.
7.  **Inspect Housing:** Look into the filter housing area. Remove any visible debris from the sump area.
8.  **Reinstall Filters:** Place the microfilter back into position. Insert the coarse filter and turn it clockwise until it locks. Make sure it is securely in place. A loose filter can cause problems.

Properly cleaning these filters helps water flow freely. It helps your Miele dishwasher drain correctly. This simple maintenance step saves you time and money. It also keeps your dishwasher running efficiently.

### Drain Hose Obstructions and Kinks

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your home's drain system. If this hose is blocked or kinked, water cannot exit. This leads to a non-draining dishwasher. Kinks often happen during installation or when the dishwasher moves. Internal clogs can form from food particles or grease buildup over time.

A Miele dishwasher's drain hose is usually connected to a sink drain, a garbage disposal, or a dedicated drain pipe. It runs from the back of the dishwasher. I have seen many instances where a simple kink was the cause of a no-drain situation. This is an easy fix if you know what to look for. Check the entire length of the hose.

To inspect and clear the drain hose:

1.  **Disconnect Power:** Unplug your Miele dishwasher from the electrical outlet.
2.  **Access Hose:** Pull the dishwasher out slightly from its cabinet if possible. This gives you better access to the back of the unit. The drain hose usually connects to the back panel.
3.  **Inspect for Kinks:** Visually check the entire length of the drain hose. Look for any bends, twists, or sharp turns. Straighten any kinks you find.
4.  **Check for Clogs:**
    *   **At the Connection Points:** Disconnect the drain hose from the sink or garbage disposal. Look inside the hose for blockages. Use pliers to loosen the clamp.
    *   **At the Dishwasher Connection:** Disconnect the hose from the dishwasher's drain pump. Again, check for debris.
    *   **Clear the Hose:** If you suspect an internal clog, you can try flushing the hose with water. You might need to use a drain snake or a long brush. Push it through the hose to dislodge any blockages. Be gentle to avoid damaging the hose.
5.  **Reattach Hose:** Reconnect the drain hose securely at both ends. Use hose clamps to ensure a tight seal.
6.  **Test Dishwasher:** Plug the dishwasher back in. Run a short drain cycle to check if the issue is resolved.

Ensuring the drain hose is clear and properly routed is crucial. A clear hose allows water to flow freely. This helps your Miele dishwasher drain properly every time.

### Drain Pump Malfunction or Blockage

The drain pump is a critical component for removing water from your dishwasher. If the drain pump is faulty or blocked, your Miele dishwasher will not drain. The pump's motor spins an impeller, which pushes water out of the machine. Debris like broken glass, fruit pits, or silverware can get past the filter and jam the impeller.

A humming sound without water draining often indicates a blocked impeller. A completely silent pump suggests a motor failure or electrical problem. I have heard that distinct humming sound many times. It means something is stuck. This requires direct attention. Addressing pump issues early can prevent further damage.

To inspect and clear the drain pump:

1.  **Disconnect Power:** Unplug the dishwasher from the power outlet. Safety first.
2.  **Remove Filters:** Take out the coarse and fine filters as described earlier. This exposes the sump area.
3.  **Access Sump Area:** Look into the sump at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You will see the drain pump inlet. Some Miele models require removing a spray arm or other components to get a clear view.
4.  **Check for Debris:** Use a flashlight to inspect the drain pump impeller. It is usually visible through a small opening. Look for any foreign objects. Small pieces of food, glass, or plastic are common culprits.
5.  **Remove Obstructions:** Wear gloves to protect your hands. Use needle-nose pliers or tweezers to carefully remove any debris. Be very gentle. The impeller blades are delicate.
6.  **Test Impeller:** Once clear, try to spin the impeller manually. It should spin freely. If it feels stiff or does not move, the pump might be failing.
7.  **Check for Electrical Issues (Advanced):** If the impeller is clear and spins freely, the pump motor might be bad. You can test for continuity with a multimeter if you are comfortable with electrical testing. This indicates a pump failure.
8.  **Reassemble:** Put all components back in place. Reinstall the filters and racks.
9.  **Test Dishwasher:** Plug the dishwasher back in and run a drain cycle.

If the pump is clear but still does not work, it likely needs replacement. Replacing a Miele drain pump can be complex. You can find more specific instructions here: [How to Remove Miele Dishwasher Drain Pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-miele-dishwasher-drain-pump).

### Air Gap or Garbage Disposal Issues

Many Miele dishwashers connect to an air gap on the sink or directly to a garbage disposal unit. Problems with these connections can prevent proper draining. An air gap prevents dirty water from flowing back into the clean water supply. It is a small chrome cylinder on your countertop. If the air gap clogs, water can back up into the dishwasher.

A garbage disposal, if connected, must be clear. If the disposal is full of food waste, it can block the dishwasher's drain line. I have personally forgotten to clear the disposal before starting the dishwasher. This caused a messy backup. Always check these external components.

To check and clear these connections:

1.  **Air Gap:**
    *   **Remove Cover:** Unscrew or pry off the chrome cover of the air gap on your countertop.
    *   **Inspect and Clean:** Remove the plastic cap and check for any debris inside the air gap. Use a small brush or toothpick to clear any clogs. Food particles or mineral deposits can build up.
    *   **Check Hoses:** Ensure the hoses connected to the air gap are not kinked. Also, ensure they are free of clogs.
    *   **Reassemble:** Put the air gap components back together.

2.  **Garbage Disposal:**
    *   **Clear Disposal:** Turn on your garbage disposal for about 30 seconds. Run cold water while it operates. This clears any food waste.
    *   **Check Dishwasher Inlet:** Ensure the knockout plug in the garbage disposal's dishwasher inlet port is removed. This is a common oversight during new installations. If it is a new disposal, you must remove this plug before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. Use a hammer and screwdriver to knock it out.
    *   **Inspect Hose Connection:** Make sure the dishwasher drain hose is securely connected to the garbage disposal. Ensure the clamp is tight.

Checking the air gap and garbage disposal is crucial for drainage. They are external points in the drain system. Ignoring them can lead to persistent draining problems. Always ensure they are clear and functional before troubleshooting internal components.

### Faulty Drain Valve or Sensor Errors

Miele dishwashers use a drain valve to open and close the drain path. They also use sensors to monitor water levels. If the drain valve is faulty, it may not open fully or at all. This prevents water from leaving the tub. Water level sensors tell the control board how much water is present. A malfunctioning sensor might incorrectly report low water, preventing the drain cycle from activating.

A "Drain" error message on your Miele dishwasher's display often points to these issues. [Why Does My Miele Dishwasher Says Drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-miele-dishwasher-says-drain) is a good resource for understanding these error codes. These components are more complex than simple clogs. They may require a technician. However, a reset can sometimes clear a temporary sensor glitch.

To check for drain valve or sensor issues:

1.  **Check for Error Codes:** Look at the dishwasher's display. Note any error codes. Consult your Miele owner's manual for code meanings. A "Drain" error or "F11" (water intake/drainage fault) is common.
2.  **Perform a Hard Reset:**
    *   **Unplug:** Disconnect the dishwasher from power for at least 5-10 minutes.
    *   **Plug In:** Reconnect the power. This can sometimes clear temporary glitches in the control board or sensors.
3.  **Inspect Drain Valve (Advanced):** The drain valve is typically located near the drain pump. It's an electromagnetic solenoid.
    *   **Visual Check:** With the power off, visually inspect the valve. Look for obvious damage or obstructions.
    *   **Continuity Test:** Use a multimeter to test the solenoid for continuity. No continuity indicates a faulty valve. This requires electrical knowledge.
4.  **Water Level Sensor (Float Switch):**
    *   **Locate:** The float switch is usually at the bottom of the tub. It is hidden under a cover. It has a small foam or plastic float.
    *   **Check Movement:** Ensure the float moves freely up and down. If it is stuck, clean around it. Debris can prevent it from dropping to the "empty" position.
    *   **Test Switch:** Test the switch for continuity in both the up and down positions. A faulty switch needs replacement.

If the problem persists after these checks, it likely points to a part failure. Replacing a drain valve or water level sensor requires dismantling parts of the dishwasher. I recommend consulting a Miele service manual or calling a qualified technician for these repairs.

### Power Supply or Control Board Malfunctions

While less common for draining issues, electrical problems can sometimes cause a Miele dishwasher not to drain. The drain pump needs power to operate. If the power supply to the pump is interrupted, it will not run. This can be due to a tripped circuit breaker, a loose wire, or a faulty control board. The control board acts as the brain of the dishwasher. It sends commands to all components, including the drain pump.

A control board malfunction can prevent the drain cycle from initiating. It can also send incorrect signals to the pump. This makes the pump fail to activate. Sometimes, these issues can appear intermittently. They are harder to diagnose than a simple clog. I have seen situations where a quick check of the circuit breaker solved a seemingly complex problem.

To troubleshoot power supply and control board issues:

1.  **Check Circuit Breaker:**
    *   **Locate Panel:** Find your home's main electrical panel.
    *   **Reset Breaker:** Locate the circuit breaker for the kitchen or dishwasher. It may be labeled. If it is tripped (usually in the middle position), switch it completely off. Then switch it back to the 'On' position.
    *   **Test Outlet:** Plug a small appliance, like a lamp, into the dishwasher's outlet. Ensure the outlet provides power.
2.  **Inspect Power Cord and Outlet:**
    *   **Visual Check:** Ensure the dishwasher's power cord is fully plugged into the wall outlet.
    *   **Damage:** Look for any visible damage to the cord.
3.  **Control Board (Expert Level):**
    *   **Reset:** As mentioned before, a hard reset (unplugging for 5-10 minutes) can sometimes reset the control board.
    *   **Visual Inspection:** If you are comfortable, you can access the control board (usually behind the kick plate or control panel). Look for signs of burning, scorch marks, or damaged components. *Caution: Do this only if you are familiar with electrical components and safety.*
    *   **Professional Help:** If the circuit breaker is fine and there's no visible cord damage, a control board issue is likely. This repair is best left to a qualified Miele technician. Replacing a control board is costly and complex.

Electrical issues can be tricky. They often require specialized tools and knowledge. Always prioritize your safety when dealing with electricity. If you are uncertain, it is always best to call a professional.
