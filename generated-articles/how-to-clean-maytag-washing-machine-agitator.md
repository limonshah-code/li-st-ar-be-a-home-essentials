## How To Clean Your Maytag Washing Machine Agitator

Do you notice a lingering smell in your laundry even after a wash cycle? Your Maytag washing machine's agitator might be the culprit. Over time, lint, soap scum, and hard water minerals build up inside this central component. This residue creates a perfect environment for mold and mildew to thrive. A dirty agitator can transfer grime back onto your clothes. It also affects how well your machine cleans. I know the feeling of opening the washer door to a stale odor. Cleaning the agitator is a simple task that makes a big difference. This guide will walk you through the steps. We will cover why cleaning is important and what tools you need. I will show you how to safely remove the agitator. Then we will deep clean it. Finally, I will explain how to put it back together and keep it clean.

### Takeaway

*   **Remove Power:** Always unplug your Maytag washer before starting any cleaning.
*   **Gather Tools:** You will need basic tools like screwdrivers and cleaning supplies.
*   **Unscrew and Lift:** Carefully remove the agitator cap and retaining bolt. Lift the agitator straight up.
*   **Deep Clean:** Use a brush and cleaning solution to scrub away all grime from the agitator and the tub area.
*   **Reassemble:** Put the agitator back, secure the bolt, and reconnect power.
*   **Prevent Future Buildup:** Use proper detergent, avoid overloading, and leave the lid open after washes.

To clean a Maytag washing machine agitator, unplug the unit for safety. Remove the agitator's fabric softener dispenser cap and inner bolt. Lift the agitator straight up and out. Scrub all parts thoroughly with a brush and a mixture of vinegar or bleach. Rinse, dry, and reassemble the components. This process removes built-up grime and odors.

## Why Your Maytag Agitator Needs Regular Cleaning

Your Maytag washing machine works hard. It cleans your clothes day after day. But as it cleans, it can collect dirt itself. The agitator is the tall column in the middle of a top-load washer. It moves clothes through the water. Over time, various substances get trapped inside and around it. These include detergent residue, fabric softener, lint, and hard water minerals.

This buildup is not just unsightly. It creates a breeding ground for mold and mildew. You might notice a musty smell coming from your washing machine. This smell often transfers to your freshly washed clothes. I have experienced this many times. It is frustrating to have clothes come out smelling worse than they went in. A dirty agitator also makes your washer less efficient. The grime can interfere with the washing action. This means your clothes do not get as clean as they should. Regular cleaning solves these problems. It keeps your laundry smelling fresh. It also extends the life of your appliance. I always feel better knowing my machine is truly clean.

## Gathering Your Tools and Supplies for Agitator Cleaning

Before you start cleaning, gather everything you need. Having all your tools ready makes the process smoother. You do not want to stop midway to find a forgotten item. I always lay out my supplies beforehand. This ensures a quick and efficient job. Proper tools protect both you and your Maytag washing machine.

Here is a list of items you will need:

*   **Safety Gloves:** Protect your hands from cleaning solutions.
*   **Safety Glasses:** Protect your eyes from splashes or debris.
*   **Flathead Screwdriver:** Needed to pry off the agitator cap.
*   **Socket Wrench or Nut Driver:** Essential for unscrewing the agitator bolt. The size often varies, but a common size is 7/16 inch or 1/2 inch. Check your Maytag manual if unsure.
*   **Soft Brushes:** A small brush, like a toothbrush, helps clean tight spaces. A larger scrub brush works for bigger surfaces.
*   **Old Towels or Rags:** For wiping surfaces and soaking up water.
*   **Bucket or Basin:** To hold the removed agitator parts.
*   **Cleaning Solutions:**
    *   **White Vinegar:** A natural disinfectant and odor remover. Mix with water.
    *   **Baking Soda:** Great for scrubbing and deodorizing. Make a paste with water.
    *   **Dish Soap:** For cutting through greasy residue.
    *   **Bleach (Optional, use with caution):** If mold is severe. Always dilute and use in a well-ventilated area. Never mix bleach with vinegar.
*   **Flashlight:** To see into dark areas of the tub.

Having these items ready helps you tackle the job without interruptions. It also ensures you clean effectively. My cleaning routine always starts with gathering these basics.

## Step-by-Step: Removing the Maytag Washing Machine Agitator

Removing the agitator is the first critical step in deep cleaning. This process needs careful attention. My goal is to do this safely and without damaging any parts. Remember to prioritize your safety above all else. I always double-check these steps myself.

Here is how to remove your Maytag washing machine agitator:

1.  **Disconnect Power:** This is the most important safety step. Unplug your Maytag washing machine from the wall outlet. Do not skip this. Water and electricity are a dangerous combination. Make sure the machine is completely off.
2.  **Empty the Tub:** Ensure the washing machine tub is empty. Remove any lingering laundry. Make sure there is no standing water. If water remains, run a drain cycle. You might also need to know [how to drain your Maytag washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-my-maytag-washing-machine) if it is stuck.
3.  **Locate the Agitator Cap:** The agitator typically has a cap on top. This cap often doubles as a fabric softener dispenser. It might look like a simple plastic cover. Some Maytag models have a cap that twists off. Others might just pull straight up.
4.  **Remove the Agitator Cap:**
    *   **Twist-Off Caps:** Grip the cap firmly and twist counter-clockwise. It should unthread and lift away.
    *   **Pull-Off Caps:** Use a flathead screwdriver or your fingers to gently pry up the edges. Work your way around until the cap pops off. Be gentle. You do not want to crack the plastic.
5.  **Find the Retaining Bolt:** Once the cap is off, you will see a bolt inside the agitator shaft. This bolt holds the agitator in place. This is usually a large nut. It secures the agitator to the drive shaft.
6.  **Unscrew the Retaining Bolt:** Use your socket wrench or nut driver. Fit it over the bolt and turn it counter-clockwise. The bolt might be tight. Apply steady pressure. Be careful not to strip the bolt head. Set the bolt aside in a safe place. I use a small container for all screws and bolts. This prevents losing small parts.
7.  **Lift the Agitator:** Now the agitator is free. Grip the agitator firmly with both hands. Wiggle it gently from side to side. Pull it straight up. Some agitators have a lower section that separates. If so, lift the top part first. Then lift the bottom part. It might be stuck due to soap scum or rust. If it is stuck, try pouring warm water around the base. Let it sit for a few minutes. This can loosen the grime. Then try lifting again. You can also learn more about [how to clean an agitator in a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-agitator-in-washing-machine) in general terms, which often includes agitator removal.

With the agitator removed, you can now access all its hidden areas. You also have a clear view of the washer tub bottom. This area collects a lot of gunk.

## Deep Cleaning Your Maytag Agitator Components

Once you remove the agitator, you will likely find hidden grime. This is where the real cleaning happens. I always get surprised by how much dirt accumulates in these unseen spots. Now is the time to give your Maytag agitator a thorough cleaning.

Here is how to deep clean each component:

### Cleaning the Agitator Itself

The agitator assembly is usually made of two main parts: the upper agitator and the wash plate (sometimes called the lower agitator).

1.  **Separate Agitator Parts (if applicable):** Some Maytag agitators come apart into two or more sections. Look for clips or screws that hold them together. If they separate, do so. This allows you to clean all surfaces.
2.  **Initial Rinse:** Take the agitator parts to a utility sink or bathtub. Rinse them with warm water. This removes loose lint and debris.
3.  **Scrub with Cleaning Solution:**
    *   **Vinegar and Baking Soda:** Make a paste with baking soda and a little water. Apply it to the entire agitator. Use a soft brush (like an old toothbrush) to scrub all crevices. Pay attention to the underside and any grooves. For tough spots, spray with undiluted white vinegar. The fizzing action helps loosen grime. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes.
    *   **Dish Soap:** For greasy residue, use a few drops of dish soap. Mix it with warm water. Scrub vigorously with your brush.
    *   **Bleach (for severe mold):** If you see heavy black mold, a diluted bleach solution can help. Mix 1 part bleach with 10 parts water. Apply it to the moldy areas. Let it sit for a few minutes. Scrub well. **Crucially, never mix bleach with vinegar or any other cleaner. Ensure the area is well-ventilated.** Rinse thoroughly afterwards. You can learn more about [how to clean a Maytag washing machine with bleach](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-maytag-washing-machine-with-bleach) for general washer cleaning.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** After scrubbing, rinse all agitator parts completely. Make sure no cleaning solution residue remains. You want to see clean, shiny plastic.
5.  **Dry:** Use a clean towel to dry the agitator parts. Ensure they are completely dry before reinstallation. This prevents new mold growth.

### Cleaning the Washer Tub Underneath the Agitator

Do not forget the area under where the agitator sits. This spot is often neglected. It accumulates a lot of grime.

1.  **Inspect the Tub:** Use your flashlight to look inside the washing machine tub. Pay attention to the bottom plate and sides. You will likely see dark spots or rings of residue.
2.  **Remove Debris:** Carefully pick out any large pieces of lint, hair, or debris. A shop vacuum can also help here.
3.  **Spray and Scrub:** Spray the entire exposed tub area with white vinegar or your preferred cleaning solution. Let it soak for 10-15 minutes. Use a scrub brush to clean the tub's bottom and sides. Really get into the crevices and around the drain holes.
4.  **Wipe Down:** Use clean rags to wipe away all the loosened grime and cleaning solution. You might need to rinse the rags often. Continue wiping until the tub looks spotless.
5.  **Run a Clean Cycle:** Once the agitator is reinstalled, I recommend running a hot water cycle. Add a cup of white vinegar or a washer cleaning tablet to the empty tub. This helps rinse away any remaining residue. It also flushes the drain system. This is an important part of ensuring [how to clean your Maytag washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-maytag-washing-machine-filter) which can also affect overall machine cleanliness.

By thoroughly cleaning both the agitator and the tub area, you ensure maximum cleanliness. Your clothes will come out fresher than ever. This deep cleaning process makes a noticeable difference.

## Reinstalling Your Maytag Washing Machine Agitator

After all that scrubbing and rinsing, it is time to put your Maytag agitator back together. Reinstallation is generally straightforward. Just reverse the removal steps. I always take a moment to ensure every part is dry and in its correct place. This prevents future issues.

Follow these steps for proper reinstallation:

1.  **Position the Agitator Base:** If your agitator has a separate lower wash plate or base, place this part first. Make sure it aligns correctly with the drive shaft. It should sit flat on the bottom of the tub.
2.  **Place the Upper Agitator:** Carefully lower the main agitator body onto the drive shaft. Ensure it slides down smoothly. It should fit snugly over the shaft. You might need to twist it slightly. It will usually "key" into place. This means a specific notch on the agitator aligns with a groove on the shaft.
3.  **Reinsert the Retaining Bolt:** Once the agitator is fully seated, reinsert the bolt into the shaft. This is the bolt you removed earlier. Make sure it threads properly.
4.  **Tighten the Bolt:** Use your socket wrench or nut driver to tighten the bolt. Turn it clockwise until it is snug. Do not overtighten it. Overtightening can strip the threads or damage the agitator. It should be firm but not excessively tight. You want the agitator to stay in place during cycles.
5.  **Replace the Agitator Cap:** Place the agitator cap back on top. If it is a twist-on cap, turn it clockwise until it locks. If it is a push-on cap, press it down firmly until it clicks into place. Make sure it sits securely.
6.  **Reconnect Power:** Plug your Maytag washing machine back into the wall outlet.
7.  **Test Run:** Run a short, empty cycle with hot water. This helps flush any remaining cleaning solution. It also confirms the agitator is working correctly. Listen for unusual noises. Check for any wobbling. This test run ensures everything is in working order.

You have now successfully deep cleaned and reinstalled your Maytag washing machine agitator. This simple maintenance task makes a big difference in your laundry's freshness. I feel a sense of accomplishment after completing this job.

## Maintaining Your Maytag Agitator for Long-Term Cleanliness

Cleaning your Maytag washing machine agitator is a great start. But ongoing maintenance is key to keeping it clean. You want to prevent mold and odors from returning. I have developed a few habits that keep my washer fresh between deep cleans. These simple practices go a long way.

Here are tips for long-term agitator cleanliness:

*   **Regular Cleaning Cycles:** Run an empty hot water cycle every month. Add a cup of white vinegar or a dedicated washing machine cleaner. This flushes out residue. It also disinfects the tub and agitator. This is similar to [how to clean a Maytag washing machine front loader](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-maytag-washing-machine-front-loader), which also benefits from regular cleaning cycles.
*   **Use the Right Detergent Amount:** Too much detergent creates excessive suds. These suds leave behind sticky residue. This residue traps dirt and feeds mold. Follow the detergent manufacturer's recommendations. Use high-efficiency (HE) detergent if your Maytag machine is HE.
*   **Do Not Overload the Washer:** Overloading restricts water flow. It prevents proper rinsing of clothes and the machine itself. This leaves more dirt and detergent behind. Give clothes enough room to move freely.
*   **Leave the Lid Open:** After each wash cycle, leave the washing machine lid ajar. This allows air to circulate inside the tub. It helps the interior dry out. A dry environment discourages mold and mildew growth. I do this after every load.
*   **Wipe Down the Drum and Agitator:** After your last load of the day, quickly wipe down the inside of the washer. Pay attention to the top of the agitator and the rim of the tub. Use a clean, dry cloth. This removes moisture and any visible residue.
*   **Check and Clean Detergent Dispensers:** Residue can build up in the detergent and fabric softener dispensers. Clean these regularly. Follow your Maytag manual for how to remove and clean these parts. This prevents clogs and odors.
*   **Address Hard Water Issues:** If you have hard water, mineral deposits can build up quickly. Consider using a water softener additive with your laundry. You can also run a monthly cleaning cycle with a descaling agent.
*   **Inspect Agitator Periodically:** Every few months, quickly check under the agitator cap. Look for any signs of new buildup. This allows you to catch issues early. A quick wipe down might be all you need.

By following these maintenance tips, you will keep your Maytag agitator clean. This ensures your clothes come out fresh. It also helps your washing machine perform at its best. I have found these habits save me time and effort in the long run.

## Troubleshooting Common Maytag Agitator Cleaning Issues

Even with the best intentions, you might face challenges when cleaning your Maytag agitator. Some problems are more common than others. Knowing how to troubleshoot these can save you frustration. I have encountered a few of these issues myself. Here are some solutions to common problems.

### Problem: Agitator is Stuck and Won't Lift

This is a frequent issue. Grime and mineral deposits can create a strong bond.

*   **Apply Warm Water:** Pour hot water directly around the base of the agitator. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. The warm water helps dissolve soap scum and loosen mineral deposits.
*   **Gentle Wiggling:** After soaking, try wiggling the agitator vigorously from side to side. Apply steady upward pressure. Do not force it or yank it hard. This can damage the drive shaft.
*   **Use a Strap Wrench (Carefully):** If still stuck, a strap wrench can provide extra grip. Wrap it around the agitator base. Apply even upward pressure while wiggling. Be very careful not to dent or crack the plastic.
*   **Consider a Specialty Puller:** For extremely stubborn agitators, a washing machine agitator puller tool exists. These are specific tools designed to lift stuck agitators. You can often rent these or buy them from appliance parts stores.

### Problem: Agitator Bolt is Stripped or Stuck

This bolt can be very tight. It might get corroded over time.

*   **Penetrating Oil:** Spray a small amount of penetrating oil (like WD-40) onto the bolt. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or even a few hours. This can help loosen rust.
*   **Correct Socket Size:** Ensure you are using the exact correct size socket wrench. An ill-fitting socket can strip the bolt head further.
*   **Apply Steady Pressure:** Use slow, steady force. Avoid sudden jerks. You might need an extension bar for better leverage.
*   **Drilling Out (Last Resort):** If the bolt is completely stripped and won't budge, you might need to drill it out. This is a complex task. It often requires a professional appliance repair technician. I would only attempt this if I had experience with similar repairs.

### Problem: Persistent Musty Odor After Cleaning

You cleaned everything, but the smell lingers.

*   **Check Drain Hose:** The drain hose can harbor mold and mildew. Detach it from the standpipe and inspect it. Clean it with a long brush and bleach solution.
*   **Clean the Washer Filter:** Many Maytag models have a pump filter. This filter traps lint and debris. A clogged filter causes odors. Refer to your Maytag manual for its location. Learn [how to clean your Maytag washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-maytag-washing-machine-filter) for a comprehensive guide.
*   **Run Multiple Hot Cycles:** Run several empty hot water cycles with vinegar or a commercial washer cleaner.
*   **Inspect Under the Tub Seal:** For some models, especially if there's a rubber gasket, check under it for mold.
*   **Ventilation:** Always leave the lid open after washes to air dry the tub.

Addressing these common issues ensures your Maytag washing machine remains clean and fresh. Do not get discouraged if you hit a snag. Often, a bit of patience and the right approach will solve the problem.
