#### **Common Area Rug Materials and Their Needs**

*   **Wool Rugs:** Wool is a natural fiber, soft, and durable. It naturally resists dirt and stains due to its lanolin content. However, wool can shrink or fade with harsh chemicals and hot water. Use gentle, pH-neutral cleaners specifically designed for wool. Always check for colorfastness.
*   **Synthetic Rugs (Nylon, Polypropylene, Polyester):** These rugs are very popular. They are durable, stain-resistant, and generally easy to clean. You can often use stronger cleaning solutions on synthetic fibers without harm. They dry faster than natural fibers.

*   **Silk Rugs:** Silk rugs are luxurious and expensive. They are also very delicate. Silk fibers can be damaged by water, which can cause colors to run or fibers to lose
