Art Van Furniture, a prominent Michigan-based retailer, did historically carry a selection of area rugs that often included various styles referred to as Oriental rugs.

Consumers now need to seek out other specialized retailers or online platforms for these unique pieces.

## Art Van Furniture: A Legacy and Its Evolution

Art Van Furniture was a major player in the home furnishings industry for decades. It started as a single store in Detroit in 1959. The company grew rapidly, becoming a beloved brand across the Midwest. Many families relied on Art Van for their furniture needs. I remember my parents often discussing their latest sales.

Art Van built a reputation for offering a wide range of products. They sold everything from living room sets to bedroom furniture. Customers could find mattresses, dining tables, and decorative accessories. This broad selection made Art Van a convenient one-stop shop for home decor. They aimed to provide quality and style for every budget.

### The Rise and Fall of a Retail Giant

Art Van Furniture experienced significant growth during its prime years. It expanded into numerous states, opening large, impressive showrooms. These stores were designed to inspire customers with beautifully staged room displays. The company was known for its aggressive advertising campaigns. Many people in the region recognized their jingles and slogans.

Despite its success, Art Van faced increasing competition and changing market conditions. The retail landscape shifted dramatically in the late 2010s. Online shopping grew, and consumer preferences evolved. These factors put pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar stores. The company eventually struggled to adapt to these new challenges.

### What Happened to Art Van?

In March 2020, Art Van Furniture announced its liquidation and closure of all its stores. This news shocked many loyal customers and employees. The company cited financial difficulties and the impact of the ongoing pandemic as reasons for its decision. All inventory was sold off in going-out-of-business sales. It marked the end of an era for a prominent regional retailer.

While the original Art Van Furniture brand no longer exists, some former stores briefly operated under new ownership or different names. However, the comprehensive network of Art Van stores as people knew it is gone. This situation means finding products directly from "Art Van" is not possible anymore. Its legacy reminds us of how quickly retail environments can change.

## Did Art Van Historically Stock Oriental Rugs?

Yes, Art Van Furniture historically did stock and sell area rugs that often included styles considered Oriental. As a large home furnishings store, they aimed to offer a complete range of decor items. Rugs were an essential part of their product mix. Customers could typically find various designs and sizes suitable for different rooms.

The store's rug department featured different types of rugs. They carried machine-made rugs, hand-tufted options, and sometimes hand-knotted pieces. Among these, you would often see patterns and motifs inspired by traditional Oriental designs. These rugs were popular choices for adding warmth and character to homes. I recall seeing many such rugs on display.

### Exploring Art Van's Past Rug Collections

Art Van's rug collections varied over time and by store location. However, they generally included a good selection of area rugs. These rugs featured diverse colors, patterns, and materials. You might have found rugs with intricate floral designs or geometric motifs. These styles are characteristic of what people often associate with Oriental rugs.

The store aimed to cater to different tastes and budgets. Some rugs were affordable, designed for everyday use. Others were more premium, offering higher quality materials and craftsmanship. Shoppers appreciated having choices when furnishing their homes. Their rug selection was part of this overall strategy to meet diverse customer needs.

This approach allows them to serve both budget-conscious buyers and those seeking higher-end items.

The market offers a wide variety of options, from online stores to specialized boutiques. You can find rugs that suit any decor style or budget.

This will help you narrow down your choices effectively. It is always a good idea to compare options before making a purchase.

Specialty rug dealers are often the best place to find authentic Oriental rugs. These stores focus exclusively on rugs, offering extensive selections. Their staff typically has deep knowledge about different rug types, origins, and materials. They can guide you through the intricacies of hand-knotted rugs. I find their expertise invaluable when making a significant purchase.

These dealers often source their rugs directly from weaving regions. This ensures authenticity and can offer better value. You can find Persian, Turkish, Caucasian, and other types of Oriental rugs here. Many specialty stores also provide cleaning and repair services. This added service is helpful for maintaining your rug's longevity. To truly understand what makes a good purchase, you should read about [how to find good Oriental rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-good-oriental-rugs). This helps you identify quality and value.

### Online Retailers and Marketplaces

The internet offers a vast array of Oriental rugs from various sellers. Large online retailers, dedicated rug websites, and auction sites are popular options. You can browse thousands of rugs from the comfort of your home. This provides unparalleled convenience and selection. Be sure to check seller reputations and return policies.

When buying online, clear photos, detailed descriptions, and customer reviews are essential. Some reputable online dealers specialize in Oriental rugs. They offer virtual consultations and even rug samples. It is crucial to verify the authenticity claims of any online seller. Look for sites that offer certifications or guarantees for their products.

### Department Stores and Home Decor Chains

Many large department stores and home decor chains still carry area rugs. Their selections may include Oriental-style rugs. These are often machine-made or hand-tufted rugs that mimic traditional designs. They can be a good option if you seek the aesthetic without the investment of a hand-knotted piece. However, true hand-knotted Oriental rugs are less common here.

While they might not have the expertise of a specialty dealer, they offer accessible options. It's a great starting point for those new to rug shopping.

## Understanding Oriental Rugs: A Buyer's Guide

Oriental rugs are more than just floor coverings; they are works of art. These rugs boast a rich history, unique craftsmanship, and diverse cultural significance. Knowing what defines an Oriental rug helps you make an informed purchase. It empowers you to appreciate their beauty and value. I always feel a connection to the past when I look at a well-made Oriental rug.

These rugs come from various countries across Asia. Each region has its own distinctive patterns, colors, and weaving techniques. Understanding these differences can enhance your appreciation. It also helps you identify what kind of rug best suits your personal style and home decor. This knowledge is key to becoming a savvy rug buyer.

### What Defines an Oriental Rug?

An Oriental rug is traditionally a hand-knotted pile rug from Asia. Countries such as Iran (Persia), Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, and Nepal are well-known producers. The term "Oriental rug" broadly encompasses rugs from this vast geographic region. "Persian rug" is a specific type of Oriental rug, originating from Iran. All Persian rugs are Oriental rugs, but not all Oriental rugs are Persian.

Key characteristics include natural fibers, intricate patterns, and a hand-knotted construction. The knots are tied by hand onto a warp and weft foundation. This creates a dense, durable pile. These rugs often feature vegetable dyes for rich, lasting colors. The artistry and time involved in their creation make each rug unique.

### Key Characteristics to Look For

When examining an Oriental rug, several features indicate its quality and authenticity. First, check the knot density on the back of the rug. A higher knot count per square inch generally indicates finer craftsmanship and durability. Second, inspect the materials. Most authentic Oriental rugs use wool for the pile. Wool is naturally durable, stain-resistant, and retains color well. Some might use silk, which is incredibly soft and lustrous but less durable for high-traffic areas. Consider [what material are Oriental rugs made of](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-material-are-oriental-rugs-made-of) to understand these differences better.

Third, look at the dyes. Traditional rugs use natural vegetable dyes, which create subtle color variations. Machine-made rugs often use synthetic dyes, resulting in more uniform colors. Finally, examine the fringe. On hand-knotted rugs, the fringe is an extension of the rug's warp threads. It is not sewn on separately. This detail is a tell-tale sign of authentic construction. These characteristics help you identify a genuine, well-made piece.

## Investing in an Oriental Rug: Cost, Care, and Longevity

An Oriental rug can be a significant investment for your home. These pieces are not just decorative items; they are often considered heirlooms. Understanding the factors that influence their cost is important. Knowing how to properly care for them ensures their beauty and value endure for generations. My own experience has shown me that good care makes a huge difference.

The longevity of an Oriental rug is one of its most appealing qualities. With proper maintenance, these rugs can last for decades, even centuries. This makes them a sustainable choice for home decor. They offer both aesthetic appeal and practical durability. It truly is an investment that pays dividends in beauty and heritage.

### Factors Influencing Oriental Rug Costs

The cost of an Oriental rug varies widely based on several factors. One primary factor is the rug's origin. Persian rugs, for instance, are often among the most expensive due to their renowned craftsmanship and historical significance. The material also plays a huge role. Silk rugs are generally more costly than wool rugs because silk is a luxurious fiber. The age and condition of the rug also impact price. Antique rugs, if well-preserved, can fetch very high prices.

Another critical factor is knot density. A higher number of knots per square inch means more labor and finer detail, increasing the value. The complexity of the design and the use of natural dyes also contribute to the price. Larger rugs naturally cost more than smaller ones. Finally, the reputation of the seller can affect pricing. A specialized dealer might price rugs higher due to their expertise and guaranteed authenticity.

### Essential Care for Your Investment

Proper care is essential to preserve the beauty and value of your Oriental rug. Regular vacuuming helps remove dirt and grit that can damage fibers. Be sure to use a vacuum with adjustable height settings to avoid damaging the fringe. I always vacuum in the direction of the pile to protect the fibers. Rotating your rug periodically prevents uneven wear and fading from sunlight.

For spills, act quickly. Blot the spill with a clean cloth; do not rub. For deeper cleaning, professional services are highly recommended. Specialized rug cleaners know how to handle delicate fibers and dyes. They use appropriate methods that protect the rug's integrity. For specific insights into professional cleaning expenses, check [how much does it cost to clean Oriental rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-clean-oriental-rugs). This information helps you budget for their ongoing care. Regularly cleaning helps maintain the rug's original appearance. For comprehensive guidance on daily and long-term care, exploring [how to maintain Oriental rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-maintain-oriental-rugs) provides valuable tips.

## Matching Oriental Rugs with Your Home Decor

Oriental rugs are incredibly versatile. They can complement a wide range of interior design styles, not just traditional ones. Integrating these rugs into your home decor can add warmth, texture, and a touch of global elegance. The key is to think about balance and harmony. I love how a single rug can transform a whole room.

Choosing the right Oriental rug involves considering its colors, patterns, and size. You want the rug to enhance your existing furniture and artwork. It should feel like a natural part of the room, not an afterthought. With a little planning, you can make your Oriental rug a stunning focal point.

### Blending Traditional and Modern

Many people believe Oriental rugs only fit traditional, ornate settings. This is a misconception. These rugs can look fantastic in modern or minimalist spaces. Their intricate patterns and rich colors offer a striking contrast to sleek furniture. This juxtaposition creates visual interest and depth. For example, a vintage Persian rug can ground a contemporary living room.

To blend traditional rugs with modern decor, consider the rug's dominant colors. Choose a rug with colors that tie into your existing color scheme. Also, think about scale. A large, bold pattern might dominate a small room. A more subtle design or a smaller rug might work better. You can also explore [how to match Oriental rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-match-oriental-rugs) for more detailed styling advice. This guidance helps you create a cohesive and stylish look. Furthermore, if you are planning to use more than one, learning [how to mix Oriental rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-mix-oriental-rugs) effectively can elevate your interior design.

### Size and Placement Considerations

The size of your Oriental rug is crucial for its impact on a room. In a living room, the rug should be large enough for at least the front legs of all major furniture pieces to rest on it. This creates a cohesive seating area. A smaller rug floating in the middle of a room can make the space feel disjointed. In a dining room, the rug should extend far enough that chairs remain on the rug even when pulled out.

For bedrooms, consider placing a large rug under the bed. It should extend several feet on either side for softness underfoot. Runners are perfect for hallways, adding warmth and sound absorption. Always measure your space carefully before purchasing. This ensures the rug fits perfectly and enhances the room's proportions. Sometimes, even old rugs can be given a new lease on life with creative placement, so consider how [how to update Oriental rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-update-oriental-rugs) can help you rethink your current pieces.

## The Appeal of Used and Vintage Oriental Rugs

Beyond new rugs, the market for used and vintage Oriental rugs is vibrant. These pre-owned pieces offer unique charm and character that new rugs often lack. They come with a history, a story that adds depth to any room. Buying used rugs can also be a more sustainable choice. It gives beautiful pieces a second life. I find a certain allure in a rug that has already lived a little.

Exploring vintage markets, antique shops, and online platforms opens up a world of possibilities. You might discover a one-of-a-kind treasure at a fraction of the cost of a new rug. However, it is essential to know what to look for when buying used. Condition, authenticity, and potential repairs are key considerations.

### Charm and Character of Vintage Rugs

Vintage Oriental rugs often possess a rich patina that develops over years of use. This soft, aged appearance is highly sought after by designers and homeowners alike. The colors may have subtly mellowed, and the wool can feel incredibly soft. Each imperfection, like slight wear or a faded area, tells a part of the rug's journey. These elements contribute to its unique character.

Many vintage rugs also represent weaving styles or dye techniques that are no longer common. They offer a glimpse into textile art from a specific period or region. Owning such a rug is like owning a piece of history. It adds an unparalleled sense of authenticity and warmth to your living space. This historical element makes them particularly special.

### Where to Discover Used Treasures

There are several excellent avenues for finding used Oriental rugs. Antique stores and specialized vintage rug dealers are prime locations. These sellers often curate high-quality, authentic pieces. They can provide information about the rug's age and origin. Reputable dealers will also disclose any repairs or condition issues. I prefer to see these rugs in person when possible.

Online marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, or specialized rug auction sites also offer a wide selection. Be cautious when buying online. Always request detailed photos and descriptions. Check seller reviews and return policies carefully. Estate sales, flea markets, and consignment shops can also yield incredible finds. These places sometimes offer rugs at very competitive prices. For more guidance on pricing and what to expect, learning [how much are used Oriental rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-are-used-oriental-rugs) can be very helpful. This knowledge prepares you for the varied market.
