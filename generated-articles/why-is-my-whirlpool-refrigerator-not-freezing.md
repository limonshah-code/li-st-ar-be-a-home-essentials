### My Whirlpool refrigerator is not freezing due to issues like excessive frost on evaporator coils, dirty condenser coils, or a faulty fan motor. Other causes include door seal leaks, incorrect temperature settings, or more serious problems with the sealed system components.

### Understanding Your Whirlpool Refrigerator's Cooling System

Your Whirlpool refrigerator uses a simple but effective system to keep food cold. A compressor starts the process. It compresses a refrigerant gas. This action raises the gas's temperature and pressure.

The high-pressure gas then flows to the condenser coils. These coils are usually on the back or bottom of the refrigerator. Here, the hot gas releases heat to the surrounding air. The gas cools down and condenses into a high-pressure liquid. This liquid then moves through a capillary tube or expansion valve. This reduces its pressure.

The low-pressure liquid then enters the evaporator coils. These coils are inside the freezer compartment. Here, the liquid refrigerant absorbs heat from the air inside the freezer. This causes the liquid to turn back into a low-pressure gas. This process makes the freezer cold. The gas then returns to the compressor, and the cycle repeats. Proper function of each part is vital for efficient freezing.

### Common Reasons for a Whirlpool Refrigerator Not Freezing

Many factors can cause your Whirlpool refrigerator to stop freezing. Sometimes, the problem is simple. Other times, it requires a more in-depth look. We will start with basic checks before moving to complex issues.

First, always check the temperature settings. Someone might have accidentally changed them. Ensure the freezer is set to 0°F (-18°C) and the fresh food section to 37°F (3°C). A power interruption can also sometimes reset settings. Check if the refrigerator is plugged in firmly. Also, ensure the circuit breaker is not tripped. These simple checks often resolve the issue quickly.

Next, consider the refrigerator's location and load. Placing the refrigerator too close to a wall blocks airflow. This makes the unit work harder. Overloading the freezer with too much food can also restrict air circulation. Proper air circulation inside the freezer is crucial for freezing. If your refrigerator is not cooling or freezing, it might be due to a combination of these factors. Addressing these basic elements can often restore freezing performance.

### Evaporator Coils: Frost Buildup and Defrost Issues

One of the most common reasons a Whirlpool refrigerator stops freezing is excessive frost buildup on the evaporator coils. These coils are responsible for absorbing heat from the freezer. If they become covered in a thick layer of ice, they cannot perform their job. This leads to poor freezing performance.

The refrigerator has a defrost system designed to prevent this buildup. This system typically includes a defrost heater, a defrost thermostat, and a defrost timer or main control board. If any of these components fail, the defrost cycle will not run. This allows ice to accumulate rapidly on the evaporator coils. You might hear the fan running, but no cold air moves.

You can often see the frost buildup by removing the back panel inside your freezer. If you see a solid block of ice, you have found a major issue. A temporary fix involves unplugging the refrigerator for 24-48 hours. This allows the ice to melt completely. However, if the defrost system components are truly faulty, the ice will return. You will need to replace the specific faulty part.

### Condenser Coils and Fan: Overheating Problems

The condenser coils play a vital role in removing heat from the refrigerant. These coils are usually located on the back or underneath your Whirlpool refrigerator. Over time, dust, pet hair, and debris can accumulate on them. This creates an insulating layer.

When condenser coils are dirty, they cannot efficiently dissipate heat. This causes the refrigerator's compressor to work harder. The system overheats. An overheated compressor struggles to properly circulate refrigerant. This leads to a noticeable decrease in freezing capability. Regularly cleaning these coils is a simple maintenance task that prevents many issues. You can use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove the grime.

The condenser fan works with the coils. This fan pulls air over the condenser coils to help cool the refrigerant. If the condenser fan motor is faulty or obstructed, the coils will not cool down enough. This also leads to an overheated system and poor freezing performance. You might hear unusual noises from the back of the refrigerator, or no fan noise at all. Checking for obstructions and ensuring the fan spins freely can prevent this problem. Proper air circulation around these components is essential for your Whirlpool refrigerator to freeze correctly.

### Fan Motors: Evaporator and Condenser Fan Failures

Your Whirlpool refrigerator relies on two main fan motors for proper operation. The evaporator fan motor is inside the freezer compartment. Its job is to circulate cold air over the evaporator coils. It then pushes this cold air throughout the freezer and into the fresh food section. If this fan fails, cold air cannot reach your food. Even if the coils are cold, your freezer will not freeze. You might notice the freezer feels slightly cool, but not cold enough to freeze. You might also hear no fan noise when opening the freezer door.

The condenser fan motor is located near the compressor and condenser coils. As mentioned before, its role is to cool down the compressor and condenser coils. If this fan motor fails, the entire cooling system overheats. This prevents the refrigerant from properly cooling. Both fan motors are crucial for maintaining consistent, freezing temperatures.

You can check these fans by listening. Open the freezer door and listen for the evaporator fan. You might need to temporarily press the door switch to keep the light off and the fan running. For the condenser fan, pull the refrigerator away from the wall and listen near the bottom rear. A faulty fan motor usually requires replacement.

### Faulty Temperature Controls and Thermistors

The temperature controls in your Whirlpool refrigerator are crucial for maintaining the right internal temperature. These controls, whether a simple dial or an electronic panel, tell the refrigerator when to cool. If the control board or thermostat becomes faulty, it may not send the correct signals to the compressor and fans. This leads to inconsistent or insufficient cooling. Your refrigerator might think it is colder than it is, thus not running the cooling cycle enough.

Thermistors are small sensors that measure the temperature inside the refrigerator and freezer compartments. They send these readings to the main control board. The board uses this data to decide when to activate the cooling system. If a thermistor fails, it can send inaccurate temperature readings. For example, it might tell the control board that the freezer is cold enough, even when it is not. This prevents the compressor from running as often as it should.

Diagnosing a faulty thermistor often requires testing its resistance with a multimeter. This specific task typically requires a service manual for resistance values. A professional appliance technician can help determine if your control board or thermistor is the root cause. These parts are vital for precise temperature management and overall freezing performance.

### Refrigerant Leaks and Compressor Issues

Refrigerant is the vital fluid that absorbs and releases heat in your refrigerator's cooling cycle. If your Whirlpool refrigerator has a refrigerant leak, it means the system is losing this crucial fluid. Even a small leak can significantly reduce cooling capacity. You might notice the compressor running constantly but the freezer remains warm. Sometimes, you might also hear a faint hissing sound or see an oily residue around the cooling lines. This indicates a leak.

A refrigerant leak is a serious issue. It needs professional attention. Refrigerant is under pressure and requires special tools and training to handle safely. A technician must find the leak, repair it, and then recharge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. This is not a DIY task.

The compressor is the heart of the refrigeration system. It circulates the refrigerant. If the compressor is failing, it cannot properly pressurize the refrigerant. This breaks the cooling cycle. Signs of a failing compressor include loud humming or clicking noises followed by silence. The compressor might also feel extremely hot to the touch. A completely failed compressor will not make any noise at all. Replacing a compressor is complex and expensive. It almost always requires a certified technician. This is usually the last thing to consider if all other simpler fixes have failed. Understanding common freezer issues for other brands like [LG refrigerator freezer not freezing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-refrigerator-freezer-not-freezing) can also shed light on similar symptoms.

### Door Seals and Placement Issues

Even simple factors can prevent your Whirlpool refrigerator from freezing effectively. A common culprit is a faulty door seal, also known as a gasket. The door seal creates an airtight barrier. This keeps warm room air out and cold air in. Over time, seals can become cracked, torn, or loose. When the seal is compromised, warm air constantly leaks into the freezer compartment. This forces the refrigerator to work much harder to maintain its temperature. It might never reach freezing point.

You can check your door seal by performing a simple paper test. Close the freezer door on a dollar bill or a piece of paper. If you can easily pull the paper out, the seal is likely faulty at that spot. You might also feel cold air escaping around the door frame. Cleaning the seals regularly helps them maintain their elasticity. If a seal is damaged, it needs replacement.

The refrigerator's placement also matters. Do not place the unit in direct sunlight or next to a heat source. These include ovens or radiators. Such locations make the refrigerator work overtime to cool. Also, ensure there is adequate space around the refrigerator for air circulation. Most manufacturers recommend at least one inch of space on the sides and back. Blocking vents or overpacking the freezer can also hinder air circulation. This prevents proper freezing.

### Other Less Common but Possible Causes

While frost buildup, fan issues, and refrigerant problems are common, other less frequent issues can also stop your Whirlpool refrigerator from freezing. For instance, a faulty start relay can prevent the compressor from starting. This small component sends power to the compressor. If it fails, the compressor will not turn on. You might hear a clicking sound but no compressor hum.

Another possibility is a defective main control board. This board is the "brain" of your refrigerator. It controls all major functions, including the defrost cycle, fan motors, and compressor. If the board has a malfunction, it might fail to send the correct signals to the cooling components. This results in the refrigerator not freezing. Diagnosing a control board issue often requires advanced testing. This is best left to a professional technician.

Sometimes, issues with the ice maker or water dispenser can indirectly affect freezing. A constantly running water valve or a blocked ice maker line can cause temperature fluctuations. While not directly stopping freezing, it can contribute to a warmer freezer. Always check all components if basic troubleshooting does not resolve the problem. Remember, pinpointing the exact issue sometimes requires a thorough examination of every part of the cooling system.
