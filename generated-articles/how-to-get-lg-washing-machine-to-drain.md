## Troubleshooting Your LG Washing Machine: How to Get It to Drain

There is nothing worse than opening your washing machine only to find a pool of dirty water. This tells us one thing: your LG washing machine will not drain. It is a common problem, and it can disrupt your entire laundry routine. But do not worry, most draining issues are simple to fix yourself. I can help you understand why your LG washer is not draining. We will walk through common causes, from clogged filters to pump problems. This guide provides clear steps to help your LG washing machine drain properly again.

### Takeaway

*   **Check for Power Issues:** Ensure the washer is plugged in and has power. Resetting the circuit breaker can sometimes clear minor glitches.
*   **Inspect the Drain Hose:** Look for kinks, clogs, or improper installation. The hose should be straight and not too far down the standpipe.
*   **Clean the Drain Pump Filter:** This is the most common cause of draining problems. Locate and clear any debris from the pump filter.
*   **Examine the Drain Pump:** Listen for unusual noises. A faulty pump may need professional replacement.
*   **Look for Error Codes:** LG washers display error codes that indicate specific problems. Consult your user manual for their meaning.
*   **Verify the Water Level Sensor:** A malfunctioning sensor can cause the machine to overfill or fail to drain.
*   **Prevent Future Clogs:** Run regular cleaning cycles and inspect the drain filter often.

When your LG washing machine refuses to drain, the most common culprits are a clogged drain pump filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, or a malfunctioning drain pump. Start by checking the filter and hose for obstructions. If these are clear, a pump issue or a pressure sensor problem may be causing the lack of drainage.

## Understanding LG Washing Machine Drainage Problems

Experiencing a washing machine that will not drain can be frustrating. Your LG washing machine uses a specific system to remove water after each cycle. This system includes the drain hose, the drain pump, and a filter. If any part of this system fails, water can remain in the drum. Understanding these parts helps you diagnose the issue.

Many things can cause a draining problem. Sometimes it is a simple clog from lint or small items. Other times, an electrical issue might stop the pump from working. Your machine may even show an error code indicating the problem. I find it useful to start with the easiest checks first. This saves time and avoids unnecessary repairs.

A common reason for no drain is improper installation of the drain hose. The hose needs to be at a specific height. If it is too low, water can siphon out prematurely. If it is too high, the pump struggles to push water out. Always consult your LG washer manual for correct drain hose setup. Knowing how your machine should work helps you spot when it is not performing correctly.

Another aspect to consider is how your LG washing machine cleans itself. Regular cleaning helps prevent clogs. If you do not clean your washing machine often, lint and soap scum can build up. This build-up can block drain paths. So, understanding the usual functions of your LG washing machine is the first step to fixing drain issues.

## Basic Checks When Your LG Washer Won't Drain

When your LG washing machine fails to drain, do not panic. Some basic checks can often solve the problem quickly. I always start by ensuring the machine has power. Sometimes, a simple power glitch can cause a cycle to stop. Make sure the washer is plugged in firmly. You can also try unplugging it for a few minutes, then plugging it back in. This simple step can reset the machine’s internal computer.

Next, I check the circuit breaker. Your washing machine needs a dedicated circuit. If it tripped, the washer loses power. Go to your home’s electrical panel and look for a tripped breaker. Flip it off, then flip it back on. This restores power to the machine. These power checks are quick and easy. They often fix minor electronic glitches preventing drainage.

I also inspect the machine's level. An unbalanced washing machine can sometimes prevent proper draining. If the machine shakes too much, it might pause its cycle or refuse to spin out water. Use a level tool to check if your washer sits flat on the floor. Adjust the leveling legs as needed. This ensures the machine operates correctly throughout the wash cycle.

Finally, I suggest checking the wash cycle settings. Did you select a drain and spin cycle? Sometimes, we accidentally choose a soak cycle or one that does not include a final spin. Make sure the correct cycle is active. If the machine is paused, press start to resume the cycle. These preliminary steps help rule out simple user errors or power interruptions.

## Investigating the Drain Hose for Obstructions

The drain hose is a common culprit when your LG washing machine will not drain. It is the path water takes out of the machine. If this hose gets blocked or kinked, water has nowhere to go. I always inspect the hose first. Look behind your washing machine. See if the hose is bent or pinched. A sharp bend can completely stop water flow. Gently straighten any kinks you find.

Sometimes, the blockage is inside the hose. Lint, small socks, or other debris can get stuck. If you suspect an internal blockage, you may need to disconnect the hose. Prepare for water to come out. Place a bucket under the hose connection points before you start. You can then try to clear the hose. Some people use a garden hose to flush it out. Alternatively, you might need to use a plumber's snake for stubborn clogs.

The drain hose also needs to be at the correct height. If it is too low, the machine might drain constantly, creating a siphon effect. This can lead to the machine filling and draining at the same time. This is called a continuous siphon. If the hose is too high, the drain pump might struggle to push water up. Consult your LG washing machine's user manual for the recommended drain hose height. Typically, it should be between 30 and 96 inches from the floor.

Make sure the hose is not pushed too far into the standpipe. If it is, it can create a tight seal. This prevents air from entering the drain line. This tight seal can also create a siphon effect. Pull the hose out of the standpipe a few inches. Allow an air gap around the hose. If you need to physically remove the drain hose to inspect it thoroughly, you can find specific instructions on [how to remove LG washing machine drain hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-lg-washing-machine-drain-hose).

## Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter

Cleaning the drain pump filter is often the quickest fix for an LG washing machine that won't drain. This filter traps lint, coins, buttons, and other small items. Over time, it can become severely clogged. When it clogs, water cannot pass through to the drain pump. Most LG front-load washers have this filter located at the bottom front. It is usually behind a small access panel. For top-load models, the filter location can vary. Sometimes it is inside the agitator or near the drain hose connection. If you have an LG top-load model, specific instructions on [how to clean top load LG washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-top-load-lg-washing-machine-filter) can be helpful.

Before opening the filter, you must prepare for water. Lay down towels and have a shallow pan ready. Even if your machine drained partially, there will be residual water. First, unplug the washing machine from the power outlet. This is a crucial safety step. Locate the access panel, typically on the lower right or left front. Open the panel. You will see a small hose and a large cap.

Drain the remaining water using the small hose. Pull it out and remove its cap. Let the water drain into your pan. Once the water stops, twist the large cap counter-clockwise to remove the filter. Be ready for more water as you remove it. You might hear some sloshing. Take out the filter. It might be full of lint, hair, or even small toys.

Clean the filter thoroughly under running water. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away any debris. Also, check inside the filter housing for anything stuck there. It is common to find coins or hairpins. Once the filter is clean, screw it back in clockwise. Secure the cap on the small hose and close the access panel. This simple cleaning often resolves the drain issue immediately. I recommend cleaning this filter every few months as part of your regular LG washing machine maintenance.

## Diagnosing a Faulty Drain Pump

If your LG washing machine still won't drain after checking the hose and cleaning the filter, the drain pump might be the problem. The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the machine. A faulty pump cannot do its job. I usually listen for the pump during a drain cycle. A working pump makes a humming noise. If you hear no noise, or only a grinding noise, the pump is likely failing.

First, unplug the washing machine for safety. Access the drain pump. Its location varies by model, but it is usually at the bottom of the machine, behind the front or side panel. You might need to tilt the machine back or lay it on its side to reach it. Once you locate the pump, inspect it visually. Look for any loose wires or clear signs of damage. Sometimes, a foreign object bypasses the filter and jams the pump impeller.

You can try to manually turn the impeller. It is the fan-like part inside the pump. Use a screwdriver to gently turn it. If it does not move freely, something might be stuck. Remove any visible obstructions. Be cautious, as there might be sharp objects. After clearing any debris, try running a drain cycle again. If the pump still does not work, it might need replacement.

Replacing a drain pump can be a bit more involved. It requires disconnecting hoses and electrical wires. If you are comfortable with basic appliance repairs, you can often find replacement pumps online. Make sure you get the correct part number for your LG model. If you are unsure, it is best to call a professional. While this example links to a GE pump, the general process for inspecting and replacing a washing machine drain pump is similar across brands, offering a useful reference for LG owners as well: [how to replace GE washing machine drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-ge-washing-machine-drain-pump).

## Addressing Pressure Sensor Issues

The pressure sensor, also called a water level sensor, tells your LG washing machine how much water is in the drum. This sensor ensures the machine fills correctly. It also signals when the machine is empty so it can drain and spin. If this sensor malfunctions, the machine might think there is no water, even if the drum is full. Conversely, it might believe the drum is still full, preventing the drain cycle from starting. This can lead to your LG washing machine not draining.

A faulty pressure sensor can cause various draining issues. Sometimes the machine will overfill. Other times, it will just sit there with water in it. There are often no obvious visual cues for a bad sensor. I recommend checking the sensor's air trap hose. This is a small, clear tube connected to the bottom of the drum and to the pressure sensor. It can get clogged with soap scum or lint. A clogged air trap hose prevents the sensor from getting an accurate reading.

To check this, first unplug your washing machine for safety. Locate the pressure sensor. It is usually near the top of the washing machine, often under the top panel. The small hose connects to it. Disconnect this hose from both ends. You can blow through it to clear any blockages. If you cannot blow through it, it is clogged. Clean it out with warm water. Reconnect the hose securely.

If cleaning the hose does not work, the sensor itself might be faulty. Testing a pressure sensor requires a multimeter. You measure its resistance or voltage based on the water level. This can be complex for someone without experience. If you are not comfortable with electrical testing, it is best to consult an LG service technician. A new sensor might be needed. This issue can sometimes be misdiagnosed as a drain pump problem.

## Troubleshooting Error Codes and Other Factors

LG washing machines are smart appliances. They often display error codes when something is wrong. When your LG washing machine won't drain, look at the display panel. You might see codes like "OE" (Drain Error) or "IE" (Water Intake Error). An "OE" code specifically indicates a drain problem. This often points to a clogged filter or drain pump issue. If you see an "IE" error, it means the machine is not getting water, which can sometimes indirectly affect draining if the cycle never properly started. Information on [how to fix LG washing machine IE error](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-washing-machine-ie-error) can provide more details on this particular code.

Consult your LG washing machine user manual for a full list of error codes and their meanings. The manual provides specific troubleshooting steps for each code. If you do not have the manual, you can usually find it online on the LG support website. Understanding the error code helps narrow down the problem quickly. It points you to the specific component that needs attention.

Sometimes, the issue is not a specific part failure but related to overload. If you put too many clothes in the washing machine, it can become unbalanced. An unbalanced load prevents the machine from spinning properly. If the spin cycle does not complete, the machine cannot drain all the water. Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines for load size. Distribute clothes evenly in the drum. This helps the machine balance during the spin cycle.

Another factor could be a problem with the main control board. The control board is the brain of the washing machine. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump. If the control board is faulty, it might not tell the pump to activate. This is less common but can happen. Diagnosing a faulty control board is difficult. It usually requires a professional technician. If all other troubleshooting steps fail, the control board might be the cause.

## Preventing Future LG Washing Machine Drain Issues

Maintaining your LG washing machine is key to preventing future drain problems. Regular upkeep ensures your appliance runs smoothly and efficiently. I always recommend following a simple maintenance routine. This helps avoid common clogs and component wear. Preventing issues is always easier than fixing them.

First, make it a habit to check pockets before washing clothes. Small items like coins, keys, or tissues are notorious for causing clogs. They can get stuck in the drain pump filter or even block the drain hose. I have found many unexpected items in my own washer's filter over the years. This simple step can save you a lot of trouble.

Second, clean the drain pump filter regularly. I mentioned this earlier as a fix, but it is also a vital preventative measure. Depending on how often you do laundry and if you have pets, you might need to clean it every few months. For heavily used machines or homes with furry friends, monthly checks are a good idea. This prevents lint and debris from building up.

Third, run a self-clean cycle or a tub clean cycle periodically. Many LG washing machines have a specific cleaning cycle. This cycle uses hot water and sometimes a cleaning agent to remove soap scum, mold, and mildew. These can accumulate in the drum and drain lines. If your machine does not have a dedicated cycle, run an empty hot water wash with a cup of white vinegar or a washing machine cleaner. This helps keep the interior and drain paths clear. You can find more information on [how to clean LG HE washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-he-washing-machine) and how [you can use vinegar to clean LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-vinegar-to-clean-lg-washing-machine) for a thorough cleaning.

Finally, ensure proper detergent usage. Using too much detergent, especially with High-Efficiency (HE) machines, can create excessive suds. These suds can clog drain lines and interfere with the pressure sensor. Always use HE detergent for HE washers. Use only the recommended amount. This prevents residue buildup and allows for proper drainage. Consistent maintenance saves you time, money, and hassle in the long run.

## When to Call a Professional for LG Washer Drain Repair

While many LG washing machine drain issues are fixable yourself, there are times when calling a professional is the best course of action. I know it is tempting to tackle every repair, but some problems require expert knowledge and specialized tools. Knowing when to step back can save you from further damage or injury.

If you have tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned and your LG washing machine still won't drain, it is a good indicator that the problem might be more complex. This includes checking the power, inspecting the hose, cleaning the filter, and looking for error codes. If these basic checks do not resolve the issue, a deeper problem might exist.

Electrical issues are another reason to call a professional. If you suspect a faulty drain pump or pressure sensor but are uncomfortable testing electrical components, do not risk it. Dealing with electricity can be dangerous. A certified technician has the right tools and training to safely diagnose and repair electrical faults. They can test components properly.

Also, if the repair requires extensive disassembly of the washing machine, consider professional help. Some parts are hard to reach or require specific techniques for removal and reinstallation. For example, replacing a main control board or a specific motor component is usually a job for an expert. For example, if you need to replace major components or diagnose complex electrical faults, a service technician is often the best choice. They ensure the repair is done correctly and safely.

Finally, if your LG washing machine is still under warranty, attempts at DIY repair might void it. Check your warranty terms before attempting complex repairs. For peace of mind and to protect your investment, a professional repair is often the smart choice. They can quickly identify the problem and ensure your LG washing machine drains properly again.
