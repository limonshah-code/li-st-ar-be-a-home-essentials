Your Kenmore washing machine works hard, tackling countless loads of laundry. Sometimes, this hard work means you need to perform some maintenance. You might need to get the agitator out of your Kenmore washing machine to retrieve a lost sock or clean deep inside the tub. Perhaps your clothes are not getting clean, or you hear strange noises. Removing the agitator is a common task for these situations.

This guide helps you understand the process. We explain why you might need to remove it, what tools you need, and the exact steps to follow. We also cover what to do if the agitator is stuck. You will find tips for inspecting and cleaning the area once the agitator is out. Follow these clear instructions to safely remove and reinstall your Kenmore agitator.

### Takeaway:

*   Always disconnect power and water before starting.
*   Gather necessary tools like screwdrivers and socket wrenches.
*   Locate and remove the agitator's top cap and retaining bolt.
*   Lift the agitator straight up to remove it.
*   Use penetrating oil and gentle force for stuck agitators.

To get the agitator out of a Kenmore washing machine, first disconnect power and water. Remove the agitator's fabric softener cap, then the inner cap and bolt. Use a socket wrench to loosen the bolt. Once the bolt is free, gently pull the agitator straight up from the wash basket.

## Understanding Your Kenmore Agitator: Why Removal Matters

The agitator is a crucial part inside your Kenmore top-load washing machine. It twists and turns, moving clothes through the water and detergent. This motion helps clean your laundry effectively. Over time, however, things can get trapped under or inside the agitator.

You might need to remove the agitator for several reasons. One common reason is to find small items like socks, coins, or other foreign objects. These items can fall beneath the agitator and cause problems. Another main reason is for thorough cleaning. Mildew and grime can build up in hidden areas, causing odors or reducing cleaning performance. Removing the agitator allows you to reach these spots. This deep cleaning improves your washer's hygiene and efficiency.

Sometimes, agitator removal is part of a repair process. You may need to access internal components, like the transmission or drive block. These parts are often located directly beneath the agitator. If your washer makes strange noises or the agitator does not move correctly, removal is necessary for diagnosis. It ensures you can inspect and fix worn-out parts like the agitator dogs. Knowing how to remove it saves you money on service calls. It lets you maintain your appliance yourself.

## Safety First: Essential Precautions Before You Start

Working with any appliance, especially one connected to water and electricity, demands caution. Your safety is the top priority when working on your Kenmore washing machine. Ignoring safety steps can lead to serious injury or damage to your home. Always take these important precautions before you start any work.

First, and most importantly, disconnect the power supply. Find the washing machine's power cord and unplug it from the wall outlet. This step prevents accidental electrocution. Never attempt to remove the agitator or any part of the machine while it is powered on. Next, turn off the water supply to the washing machine. You will find two water hoses connected to the back of the washer. Turn the valves clockwise until they are completely closed. This prevents water from flooding your laundry area. You can also disconnect the hoses from the back of the machine for added peace of mind, though simply closing the valves is usually sufficient.

Ensure your work area is dry and well-lit. Spills can create slip hazards. Good lighting helps you see small parts and potential issues clearly. Wear protective gloves if you are concerned about grime or sharp edges. Also, gather all your tools before you begin. Having everything ready prevents interruptions and makes the process smoother. This preparation ensures a safe and efficient repair experience.

## Gathering Your Tools: What You Need for Agitator Removal

Before you begin the removal process, gather all the necessary tools. Having the right tools on hand makes the job much easier and prevents frustration. Most of these tools are common household items. You likely have many of them already in your toolbox. Take a moment to collect everything before you start.

First, you will need a flat-head screwdriver or a putty knife. These are useful for prying off the agitator's top cap. Next, a socket wrench set is essential. Kenmore agitators usually have a bolt or nut holding them in place. The size of this bolt can vary, but common sizes include 7/16-inch or 1/2-inch. You might also need a nut driver for specific models. Make sure you have a set with various sizes to fit your particular Kenmore washer.

A pair of vice grips or channel locks can be helpful. They provide extra leverage if the bolt is stubborn or corroded. A flashlight is also a good idea. It helps you see clearly inside the washing machine tub, especially in dimly lit laundry rooms. Finally, keep a towel or rag nearby. You might encounter some residual water or grime during the process. Having all these tools ready will ensure a smooth removal of your Kenmore agitator.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Your Kenmore Agitator

Removing the agitator from your Kenmore washing machine is a straightforward process. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth removal. We break it down into easy-to-follow instructions. This method works for most Kenmore top-load models with a central agitator.

### 1. Preparing the Washer

First, ensure your Kenmore washing machine is completely empty. Remove any clothes or items from the tub. Next, remember our crucial safety steps. Unplug the washing machine from the electrical outlet. Turn off both hot and cold water supply valves connected to the back of the washer. These actions protect you from electrical shock and water leaks. It also creates a safe environment for your work. You can put a towel on the floor around the washer. This helps catch any drips.

### 2. Removing the Fabric Softener Dispenser Cap

Most Kenmore agitators have a cap on top. This cap often doubles as a fabric softener dispenser. You need to remove this cap first. Gently pull it straight up. Some models may require a slight twisting motion. It should pop right off without much force. Set it aside in a safe place where it won't get lost.

### 3. Accessing the Agitator Bolt or Nut

Beneath the fabric softener cap, you will usually find another plastic cap or cover. This inner cap hides the main bolt or nut that secures the agitator. Use a flat-head screwdriver or a small putty knife to gently pry off this inner cap. It might be snug, but it should come off easily. Once this cap is removed, you will see the large bolt or nut in the center of the agitator post. This is the fastener you need to loosen.

### 4. Loosening and Removing the Fastener

Now it is time to remove the main bolt or nut. Use your socket wrench with the correct size socket. Place the socket firmly over the bolt or nut. Turn the wrench counter-clockwise to loosen it. The bolt might be very tight, especially if it has been in place for a long time. Apply steady, firm pressure. If it is stubborn, a short extension handle on your wrench can provide more leverage. Once it is loose enough, you can often finish unscrewing it by hand. Carefully remove the bolt or nut and set it aside with the caps. Losing this fastener can delay reassembly.

### 5. Lifting the Agitator Out

With the fastener removed, the agitator is now free to be pulled out. Grasp the agitator firmly with both hands, one hand near the top and one lower down if possible. Pull the agitator straight up. It should slide off the drive shaft. You might need to wiggle it slightly as you pull. If the agitator is stuck, do not force it excessively. We will cover troubleshooting for stuck agitators in the next section. Once it comes free, lift it completely out of the wash tub. Place it aside carefully, ready for cleaning or inspection.

## Dealing With a Stuck Kenmore Agitator: Troubleshooting Tips

Sometimes, a Kenmore agitator does not come out easily. Years of soap scum, hard water deposits, and corrosion can cause it to seize onto the drive shaft. Do not panic or use excessive force. Forcing it can damage the agitator or the drive shaft. There are several effective techniques to deal with a stuck agitator. Patience is key in these situations.

### 1. Using Penetrating Oil

If the agitator feels stuck after removing the bolt, try using a penetrating oil. Products like WD-40 or similar rust penetrants work well. Spray a generous amount around the base of the agitator post, where it meets the drive shaft. Let the oil sit for at least 15-30 minutes, or even a few hours. This allows the oil to seep into the corrosion and loosen the bond. You might even consider applying it the night before for truly stubborn cases. This step often makes a big difference in freeing a seized agitator.

### 2. Rocking and Wiggling Techniques

After applying penetrating oil, try gently rocking the agitator. Grasp it firmly and gently rock it side-to-side, then front-to-back. Do not twist it aggressively, as this can damage internal components. While rocking, apply upward pressure. You might hear a creaking or popping sound as the bond breaks. Continue to rock and pull simultaneously. This back-and-forth motion helps break any remaining corrosion. It slowly works the agitator free from the drive shaft.

### 3. Using Agitator Removal Tools (When Necessary)

For extremely stubborn agitators, specialized tools are available. An agitator puller is a tool designed to provide consistent upward force. These tools usually hook onto the bottom edge of the agitator. They use a threaded rod to apply leverage, pulling the agitator straight up. While not always necessary for Kenmore agitators, they can be a lifesaver for truly seized ones. You can rent or purchase these tools from appliance parts stores or hardware stores. Remember to use any specialized tool according to its instructions. Avoid any method that involves hitting or hammering the agitator.

## Inspecting and Cleaning Once the Agitator is Out

Once you successfully get the agitator out of your Kenmore washing machine, take advantage of this opportunity. This is a perfect time for thorough inspection and cleaning. You will be surprised by the amount of grime and debris that accumulates in hidden areas. This step is crucial for maintaining your washer's performance and hygiene.

First, inspect the agitator itself. Look at the bottom where it connects to the drive shaft. Check for any build-up of soap scum, lint, or mineral deposits. Also, inspect the "agitator dogs" if your model has them. These are small plastic pieces inside the top half of the agitator that help it move. They can wear out, causing the agitator to spin but not agitate clothes. Replace them if they appear worn or broken. You can easily clean the agitator using warm water and a mild detergent. A stiff brush helps remove stubborn grime. For tough buildup, consider using a vinegar solution.

Next, focus on the wash tub and the drive shaft. The area under the agitator often collects hair, lint, small forgotten items, and mold or mildew. Use a rag to wipe away any visible debris. For stubborn grime, a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water works wonders. Spray it on, let it sit for a few minutes, then scrub with a brush. This is an excellent time to [clean mold from washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing-machine) if you see any. Also, check for foreign objects lodged around the drive shaft. These can cause rattling noises or prevent proper washer operation. Cleaning this area regularly improves your washer's efficiency and helps prevent odors. This deep cleaning helps you maintain a truly clean washing machine. Consider cleaning your [washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter) as well while you have access.

## Reinstalling Your Kenmore Agitator: A Reverse Process

After you have inspected and cleaned your Kenmore agitator and the washer tub, it is time to put everything back together. Reinstallation is essentially the reverse of the removal process. Doing it correctly ensures your washing machine functions properly. Take your time to align everything precisely.

First, position the clean agitator directly over the drive shaft in the center of the washer tub. Align the splines on the agitator with the splines on the drive shaft. Gently lower the agitator onto the shaft. It should slide down smoothly. You may need to wiggle it slightly to ensure it seats properly. Do not force it down. If it resists, lift it, check the alignment, and try again. It needs to sit fully on the drive shaft for correct operation.

Once the agitator is seated, reinsert the main bolt or nut. Thread it back into the drive shaft by hand first to prevent cross-threading. Once it is hand-tight, use your socket wrench to tighten it firmly. Do not overtighten, as this can strip the threads or damage components. A snug fit is sufficient to hold the agitator in place. Next, replace the inner plastic cap that covers the bolt. Press it down firmly until it clicks into place. Finally, put the fabric softener dispenser cap back on the top of the agitator. Push it down until it is secure.

Before using the washer, reconnect the water supply hoses and turn the water valves back on. Plug the washing machine back into the electrical outlet. Run a short test cycle, perhaps an empty rinse and spin, to ensure everything is working correctly. Listen for any unusual noises and observe the agitator's movement. A successful reinstallation means your Kenmore washer is ready for more laundry.
