## Clean Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter: A Complete Guide

Does your Whirlpool dishwasher leave dishes dirty? Is there a strange smell coming from the appliance? I understand these frustrations. The answer often lies in a small, yet mighty, component: the dishwasher filter. A clogged filter severely impacts cleaning performance and can lead to unpleasant odors. Keeping this part clean is essential for sparkling dishes and a healthy kitchen environment.

This guide will walk you through the simple process of how to clean the Whirlpool dishwasher filter. You will learn why cleaning it matters, what tools you need, and a step-by-step method for removal, cleaning, and reinstallation. I will also share important maintenance tips and answer common questions. Let's make your dishwasher work like new again.

### Takeaway

*   Regularly clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter to ensure optimal cleaning.
*   Remove food debris and grease build-up from the filter screens.
*   Use warm soapy water and a soft brush for effective cleaning.
*   Reinstall the filter correctly to prevent damage or poor performance.

### A Quick Answer

To clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter, first remove the lower rack. Locate the filter assembly in the tub's bottom. Twist and lift out the cylindrical and fine mesh filters. Rinse them under warm running water to remove debris. Use a soft brush and mild dish soap for stubborn grime. Finally, reinsert the clean filters securely.

## Why Cleaning Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter Is Essential

You might wonder if cleaning the dishwasher filter truly matters. I can tell you it makes a big difference. Many people overlook this small maintenance task, leading to larger problems. Your Whirlpool dishwasher filter catches food particles and debris during wash cycles. If left uncleaned, these particles accumulate.

A dirty filter restricts water flow. This means your dishwasher cannot spray water effectively. Dishes come out with food bits still stuck on them. You might notice cloudy glasses or a greasy film on plates. This defeats the purpose of running a dishwasher at all. I know how frustrating it is to unload dirty dishes after a wash.

Beyond poor cleaning, a clogged filter causes unpleasant smells. Trapped food debris starts to decompose. This creates foul odors that transfer to your dishes and fill your kitchen. Nobody wants a smelly kitchen or dishes that smell bad. Regular cleaning prevents these issues. It also helps your appliance last longer. It reduces strain on the dishwasher's pump and motor. Think of it as preventative care for your hard-working appliance. Cleaning the filter saves you from needing more serious repairs down the line. It ensures your Whirlpool dishwasher runs efficiently and gives you sparkling clean results every time.

## Gathering Your Tools for Whirlpool Filter Cleaning

Before you start cleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher filter, gather a few basic items. Having everything ready saves time and makes the process smooth. You likely have most of these tools already in your home. I like to be prepared before starting any household task.

Here is what you will need:

*   **Dish Soap:** Choose a mild dish soap. This helps break down grease and food residue. Avoid harsh cleaners.
*   **Soft Brush:** A small, soft-bristled brush works best. An old toothbrush is perfect for this. It can reach into small crevices without scratching the filter.
*   **Warm Water:** You will use warm water for rinsing the filter. It helps dislodge stuck-on particles.
*   **Microfiber Cloth or Paper Towels:** These are useful for wiping down the filter housing area or drying the filter.
*   **Optional - White Vinegar:** For a deeper clean or to remove hard water deposits, white vinegar is an excellent natural cleaner. You can create a dilute solution.

You do not need any special tools for this job. Whirlpool dishwasher filters are designed for easy removal and cleaning by hand. Safety is important too. Make sure the dishwasher is off before you begin. You do not want it to start a cycle accidentally. Having the right tools makes the cleaning process simple and effective. It helps you get your Whirlpool dishwasher filter sparkling clean.

## Locating Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter

Finding the filter in your Whirlpool dishwasher is usually straightforward. Most modern Whirlpool models place the filter in an accessible spot. It is typically at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You do not need to pull out the entire appliance or use special tools to find it. I often find it quickly once I know where to look.

First, open your dishwasher door completely. Then, pull out the lower dish rack. This gives you clear access to the bottom of the tub. Look directly under where the lower spray arm is located. You will see a circular component in the center of the tub floor. This is the filter assembly.

Whirlpool dishwashers generally use a two-part filter system:

1.  **A Cylindrical Filter:** This is the larger, main filter. It looks like a cup or cylinder with mesh on the sides. You will typically twist this to unlock it.
2.  **A Fine Mesh Filter (or Upper Filter Screen):** This flat, larger filter surrounds the cylindrical one. It catches smaller particles. It usually lifts out once the cylindrical filter is removed.

Some older Whirlpool models might have a slightly different filter design, but the location remains the same. It will always be at the bottom of the tub. Once you identify these parts, you are ready for the next step: removing them. Knowing exactly where your filter is makes the rest of the cleaning process much faster. This also helps you understand how the dishwasher drains water and traps debris.

## Removing the Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter

Removing the filter from your Whirlpool dishwasher is a simple process. You will not need any tools for this step. I find it very easy to do by hand. Just make sure the dishwasher is empty before you start.

Follow these steps to safely remove your filter:

1.  **Open the Dishwasher Door and Pull Out the Lower Rack:** Completely pull out the bottom dish rack. This gives you full access to the dishwasher tub's floor. You need a clear view and space to work.
2.  **Locate the Filter Assembly:** As discussed, the filter is a cylindrical component in the center of the tub's floor. It may have a handle or a small arrow indicating how to twist it.
3.  **Twist and Unlock the Cylindrical Filter:** Gently grasp the cylindrical filter. Turn it counter-clockwise about a quarter turn. You might feel a click or hear it unlock. This motion usually frees the filter from its locked position. Do not force it; it should turn easily.
4.  **Lift Out the Cylindrical Filter:** Once unlocked, simply lift the cylindrical filter straight up and out of the tub. It might have some trapped food debris, so be careful not to spill it.
5.  **Remove the Fine Mesh Filter (if applicable):** After the cylindrical filter is out, you will often see a flat, fine mesh filter beneath it or surrounding its base. This second filter usually just lifts straight up. Some models have a slight indentation or tabs to help you grip it. This fine mesh screen catches even smaller particles.

Inspect both parts. You will likely see trapped food particles, grease, and other debris. This is normal but shows why cleaning is necessary. Once both parts are removed, you are ready to clean them. Proper removal ensures you do not damage any delicate parts of the filter or the dishwasher tub. If you need help with the reinstallation process, this guide on [how to put Whirlpool dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-whirlpool-dishwasher-filter-back-in) provides detailed steps.

## Thoroughly Cleaning the Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter

Now that you have removed the filter parts, it is time for the actual cleaning. This step is crucial for restoring your dishwasher's performance. I always make sure to be thorough here.

Here is how to effectively clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter:

1.  **Rinse Under Running Water:** Take both filter parts to your sink. Hold them under warm running water. Use strong water pressure to rinse away loose food particles. You will see a lot of debris wash away quickly. Make sure to rinse both the cylindrical filter and the fine mesh screen.
2.  **Use Dish Soap and a Soft Brush:** For stubborn food residues and greasy buildup, apply a few drops of mild dish soap to your soft brush (an old toothbrush works great). Gently scrub all surfaces of both filter parts. Pay close attention to the mesh screens. Food bits often get stuck in the small holes. Brush away any lingering grime. I find this step really gets rid of the hidden dirt.
3.  **Address Hard Water Stains (Optional):** If you have hard water, you might see white mineral deposits on your filter. You can soak the filter parts in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and warm water for 10-15 minutes. This helps dissolve the mineral buildup. After soaking, scrub gently again and rinse thoroughly.
4.  **Inspect for Damage:** While cleaning, take a moment to inspect the filter parts for any cracks, tears, or damage. A damaged filter cannot trap debris effectively. If you find any damage, you might need to replace the filter. However, cleaning usually solves most issues.
5.  **Rinse Again and Dry:** After scrubbing, rinse both filter parts thoroughly under clean, warm water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. You want to avoid introducing soap suds into your dishwasher. You can let the filters air dry or gently pat them dry with a clean cloth or paper towel before reinstallation.

This thorough cleaning process removes all the accumulated gunk that prevents your dishwasher from working its best. You will notice a significant improvement in dish cleanliness and odor once your filter is spotless. This simple cleaning step is a key part of effective dishwasher maintenance.

## Reinstalling Your Clean Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter

After you have thoroughly cleaned your Whirlpool dishwasher filter, the next step is to put it back in place. Proper reinstallation is just as important as proper removal and cleaning. An incorrectly installed filter can lead to poor wash performance or even damage to your dishwasher. I always make sure it is seated correctly.

Follow these steps for seamless reinstallation:

1.  **Replace the Fine Mesh Filter First:** If your Whirlpool model has a flat, fine mesh filter, place this one back into the bottom of the tub first. It should sit flush against the tub floor. Make sure it aligns correctly with the opening. Some models have specific grooves or tabs to guide placement.
2.  **Insert the Cylindrical Filter:** Now, take the clean cylindrical filter. Carefully lower it into the opening in the center of the fine mesh filter. The cylindrical filter has a specific way it fits. Look for alignment arrows or notches on the filter and the dishwasher tub.
3.  **Twist to Lock the Cylindrical Filter:** Once the cylindrical filter is seated properly, gently push down and twist it clockwise. You should feel it click into place. This lock ensures the filter stays secure during wash cycles. Do not overtighten it. A gentle twist until it clicks is enough. If it does not click, it might not be aligned correctly. Lift it out and try again.
4.  **Return the Lower Dish Rack:** Once both filter parts are securely in place, slide the lower dish rack back into its position. Make sure it glides smoothly.
5.  **Run a Test Cycle (Optional but Recommended):** To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run a short rinse cycle or an empty wash cycle. Listen for any unusual noises. Check for leaks around the filter area after the cycle finishes. This confirms proper reinstallation and seals.

You have now successfully cleaned and reinstalled your Whirlpool dishwasher filter. This routine maintenance step helps your dishwasher perform optimally. It extends the life of your appliance and keeps your dishes sparkling clean.

## Frequency and Maintenance Tips for Your Whirlpool Dishwasher

Knowing how to clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter is great, but knowing *how often* to clean it is equally important. Consistent maintenance ensures your dishwasher always performs at its best. I have learned that a regular schedule is key to keeping my appliances running smoothly.

### How Often Should You Clean It?

The general recommendation for cleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher filter is **once a month**. However, this can vary based on your usage habits:

*   **Daily Use:** If you use your dishwasher every day, especially for dishes with heavy food residue, you might need to check and clean the filter every two to three weeks. I find that families with young children often need more frequent cleaning due to the amount of food scraps.
*   **Light Use:** If you use your dishwasher only a few times a week, a monthly check might be sufficient. You can visually inspect it. If you see visible food particles or a film, it is time to clean it.
*   **Signs of a Clogged Filter:** Regardless of your schedule, clean the filter immediately if you notice signs of a problem. These include dishes not getting clean, a strong odor coming from the dishwasher, or water pooling at the bottom of the tub.

### Additional Maintenance Tips

Beyond filter cleaning, these tips will help maintain your Whirlpool dishwasher:

*   **Scrape Plates Before Loading:** While the filter catches food, scraping large food particles off plates before loading them into the dishwasher significantly reduces filter clogging. This is a simple habit that makes a big difference.
*   **Run a Monthly Dishwasher Cleaner:** Use a specialized dishwasher cleaner or run an empty cycle with a cup of white vinegar in the top rack. This helps remove mineral buildup, soap scum, and odors from the entire tub, spray arms, and hoses.
*   **Clean the Spray Arms:** Periodically check the holes on the spray arms for clogs. Food bits or hard water deposits can block them. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear any obstructions. Clean spray arms mean better water distribution.
*   **Inspect Door Gasket:** Wipe down the rubber gasket around the dishwasher door. Food debris and mold can accumulate here, causing odors. A damp cloth with a little dish soap works well.
*   **Use Proper Detergent:** Always use high-quality dishwasher detergent. Using too much or too little, or using the wrong type of soap, can leave residue and affect performance.

By incorporating these simple maintenance habits, you will keep your Whirlpool dishwasher running efficiently and extend its lifespan. It is an investment in your home and your peace of mind.

## Troubleshooting Common Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues related to your Whirlpool dishwasher filter or general performance. I know that sometimes problems pop up unexpectedly. Understanding common problems helps you diagnose and fix them quickly.

### Dishes Not Getting Clean

This is the most common sign of a dirty or clogged filter. If your dishes come out with food particles, a cloudy film, or feel gritty, the filter is likely the culprit.

*   **Solution:** Follow the steps in this article to thoroughly clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter. Ensure no food particles remain on the mesh screens. Also, check the spray arms for clogs, as they work in conjunction with the filter to clean dishes.

### Unpleasant Odors from the Dishwasher

A persistent bad smell often means decaying food is trapped somewhere. The filter is a primary spot for this.

*   **Solution:** Remove and clean the filter immediately. Pay extra attention to any hidden gunk. You might also need to run an empty hot water cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or a cup of white vinegar to sanitize the entire tub. Check the door gasket too.

### Water Pooling at the Bottom of the Dishwasher

If you find standing water in the bottom of your dishwasher after a cycle, it indicates a drainage issue. A clogged filter can contribute to this.

*   **Solution:** A heavily clogged filter can impede drainage. Remove and clean it thoroughly. Also, inspect the drain hose for kinks or blockages. Sometimes, a clogged air gap (if present on your sink) can also cause this. For more specific insights into this problem, check out [why does my Whirlpool dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom). If your filter specifically appears full of water, this resource on [why is my dishwasher filter full of water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-dishwasher-filter-full-of-water) might offer more tailored solutions.

### Dishwasher Making Unusual Noises

A humming or grinding noise could be due to food particles stuck in the pump or drain area, often exacerbated by an overflowing filter.

*   **Solution:** Clean the filter first. If the noise persists, it might indicate a more serious issue with the drain pump or motor. In such cases, professional assistance might be needed.

### Filter Appears Damaged

While rare, a filter can sometimes get cracked or torn, especially if something sharp falls into the dishwasher.

*   **Solution:** If your filter is visibly damaged, it needs to be replaced. A damaged filter cannot trap debris effectively. Refer to your Whirlpool dishwasher manual for the correct replacement part number or contact Whirlpool customer service.

Addressing these common issues quickly helps maintain your Whirlpool dishwasher's efficiency and prevents minor problems from becoming major repairs. Regular filter cleaning is your first line of defense.

## Understanding Different Types of Dishwasher Filters

While this article focuses on Whirlpool dishwasher filters, it helps to know that not all dishwashers use the same filter system. Understanding the differences can clarify why your Whirlpool model operates in a certain way. This knowledge also explains why some older dishwashers never seem to need filter cleaning.

Generally, dishwashers come with one of two main filter types:

### 1. Manual Clean Filters (Common in Modern Whirlpool Dishwashers)

Most modern Whirlpool dishwashers, like many other brands today, feature a manual clean filter system. This is the type we have discussed throughout this guide.

*   **How it works:** This system uses a multi-stage filter, typically consisting of a coarse filter (cylindrical) and a fine mesh filter. These filters trap food particles of various sizes.
*   **Maintenance:** These filters require regular, manual removal and cleaning. They do not have a built-in grinding mechanism.
*   **Benefits:** Manual clean filters are generally quieter because they do not have a hard food disposer. They also use less water and energy because the water is filtered and reused within the cycle more efficiently. This design is often considered more environmentally friendly.

### 2. Self-Cleaning Filters (Found in Older Models and Some Current Brands)

Older dishwasher models, and some current high-end models from other brands, use a self-cleaning filter system. These are also known as "hard food disposers."

*   **How it works:** Instead of a mesh filter you manually clean, these dishwashers have a grinder or disposer blade. This blade pulverizes food particles into tiny pieces during the wash cycle. These tiny pieces then wash down the drain with the wastewater.
*   **Maintenance:** These systems generally do not require manual filter cleaning. The machine grinds and flushes away the debris.
*   **Benefits:** You do not have to worry about manually cleaning a filter. They are more convenient in that regard.
*   **Drawbacks:** They tend to be louder during operation due to the grinding mechanism. They also often use more water and energy as they typically drain and refill water more frequently.

Knowing which type of filter your specific Whirlpool dishwasher has is important. If you have an older Whirlpool model and cannot locate a removable filter, it might have a self-cleaning system. However, the vast majority of Whirlpool dishwashers produced in recent years (since around 2010) use the manual clean filter that requires your attention. Always check your appliance's user manual for specific details about its filter type and recommended maintenance. This prevents confusion and ensures you care for your dishwasher correctly.

## Conclusion

Taking the time to clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter is a small task that yields significant benefits. It is an essential part of routine appliance maintenance that ensures your dishes come out spotless and your kitchen stays fresh. I hope this comprehensive guide has given you the confidence to tackle this important job.

You have learned why a clean filter is crucial for efficient performance and odor prevention. You now know exactly what tools you need, where to find the filter in your Whirlpool dishwasher, and how to remove, clean, and reinstall it properly. Remember, consistent filter cleaning, ideally monthly, will keep your Whirlpool dishwasher running at its best for years to come. By following these simple steps, you are actively extending the life of your appliance and enjoying the sparkling results you expect. Make this a regular part of your home care routine; your dishes (and nose!) will thank you. Keep your Whirlpool dishwasher filter clean, and enjoy a cleaner, happier home.
