Once you complete the planning, site preparation begins. This phase sets up the physical space for both indoor and outdoor units. Proper preparation ensures efficient operation. It also prevents future maintenance problems. Taking care now streamlines the installation process.

### Outdoor Unit Placement

The outdoor condenser unit needs a specific location. It should be on a level, solid pad. This pad prevents vibrations and provides stability. The unit also needs clear space around it for airflow. Obstructions like bushes or walls can block air. This reduces efficiency. Maintain at least 12-24 inches of clearance on all sides. Consider noise levels for nearby windows or patios. Placing the unit away from bedrooms helps reduce sound impact. Also, ensure the chosen spot allows for easy access. This makes future maintenance simple. A well-placed outdoor unit performs better and lasts longer.

### Indoor Unit (Air Handler/Furnace) Placement

The indoor unit, often called the air handler or furnace, also needs careful placement. It is typically in an attic, basement, utility closet, or crawl space. The location must offer enough space for installation and future service. Ensure the unit is level. Secure it properly to joists or a sturdy platform. Access to existing ductwork is critical. You might need to modify or extend ducts. Plan for condensate drainage from this unit. A slight slope for the drain line prevents standing water. Proper placement of the indoor unit ensures efficient air distribution throughout your home. This leads to consistent comfort.

### Preparing for Line Set and Electrical Runs

The path for the refrigerant line set, electrical wiring, and condensate drain line needs careful planning. You will need to drill holes through exterior walls or floors. Ensure these holes are correctly sized. They must allow for the lines to pass through without damage. Always seal these penetrations thoroughly after installation. This prevents air leaks and moisture intrusion. Consider the shortest possible runs for lines. Longer runs can reduce efficiency. Protect lines from sharp edges or potential damage during routing. Proper preparation of these pathways ensures safe and efficient connections. It saves a lot of time and effort during the actual hook-up process.

## 3. Mounting the Units and Running Lines

With site preparation complete, you can begin the physical installation. Mounting the indoor and outdoor units correctly is vital. Running the refrigerant lines precisely ensures system integrity. This stage requires attention to detail. Proper connections prevent leaks and ensure efficient operation.

### Securing the Outdoor Condenser Unit

The outdoor Goodman condenser unit requires a stable base. Most installations use a dedicated HVAC pad. This pad is typically made of concrete or composite material. Ensure the pad is perfectly level. An uneven unit can vibrate excessively. This leads to premature wear. Use bolts or straps to secure the unit to the pad if recommended by the manufacturer. Some installations might use wall-mounted brackets. These are common for units placed higher up or in flood zones. Always ensure the mounting hardware can support the unit's weight. Proper securing minimizes noise and prolongs the unit's lifespan.

### Installing the Indoor Air Handler

The indoor air handler or furnace must be mounted securely. It attaches to structural elements like ceiling joists or wall studs. Use appropriate hangers or supports. Make sure the unit remains level. Level installation is important for proper condensate drainage. Connect the existing ductwork to the air handler's supply and return plenums. Ensure these connections are airtight. Use mastic or foil tape to seal all seams. This prevents air loss and maintains system efficiency. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for exact mounting procedures. A stable and sealed indoor unit performs optimally.

### Running and Connecting the Refrigerant Line Set

The refrigerant line set connects the outdoor condenser to the indoor air handler. It consists of two copper lines: a larger suction line and a smaller liquid line. Measure the distance accurately. Cut the copper lines to the correct length. Use a pipe cutter for clean, burr-free cuts. You must flare the ends of the copper tubing. This creates a tight seal when connected to the unit. Use a flare tool for this step. Connect the flared ends to the service valves on both units. Use two wrenches when tightening flare nuts. One wrench holds the valve steady. The other tightens the nut. This prevents twisting the valve assembly. Avoid kinks or sharp bends in the lines. Protect the lines from physical damage during routing. Properly connected lines are critical for refrigerant containment.

## 4. Electrical Wiring and Condensate Drainage

Connecting the power and managing water runoff are critical steps. Incorrect wiring can be dangerous. Improper drainage leads to water damage and mold growth. This section ensures your system receives power safely. It also handles the moisture byproduct efficiently.

### Wiring the Outdoor Unit

The outdoor Goodman unit requires a dedicated power supply. First, ensure the power is off at the main breaker. Install a weatherproof disconnect box near the outdoor unit. This box allows you to cut power directly at the unit for service. Run appropriately sized electrical wire from your main electrical panel to this disconnect box. Then, connect the wire from the disconnect box to the outdoor unit's electrical terminals. Always follow the wiring diagram provided by Goodman. It shows specific connections for power and control wiring. Improper wiring can damage the unit. It also poses fire hazards. Double-check all connections before restoring power. Safety is the main concern here.

### Wiring the Indoor Unit and Thermostat

The indoor air handler also needs electrical power. Run a separate electrical circuit from your main panel to the indoor unit. Again, ensure the power is off at the breaker. Connect the power wire to the unit's terminals according to its specific wiring diagram. Next, connect the thermostat wire. This low-voltage wire links the indoor unit to your thermostat. The thermostat controls the system's operation. Each wire color corresponds to a specific function (e.g., heating, cooling, fan). Match these colors precisely to the terminals on both the air handler and the thermostat. Consult both units' wiring diagrams for exact connections. Testing continuity can confirm proper wiring. Take your time to get these connections right.

It helps you understand why professional help is often necessary for these parts of the installation.

### Setting Up the Condensate Drain

Both the indoor and outdoor units produce condensate, which is water. The indoor unit's drain line must have a continuous downward slope. This allows water to flow by gravity. Use PVC pipe for the drain line. Connect it to an existing drain, like a utility sink or a dedicated condensate drain. Install a P-trap in the line near the indoor unit. This P-trap creates a water seal. It prevents odors and air from being drawn into the system. Without a P-trap, air can bypass the fan, causing issues. Some indoor units might need a condensate pump if gravity drainage is not possible. Ensure all connections are watertight. Proper drainage prevents water damage and mold growth.

## 5. Evacuation and Refrigerant Charging

This stage is perhaps the most critical. It involves specialized equipment and technical knowledge. Proper evacuation and charging ensure your Goodman heat pump runs efficiently. Mistakes here can severely damage the system. They also void your warranty.

### Evacuating the Refrigerant Lines

Before introducing refrigerant, you must remove all air and moisture from the copper lines. This process is called evacuation. Air and moisture can mix with refrigerant. This forms acids that corrode internal components. It also reduces efficiency. Connect a vacuum pump to your manifold gauge set. Connect the gauge set to the service ports on the outdoor unit. Open the valves on the gauge set. Turn on the vacuum pump. Pull a deep vacuum, typically below 500 microns. Monitor the vacuum gauge until it stabilizes. Close the manifold valves. Let the system sit under vacuum for at least 30 minutes. This "hold test" confirms there are no leaks in the system. A stable vacuum reading means your lines are clean and sealed.

### Charging the System with Refrigerant

Goodman heat pump units often come pre-charged with refrigerant. This charge is for a standard line set length. If your line set is longer, you will need to add more refrigerant. Adding or removing refrigerant is a precise task. You must use a refrigerant scale for accuracy. It is important to calculate the exact amount needed. Too much or too little refrigerant hurts efficiency. It also reduces the system's lifespan. Most importantly, federal regulations limit who can purchase and handle refrigerants. Only EPA-certified HVAC technicians can do this. Improper handling releases harmful chemicals into the environment. It is dangerous for an untrained person. This step often requires professional help for safety, compliance, and warranty.

### Initial Power Up and Checks

Before turning on the main power, perform a final visual inspection. Check all electrical connections for tightness. Ensure no loose wires are present. Confirm all refrigerant line connections are secure. Open the service valves on the outdoor unit. These valves were closed during the vacuum and charging process. Now, they must be fully open for refrigerant flow. Next, go to your main electrical panel. Turn on the circuit breakers for both the indoor and outdoor units. Listen for any unusual noises. This initial power up is a critical moment. It confirms your electrical work is sound.

### Performance Verification

After powering up, activate the system through the thermostat. Test both heating and cooling modes. In cooling mode, check the air temperature coming out of the supply vents. It should be significantly cooler than the return air. Measure the temperature differential. Typically, a 15-20 degree Fahrenheit difference is ideal. In heating mode, the air should be warmer. Check the outdoor unit's fan and compressor operation. Monitor system pressures and temperatures using your manifold gauges. Confirm the condensate drain is flowing properly. Listen for any unusual sounds. These checks ensure the system delivers comfort as expected.
