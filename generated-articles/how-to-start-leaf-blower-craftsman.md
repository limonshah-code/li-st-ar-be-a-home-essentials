For electric or battery models, connect power, then press the start button or pull the trigger.

## Understanding Your Craftsman Leaf Blower Model

Craftsman makes different types of leaf blowers. Each type has its own starting method. Knowing your model helps you start it correctly. You might have a gas-powered, electric, or battery-powered unit. Gas models are common for heavy duty work. They need fuel and engine oil. Electric models plug into an outlet. Battery models use a rechargeable battery pack.

Gas models often come in two-cycle or four-cycle versions. Two-cycle engines need a specific fuel-oil mix. Four-cycle engines use straight gasoline and have a separate oil reservoir. Look at your Craftsman leaf blower manual. It tells you the exact type. This information is important for proper use. It also helps with maintenance.

Electric and battery models are simpler. They do not use gasoline. This means less maintenance. They also produce no emissions during use. They are usually lighter. Battery technology improves regularly. These models offer great convenience. They are ready to use quickly. Just charge the battery or plug it in.

*   **Gas-Powered Craftsman Leaf Blowers:**
    *   **Two-cycle:** These engines mix oil directly with gasoline. You need the right fuel-to-oil ratio. This ratio is crucial for engine health.
    *   **Four-cycle:** These engines have separate oil and gas tanks. You fill them independently. This is similar to a car engine.
*   **Electric Craftsman Leaf Blowers:**
    *   These plug into an electrical outlet. They provide constant power. They are good for smaller yards.
*   **Battery-Powered Craftsman Leaf Blowers:**
    *   These use a rechargeable battery. They offer cordless freedom. Battery life varies by model.

Knowing your model type makes starting it easier. It also helps you perform the right checks. Always confirm your model type before you begin. This prevents damage and ensures safety.

## Pre-Start Checks: Fuel, Oil, and Air

Before you start your Craftsman leaf blower, check a few things. These checks ensure the blower starts easily. They also keep it running well. First, verify your fuel supply. Gas models need the correct fuel. If you have a two-cycle engine, mix gasoline with two-cycle oil. Use the ratio specified in your Craftsman manual. For a four-cycle engine, use fresh, unleaded gasoline. [What gas does leaf blower use?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-gas-does-leaf-blower-use) This is a common question, and using the wrong fuel can harm your engine.

Next, check the oil. If your Craftsman blower is a four-cycle model, inspect the oil level. Add oil if it is low. Use the oil type recommended by Craftsman. Two-cycle models get their lubrication from the oil mixed with the fuel. So, no separate oil check is needed there. Fresh fuel is always best. Stale fuel can cause starting problems. Old fuel can gum up the carburetor.

The air filter also needs a check. A dirty air filter restricts airflow. This can make starting difficult. It can also cause the engine to run poorly. Locate your air filter. It is usually under a cover on the side of the engine. Remove the cover. Inspect the filter element. If it is dirty, clean or replace it. [How to clean leaf blower air filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leaf-blower-air-filter) guides you through this simple process. A clean air filter helps your engine breathe better.

Finally, check the spark plug. A good spark plug creates a strong spark. This spark ignites the fuel. A dirty or damaged spark plug will prevent starting. You might need a spark plug wrench to remove it. Inspect the electrode for deposits or damage. Clean or replace it if necessary. These simple checks save time later. They prevent frustration when trying to start your Craftsman leaf blower.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Gas Craftsman Leaf Blowers

Starting a gas-powered Craftsman leaf blower involves specific steps. Follow them in order for the best results. I will guide you through each one. This process works for most two-cycle and four-cycle Craftsman models. First, place the blower on a flat, stable surface. Make sure no objects are near the exhaust or air intake. Safety is always important.

**1. Fueling the Blower:**
    *   Make sure your fuel tank has enough fresh fuel.
    *   If it is a two-cycle model, use the correct gas-oil mix.
    *   If it is a four-cycle model, use unleaded gasoline. Also, check the oil reservoir separately.

**2. Set the Choke:**
    *   Locate the choke lever. It is usually on the side of the engine.
    *   Move the choke lever to the "FULL CHOKE" or "START" position. This enriches the fuel-air mixture. This is critical for a cold engine start.

**3. Press the Primer Bulb:**
    *   Find the primer bulb. It is a small, clear bubble.
    *   Press the primer bulb 5 to 10 times. You will see fuel filling the bulb. Stop when the bulb stays filled with fuel. This pushes fuel into the carburetor. It helps with the initial start.

**4. Engage the Throttle Lock (if applicable):**
    *   Some Craftsman models have a throttle lock or high-idle setting.
    *   Set the throttle to the "ON" or "RUN" position. Engage the throttle lock if your model has one. This keeps the engine at a higher RPM during starting.

**5. Pull the Starter Cord:**
    *   Grip the handle firmly with one hand. Place your foot on the base of the blower for stability.
    *   With your other hand, pull the starter cord slowly until you feel resistance. This is the compression stroke.
    *   Once you feel resistance, pull the cord quickly and smoothly. Do not pull the cord to its full extension. Avoid letting the cord snap back. Repeat this 2-3 times. The engine should "cough" or try to start.

**6. Move Choke to Half-Choke/Run:**
    *   Once the engine "coughs" or briefly runs, move the choke lever to the "HALF CHOKE" or "RUN" position.
    *   Pull the starter cord again 1-3 times. The engine should fully start.

**7. Disengage Choke and Warm Up:**
    *   As the engine runs smoothly, move the choke lever completely to the "RUN" position.
    *   Let the engine warm up for about 30 seconds before using it. This allows the engine to stabilize.

If your Craftsman leaf blower does not start after these steps, do not worry. We will cover troubleshooting common issues next. But following these steps usually gets it running.

    *   **Solution:** Inspect the primer bulb for cracks. Press it and watch for fuel movement. If it does not draw fuel or is damaged, replace it.

**6. Carburetor Problems:**
    *   **Problem:** The carburetor mixes air and fuel. It can get clogged with old fuel deposits. This is a common reason for a leaf blower that won't start or runs poorly.
    *   **Solution:** For minor clogs, try a carburetor cleaner. For severe clogs, the carburetor may need cleaning or rebuilding. Sometimes, replacement is necessary.

**7. No Spark:**
    *   **Problem:** Even with a good spark plug, there might be no spark if the ignition coil is bad or the kill switch is on.
    *   **Solution:** Check the spark plug wire connection. Ensure the kill switch is in the "ON" position. Test for spark using a spark plug tester. If there is no spark, the ignition coil might be faulty.

If your Craftsman leaf blower still won't start after these checks, consider professional service. But usually, one of these simple fixes solves the problem.
