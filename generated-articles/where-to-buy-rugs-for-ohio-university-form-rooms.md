### Key Factors: Size, Material, and Cleaning

These three factors are critical for any dorm room rug. Addressing them upfront guarantees satisfaction. Students need durable, manageable rugs.

1.  **Size:**

Runner rugs might work for narrow spaces or hallways within a larger suite.

3.  **Cleaning and Maintenance:**
    *   **Stain Resistance:** Dorm rooms are prone to spills. Look for rugs labeled "stain-resistant" or "easy-clean."
    *   **Washability:** Small rugs can sometimes be machine washed. Larger area rugs typically require spot cleaning or professional cleaning. Know how to care for your rug before you buy it. For instance, knowing [how to remove sda stain form carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-sda-stain-form-carpet) might prove useful for common dorm spills.
