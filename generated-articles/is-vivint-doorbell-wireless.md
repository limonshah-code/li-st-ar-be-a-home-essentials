## How Vivint Doorbells Connect to Your Smart Home

Vivint doorbells are part of a larger smart home ecosystem. Their connectivity extends beyond just power. They use wireless technologies to communicate with other devices.

## Vivint Doorbell Installation: Professional vs. DIY

The installation process for a Vivint doorbell is an important consideration. Vivint primarily relies on professional installation for its products. This approach ensures proper setup and optimal performance for your wired doorbell camera. While some smart doorbells offer easy DIY options, Vivint takes a different path.
