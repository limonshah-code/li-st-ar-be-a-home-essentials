It can make finding the right appliance seem difficult. I understand this specific query. Many homeowners face size challenges when upgrading kitchen appliances.

### Clear Answer: Do They Make 23.5-Inch Dishwashers?

No, manufacturers do not commonly make 23.5-inch dishwashers as a standard size. The primary standard width for built-in dishwashers in North America is 24 inches. For smaller spaces, the common compact or slimline size is 18 inches wide. A 23.5-inch measurement usually indicates a slightly undersized cabinet opening for a standard 24-inch unit.

### Understanding Standard Dishwasher Dimensions

Let's discuss common dishwasher sizes. Knowing these sizes helps you plan your kitchen. Standard dishwashers come in predictable dimensions. This helps builders and homeowners. It simplifies appliance replacement.

The most common width for built-in dishwashers in North America is 24 inches. This size fits into standard kitchen cabinetry. Most kitchen layouts include a 24-inch wide slot for a dishwasher. These units usually measure 23 7/8 inches to 23 9/16 inches wide. This allows for slight clearance during installation. It ensures a snug fit against existing cabinets. These models offer the largest capacity. They hold more dishes. This makes them popular for families.

Another common width is 18 inches. These are called compact or slimline dishwashers. They are much narrower. They fit into smaller kitchen spaces. An 18-inch unit is useful in apartments or small homes. They are also good for kitchens with limited cabinet runs. While they save space, they hold fewer dishes. This is a trade-off for their small footprint. They still offer full cleaning power.

Beyond width, depth and height are also important. Most built-in dishwashers are about 24 inches deep. This depth matches standard kitchen counters. Height usually ranges from 33.5 to 34.5 inches. This allows them to slide under most countertops. Adjustable feet on the dishwasher help with leveling. They ensure a flush fit with the counter. You must consider all three dimensions when buying.

These standard sizes exist for a good reason. They fit common cabinet dimensions. This makes kitchen design easier. It ensures a smooth installation process. Deviations from these sizes can cause problems. It makes finding a suitable unit hard. This is why a 23.5-inch measurement is unusual.

### Why 23.5 Inches Poses a Challenge

A measurement of 23.5 inches for a dishwasher opening presents a specific problem. As we discussed, standard dishwashers are 24 inches wide. This half-inch difference might seem small. However, it is a significant obstacle for appliance installation. Dishwashers need precise clearances. They must slide into place smoothly.

A 23.5-inch opening means a standard 24-inch dishwasher will not fit. It will be too wide. You cannot force a larger appliance into a smaller space. This can damage the dishwasher or the cabinets. It prevents proper installation. This half-inch often comes from a mismeasurement. It might also be due to older or custom cabinetry. Some older homes have slightly different cabinet dimensions.

The challenge is that no manufacturers specifically make a 23.5-inch wide dishwasher. You won't find this size listed in product catalogs. Appliance stores do not stock this dimension. This leaves you with limited options. You cannot simply order a unit to fit this exact gap. You must address the space issue itself.

Installation issues are major with an incorrect size. A dishwasher needs enough room to slide in. It also needs space for plumbing and electrical connections. If the opening is too tight, you cannot make these connections. You cannot pull the dishwasher out for maintenance or repairs. The appliance may not level properly. This leads to vibration or leaks.

You might need to adjust your cabinet opening. This means widening the space by half an inch. A carpenter can often do this. They might shave down a cabinet side. They could adjust a filler strip. This is an extra step and cost. It is often necessary to fit a standard 24-inch dishwasher. Otherwise, you must look at much smaller options. This significantly impacts your choices.

### Exploring Compact and Slimline Dishwashers

When a 24-inch dishwasher won't fit, compact models become a strong alternative. These units are specifically designed for smaller spaces. The most common compact size is 18 inches wide. These are often called slimline dishwashers. They are ideal for kitchens where space is a premium. This includes small apartments, condos, or accessory dwelling units.

An 18-inch dishwasher offers a built-in solution. It looks like a standard dishwasher. It slides into a cabinet opening. These units provide full washing capabilities. They use less water and energy per cycle. Their smaller size means they fit into narrower cabinet runs. This is a good option if your opening is significantly less than 24 inches. They certainly fit into a 23.5-inch space with ample room to spare.

The main drawback of an 18-inch unit is capacity. They hold fewer dishes compared to a 24-inch model. A standard 24-inch dishwasher can hold 12-14 place settings. An 18-inch model typically holds 8-10 place settings. This means you might run the dishwasher more often. For singles, couples, or small families, this might not be an issue. Large families might find the capacity limiting.

Many brands offer 18-inch dishwashers. You can find them with various features. They include stainless steel interiors, multiple wash cycles, and delay start options. Some even have smart features. They are not just basic models. They provide similar technology to their larger counterparts. This gives you choices in features and finishes.

Another type of compact solution is a dishwasher drawer. These are different from traditional dishwashers. They look like a kitchen drawer. You pull them out to load dishes. You can install one or two drawers. Each drawer operates independently. This offers flexibility. One drawer can run while the other is still loading. This is an excellent option for tight kitchens. It also works for those who only wash a few dishes at a time. Are you curious if these are a good choice?

### Alternative Dishwasher Solutions for Tight Kitchens

Sometimes, even an 18-inch built-in dishwasher might not be feasible. Kitchens come in all shapes and sizes. Some homes have no suitable built-in space at all. In these situations, several alternative solutions exist. These options help you enjoy the convenience of a dishwasher. They do so without needing major renovations.

One popular alternative is the portable dishwasher. These units are freestanding. They sit on wheels. You can move them around the kitchen. When you want to use it, you roll it to the sink. You connect it to your faucet with a special adapter. Once the cycle finishes, you disconnect it. Then, you can store it out of the way. Many portable models are similar in width to 18-inch or even 24-inch built-in units. They offer good capacity. Their mobility is their biggest advantage. They are perfect for renters or those who cannot alter their kitchen cabinetry.

Another option is the countertop dishwasher. As the name suggests, these units sit directly on your kitchen counter. They are much smaller than built-in or portable models. They connect to your sink faucet. Countertop dishwashers are very compact. They hold 4-6 place settings. This makes them ideal for individuals or couples. They are easy to install and move. They also require no permanent plumbing changes. The main drawback is they take up valuable counter space.

For homes with unique layouts, single dishwasher drawers offer a clever solution. We briefly mentioned these before. You can install a single drawer under a counter. You can place it in an island. Or, you can even put it in an elevated cabinet. This flexibility makes them good for custom kitchens. They are great for homes where only one or two people live. They are also energy efficient for small loads.

Consider these options if your 23.5-inch space is fixed. They provide cleaning power without major construction. Each type offers different benefits regarding size, capacity, and installation. Your choice depends on your specific kitchen needs. It also depends on how much flexibility you have.

### Measuring Your Space Accurately for a New Dishwasher

Accurate measurement is the most important step before buying a dishwasher. A small error can lead to big problems. It can cause an appliance to not fit. It can lead to installation delays. I always advise homeowners to measure twice. This prevents costly mistakes.

Start with the width of the opening. Use a tape measure. Measure the width from cabinet side to cabinet side. Take measurements at the top, middle, and bottom of the opening. Use the smallest measurement you get. This ensures the dishwasher will slide in without catching. Remember, standard dishwashers are 24 inches wide. This means your opening should be at least 24 inches. If it is 23.5 inches, you know you have a problem.

Next, measure the height. Measure from the floor to the underside of your countertop. Take this measurement at the front, middle, and back of the opening. Dishwashers typically have adjustable feet. This allows for minor height adjustments. Most standard dishwashers are between 33.5 and 34.5 inches high. Ensure your opening falls within this range. If your floors are uneven, consider this.

Finally, measure the depth of the space. Measure from the front edge of your cabinets to the wall behind. Also, consider any plumbing or electrical outlets. These can take up space. Standard dishwasher depth is around 24 inches. Most models are designed to sit flush with your cabinets. Leave enough room for water lines and electrical connections. Remember that the door will extend out when open. Ensure you have clearance for the door.

When measuring, note any obstacles. These include baseboards, floor tiles, or unusual plumbing. These things can affect the fit. Always round down to the nearest eighth or sixteenth of an inch. This ensures a little wiggle room. It is better to have a slightly loose fit than one that is too tight. A proper measurement ensures a smooth appliance upgrade.

### The Installation Realities of Dishwasher Sizes

Installing a dishwasher requires precision. The size of your appliance and the opening must match. If they do not, you face significant installation challenges. Even a small difference, like our 23.5-inch scenario, creates issues. I have seen homeowners struggle with ill-fitting appliances. It creates frustration and extra costs.

If your space is too narrow for a standard 24-inch dishwasher, a professional installer will face difficulties. They cannot force the unit into the space. Doing so risks damaging the dishwasher's exterior. It can also scratch or splinter your cabinets. The installer might suggest widening the opening. This involves carpentry work. They might need to trim cabinet sides. This adds to the project timeline and expense. It requires skill to do correctly.

Proper clearance is vital for operation. A dishwasher needs a little space around its sides. This allows for proper ventilation. It also allows for the door to open freely. If the fit is too tight, the door might scrape against cabinets. This prevents proper sealing. It can also lead to noise issues. Airflow around the motor is also important for longevity.

Connecting the dishwasher also needs space. Water supply lines, drainage hoses, and electrical wires run behind the unit. If the opening is too narrow, there might not be enough room for these connections. You must ensure the [dishwasher can pump water out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-dishwashers-pump-water-out) efficiently. This means having the drain hose installed correctly and without kinks. A cramped space makes this difficult. It can lead to leaks or poor drainage.

Levelling the dishwasher is another critical step. Dishwashers must be level to operate correctly. This prevents water pooling or rocking during cycles. If the unit is wedged into a too-small space, leveling becomes impossible. The feet cannot be adjusted. This leads to unbalanced operation. It shortens the appliance's lifespan. An installer will refuse to complete a job if the fit is too tight. They know it will lead to problems. You might need to buy a smaller appliance or modify your cabinets.

### Where to Find Dishwashers That Fit Your Needs

Finding the right dishwasher size is key. You want a unit that fits your space. You also want one that meets your cleaning needs. Once you know your exact measurements, you can begin your search. Several places offer a wide range of options.

Major appliance retailers are a great starting point. Stores like Lowe's, Home Depot, Best Buy, and other local appliance stores carry many brands. They stock both 24-inch standard models and 18-inch compact units. These stores often have floor models. You can see the dishwashers in person. You can open doors and check interior layouts. Sales associates can help answer questions. They can also explain features. Many stores offer delivery and installation services. This simplifies the process for you.

Online retailers also offer extensive selections. Websites like Amazon, Wayfair, and the direct websites of appliance brands provide many choices. You can easily filter by width, height, and depth. This helps you narrow down options quickly. Online stores often have competitive pricing. They also offer customer reviews. These reviews give insights from other buyers. Just be careful with return policies for large appliances. Make sure you understand them before buying.

For specific needs, consider specialty appliance stores. These stores might have a wider range of compact or unique models. They often cater to designers or contractors. They might offer brands not found in big box stores. If you have a very specific size constraint, they could offer custom solutions. They might also have experienced staff who can advise on tricky installations.

If you are looking for local options, consider searching for [where to buy dishwashers near me](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-to-buy-dishwashers-near-me). This helps you find stores in your area. You can then visit them in person. This approach can be very helpful for comparing models directly.

Remember to consider your budget. Dishwashers range widely in price. Features, brand, and size affect the cost. Think about energy efficiency. Look for Energy Star certified models. These save money on utility bills. They also help the environment. Do your research. Read reviews. This ensures you find the best dishwasher for your home and your specific opening.
