## Restore Your Amana Microwave: Handle Replacement Guide

Has your Amana microwave handle broken off or become loose? It is frustrating when essential appliances do not work correctly. A broken microwave handle makes it hard to open the door, and it can even be a safety risk. You do not need to buy a new microwave just for a handle.

This guide helps you fix the issue yourself. We show you exactly how to replace handle on Amana microwave models. You will learn about the tools you need, how to stay safe, and step-by-step instructions. Get ready to make your Amana microwave fully usable again with a simple DIY repair.

### Takeaway

*   Always unplug your Amana microwave before starting any repair work.
*   Identify your microwave's model number to get the correct replacement handle.
*   Gather basic tools like screwdrivers and a pry tool before you begin.
*   Follow specific steps to safely remove the old handle and install the new one.
*   Test the new handle and door function thoroughly after replacement.

Replacing the handle on an Amana microwave involves disconnecting power, often removing a few screws, detaching the inner door panel, unscrewing the old handle, then securing the new handle, and reassembling the door. This process restores proper function and safety to your appliance.

## Why Replace Your Amana Microwave Handle?

A broken Amana microwave handle creates many problems. First, it makes your microwave hard to use. You might struggle to open the door, or the door might not close completely. This issue means your microwave cannot heat food properly.

Second, a damaged handle can be a safety concern. If the door does not latch tightly, microwave energy could leak out. This is a rare but serious risk. A loose handle also makes the door harder to control, which can cause spills. Fixing the handle ensures safe operation.

Finally, replacing the handle yourself saves money. Buying a new microwave is expensive. A simple handle repair costs much less. It extends the life of your current appliance, giving it many more years of use. This repair makes your kitchen function well again.

## Getting Ready: Tools and Amana Replacement Parts

Before you start any repair, gather all your items. You need the right tools to do the job correctly. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and fast. This avoids delays once you begin.

You will need a few basic hand tools. A set of Phillips head and flathead screwdrivers is a must. Sometimes, a smaller precision screwdriver helps with tiny screws. A plastic pry tool or putty knife is useful for opening the inner door panel without damage. Work gloves offer protection for your hands.

Finding the correct replacement handle for your Amana microwave is important. Each model has a specific handle design. Look for your microwave's model number. It is usually inside the door frame or on the back of the unit. Once you have the model number, search online for "Amana [Your Model Number] microwave handle." You can find parts on appliance parts websites or directly from Amana. Always try to get an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) part for best fit.

## Safety Measures for Microwave Handle Repair

Safety comes first when working with any appliance. Microwaves use high voltage, even when unplugged. Taking proper safety steps protects you from harm. Do not skip this section.

First, unplug your Amana microwave from the wall outlet. This stops all power flow to the unit. Do not just turn it off at the control panel. Pull the plug completely out of the socket.

Second, ensure your workspace is clear and well-lit. You need room to work comfortably. Remove any items from around the microwave. This prevents accidents and allows you to move freely.

Third, wear work gloves. These protect your hands from sharp edges or small cuts. While a handle replacement usually does not involve exposing internal high-voltage components, basic protection is always a good idea. Handle replacement generally happens on the door itself, which is safe once unplugged. You can read about general microwave repair safety, for example, when replacing a fuse in a GE microwave, to understand more about internal electrical components.

## Removing the Old Amana Microwave Handle

The first step in replacement is taking off the broken handle. This part often involves finding hidden screws. Do not force anything; work slowly to avoid damage. Each microwave model can be a little different.

Start by opening the microwave door. Look along the inside edge of the door. Many Amana microwave handles attach with screws accessible from the inner side of the door panel. You might see plastic plugs covering these screws. Gently pry these plugs off with a small screwdriver or a plastic pry tool. Some models may require you to separate the inner and outer door panels slightly to reach the screws. Be careful not to crack the plastic.

Once you find the screws, use the correct screwdriver to loosen them. Support the handle as you remove the last screw so it does not fall. Carefully pull the old, broken handle away from the door. Note how the handle attaches to the door posts; this helps with new handle installation.

### How to Access Internal Screws (If Applicable)

Sometimes, the handle screws are not directly visible. You may need to separate the inner door panel. This usually involves prying around the seam of the door frame. Use a plastic pry tool to gently separate the two halves. Work slowly around the entire edge. Be gentle to avoid breaking plastic clips or tabs. Once the panel is loose, you can often lift it slightly to gain access to the handle mounting screws. Take care not to damage the door components inside.

## Installing Your New Amana Microwave Handle

Now that the old handle is off, it is time to put the new one on. This step reverses the removal process. Make sure the new handle is oriented correctly before you start screwing it in. It should sit flush against the door.

Align the new handle with the mounting posts on the microwave door. The holes on the handle should line up perfectly with the screw holes on the door. Insert the screws through the new handle and into the door posts. Start tightening the screws by hand first. This ensures they catch the threads properly and do not strip.

Once all screws are in place, use your screwdriver to tighten them. Tighten them firmly but do not overtighten. Overtightening can strip the screws or crack the plastic. Make sure the handle feels secure and does not wiggle.

### Reassembling the Door Panel

If you separated the inner door panel, carefully put it back into place. Align the clips and tabs around the edge of the door. Gently press the panel back together until you hear it click into place. Work your way around the entire door frame. Make sure there are no gaps or loose sections.

Replace any plastic plugs or screw covers you removed. These give the door a finished look. They also protect the screw heads. Once everything is assembled, give the door a few gentle open and close tests. Check that the new handle feels strong and that the door latches correctly.

## Troubleshooting After Handle Replacement

Sometimes, issues happen after a repair. It is good to know what to do if your Amana microwave does not work right. Most problems are simple to fix with a quick check. Do not get discouraged if something is not perfect at first.

If the handle feels loose after replacement, gently tighten the screws again. Make sure you did not miss any screw points. Check if the screws are stripped; if so, you may need slightly larger screws or a thread repair kit. If the door does not close properly, ensure the inner panel is fully seated. Sometimes, a misaligned panel prevents the door from latching correctly.

If the microwave does not turn on after you plug it in, check the power outlet. Ensure the breaker has not tripped. If the door latches but the microwave does not start, the door interlock switches might be the problem. A handle replacement should not affect these, but it is worth checking if the door is fully closed. Sometimes, general issues can arise, similar to when replacing parts like an oven door handle, which might need a careful re-evaluation of all connections.

## Extend Your Amana Handle's Lifespan

You can help your new Amana microwave handle last a long time. Proper use and care prevent future breaks. A little attention goes a long way. This keeps your microwave working well for years.

First, use gentle force when opening and closing the door. Do not yank the handle hard. A slow, steady pull is best. Teach everyone in your home to do the same. This reduces stress on the handle's mounting points.

Second, keep the handle clean. Food residue or grease can make the handle sticky. This might tempt you to pull harder, which strains the handle. Wipe it down regularly with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid harsh cleaners that can damage the plastic.

Third, check the handle's screws occasionally. Over time, normal use can cause screws to loosen. If you notice any wobbling, tighten them right away. This simple check can prevent the handle from breaking off completely. Regular maintenance extends the life of all your appliances.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: Can I use super glue to fix my Amana microwave handle?

### Q2: How long does it take to replace an Amana microwave handle?

Replacing an Amana microwave handle usually takes 30 to 60 minutes. The actual time depends on your skill level and your microwave model. Most of the time goes into carefully removing the old handle and making sure the new one fits right. Gathering tools beforehand also speeds up the process.

### Q4: Do I need a professional to replace my Amana microwave handle?

No, most people can replace an Amana microwave handle themselves. This is a common DIY repair. If you follow safety steps and have basic tools, you can do it. A professional is only needed if you are uncomfortable with the steps or if the repair is more complex.

### Q5: What if my Amana microwave door does not latch after handle replacement?

If your Amana microwave door does not latch after handle replacement, check the inner door panel. Make sure it is fully snapped back into place. A misaligned panel can block the door from closing properly. Also, inspect the handle itself to ensure it is not preventing the door from closing completely.
