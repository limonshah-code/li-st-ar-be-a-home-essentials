Your Kenmore refrigerator stops working primarily due to power supply issues, a malfunctioning compressor, dirty condenser coils, or failures within the defrost system. Fan motors, control boards, or clogged drainage lines can also prevent proper operation. Identifying the specific symptom helps pinpoint the exact problem.

### Initial Power & Thermostat Checks for Your Kenmore Refrigerator

When your Kenmore refrigerator stops working, the very first step is always to check its power source. This simple check can save you time and money. Do not overlook this basic step, even if other appliances work in the same room. A dedicated circuit often powers refrigerators.

#### Power Outlet and Circuit Breaker

First, check if the power cord is fully plugged into the wall outlet. Sometimes, it can become loose over time. Next, check your home’s electrical panel. Look for a tripped circuit breaker labeled for the kitchen or refrigerator. Flip it completely off, then back on to reset it.

You can also test the outlet with another small appliance. Plug in a lamp or a phone charger to see if the outlet provides power. If the outlet has no power, the issue lies with your home’s electrical system, not the refrigerator itself. This requires an electrician, not an appliance repair technician.

#### Temperature Settings and Controls

Your Kenmore refrigerator might not be "broken" but simply set incorrectly. Accidental changes to temperature settings can occur. Check the control panel inside your refrigerator or on the door. Ensure the thermostat is set to the correct cooling temperature. For refrigerators, this is typically between 37-40 degrees Fahrenheit (3-4 degrees Celsius).

Also, check if your refrigerator is in "Sabbath mode" or "Showroom mode." These modes stop cooling but keep lights on, sometimes by accident. Consult your Kenmore owner's manual to confirm your specific model's controls. Knowing [How to Tell Which Kenmore Refrigerator I Have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-which-kenmore-refrigerator-i-have) can help you find the correct manual quickly online. Resetting these modes often restores normal operation.

Finally, confirm any vacation settings are off. Some Kenmore models have a vacation mode that reduces cooling to save energy while you are away. If activated, it will need to be turned off. This simple review of settings can prevent an unnecessary service call. A little check now can prevent a lot of frustration later.

### The Heart of Cooling: Kenmore Refrigerator Compressor Issues

The compressor is a crucial part of your Kenmore refrigerator's cooling system. It pumps refrigerant through the coils, making your fridge cold. If the compressor fails, your refrigerator will stop cooling. This is a common reason for a fridge to stop working entirely.

#### Compressor Function and Signs of Failure

A working compressor usually makes a low hum. If you hear no sound at all, or a clicking sound followed by silence, the compressor might be the problem. A clicking sound often indicates the start relay attempting to kick-start the compressor, but failing. When the compressor fails, the refrigerator simply will not cool.

Feel the compressor at the back of the refrigerator. It should be warm to the touch when running. If it is hot and humming loudly, but no cooling occurs, it could be overheating or stuck. This requires a professional diagnosis. A common issue among various brands, [Why Did My LG Refrigerator Stop Working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-did-my-lg-refrigerator-stop-working) also often traces back to compressor failures, illustrating the universal nature of this component's importance.

#### Start Relay and Start Capacitor

The start relay provides a jolt of electricity to get the compressor running. If it is faulty, the compressor may not start. You can often find the start relay attached to the compressor itself. A common symptom of a bad start relay is a series of clicking noises coming from the back of the fridge. This clicking often happens every few minutes.

A faulty start capacitor can also prevent the compressor from starting. The capacitor stores energy and releases it to help the compressor begin its cycle. These components are relatively inexpensive but require careful handling due to electrical charge. Testing these parts usually involves a multimeter. If these parts are bad, the compressor will not function.

Replacing these components is an electrical task. If you are not comfortable with electrical repairs, it is best to call a qualified appliance technician. They have the right tools and knowledge to safely test and replace these parts. Do not attempt this repair yourself unless you have electrical repair experience.

### Condenser Coils and Fan: Keeping Your Kenmore Refrigerator Cool

The condenser coils and fan work together to release heat from your Kenmore refrigerator. If these components are dirty or faulty, your fridge cannot cool properly. This can lead to your Kenmore refrigerator completely stopping its cooling function. Maintaining these parts is vital for efficiency.

#### Dirty Condenser Coils

Over time, dust, pet hair, and debris accumulate on the condenser coils. These coils are usually located at the back or underneath your Kenmore refrigerator. When they are covered in grime, they cannot dissipate heat effectively. This makes the compressor work harder, leading to overheating and potential shutdown.

Inspect your condenser coils. If they look dusty or dirty, clean them carefully. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment or a coil brush. Make sure to unplug the refrigerator first for safety. Regular cleaning, every 6-12 months, can prevent many cooling problems. This simple maintenance step improves efficiency and prevents breakdowns.

#### Condenser Fan Motor

The condenser fan motor pulls air over the condenser coils to cool them down. If this fan is not working, the coils will overheat, causing the compressor to shut off or run inefficiently. Listen for the fan running when the compressor is operating. You should hear a gentle hum or whirring sound.

If the fan is silent or makes unusual noises (like buzzing or grinding), it may be failing. Check for obstructions around the fan blades, such as debris or wires. Sometimes, a simple blockage is the cause. If the fan blades are clear and the motor is still not running, the motor itself likely needs replacement. Replacing the condenser fan motor requires basic tools and electrical knowledge.

This is a common issue for many refrigerators that are not cooling. Addressing dirty coils and a faulty condenser fan helps your Kenmore refrigerator release heat effectively. Proper heat dissipation is essential for maintaining cold temperatures inside. This allows the compressor to function optimally and prevents it from overheating and failing.

### Addressing Defrost System Failures in Your Kenmore Refrigerator

The defrost system prevents ice buildup on the evaporator coils inside your Kenmore freezer. If this system fails, ice can accumulate. This ice blocks airflow over the coils. When airflow stops, the refrigerator side of your Kenmore unit will stop cooling, even if the freezer still seems somewhat cold. This is a very common cause of a refrigerator appearing to "stop working."

#### Defrost Heater and Thermostat

The defrost heater melts ice from the evaporator coils periodically. If the defrost heater is faulty, ice builds up. You can often see a thick layer of frost on the back wall of the freezer compartment. This ice prevents cold air from circulating into the fresh food section.

The defrost thermostat monitors the temperature of the evaporator coils. It signals the defrost heater to turn on when ice needs melting. If the thermostat fails, it might not activate the heater. This also leads to excessive ice formation. A simple test with a multimeter can determine if these components have continuity. If they do not, they need replacement. This type of issue often explains [Why is My Kenmore Refrigerator Not Cold Enough](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-refrigerator-not-cold-enough), as ice acts as an insulator.

#### Defrost Timer or Control Board

The defrost timer controls the defrost cycle. It typically turns on the defrost heater for a short period every 8-10 hours. If the timer is faulty, it may not initiate the defrost cycle at all. This results in continuous ice buildup. Sometimes, you can manually advance the timer to see if the defrost heater activates.

Modern Kenmore refrigerators use an adaptive defrost control board instead of a mechanical timer. This electronic board monitors usage patterns and activates defrost cycles as needed. If this board malfunctions, it can fail to initiate defrost cycles. Testing a control board is complex and often requires professional diagnosis. A common symptom is the freezer getting very icy while the fridge warms up. This is a strong indicator of a defrost system problem.

Fixing a defrost system requires accessing the freezer's back panel. This involves removing shelves and drawers. Be prepared to deal with ice buildup if you attempt this repair yourself. Many homeowners prefer to call a technician for defrost system repairs.

### Evaporator Fan Motor: Circulating Cold Air in Your Kenmore Fridge

The evaporator fan motor plays a critical role in your Kenmore refrigerator's cooling. It circulates cold air from the freezer section into the fresh food compartment. If this fan stops working, the refrigerator will not cool, even if the freezer still feels cold. This is because cold air cannot reach the fridge section.

#### Function and Signs of Failure

The evaporator fan is located inside the freezer, behind the back panel. When it works correctly, you should hear a quiet hum from inside the freezer. If you open the freezer door and do not hear the fan running, or if it makes a loud grinding or squealing noise, it likely has a problem. Sometimes, ice buildup can obstruct the fan blades.

If the fan blades are blocked by ice, the fan cannot spin. This prevents cold air from circulating. You can try manually defrosting the freezer to see if the fan starts working afterward. Unplug the refrigerator for 24-48 hours with the doors open. Place towels to catch melting ice. After a full defrost, plug it back in. If the fan starts, the issue might be with the defrost system, not the fan motor itself.

#### Diagnosing and Replacing the Evaporator Fan

To properly diagnose the evaporator fan motor, you will need to access it. This involves emptying the freezer and removing the back panel inside. Once exposed, check if the blades spin freely. If they are obstructed, clear any ice or debris. If the blades spin freely but the motor does not run, the motor is likely faulty.

Replacing an evaporator fan motor is a common repair. It involves disconnecting wires and unscrewing the old motor. Then, you simply install the new motor and reconnect the wiring. Always ensure the refrigerator is unplugged before attempting any repair. While straightforward, if you are unsure, it is wise to consult a repair guide specific to your Kenmore model or call a professional. A functioning evaporator fan is essential for your Kenmore refrigerator to cool both compartments.

### Drainage System Clogs and Their Impact on Kenmore Refrigerator Performance

A less obvious but common reason for your Kenmore refrigerator to stop cooling, or to have other issues, is a clogged drainage system. When the defrost cycle melts ice, the water needs a clear path to drain away. If this path is blocked, it can cause various problems.

#### Why Your Drain Line Clogs

The defrost drain tube carries melted ice water from the freezer to the drain pan underneath the refrigerator. This tube can become clogged with food particles, debris, or ice. Over time, mold and mildew can also grow, creating blockages. When the drain line is clogged, water cannot escape.

This backed-up water can freeze again in the freezer compartment. This causes a layer of ice at the bottom of the freezer. This ice buildup can then block the evaporator fan or air vents. If the air vents are blocked, cold air cannot circulate into the fresh food compartment. You might also notice water leaking from the bottom of your refrigerator or inside the fridge compartment. This indicates a severe clog.

#### Clearing the Drain

Clearing a clogged drain line is a relatively simple DIY repair. First, unplug your Kenmore refrigerator. You will need to access the drain hole, which is usually at the back of the freezer compartment, beneath the evaporator coils. You might need to remove a few panels to reach it. Use a turkey baster or a syringe with warm water to flush the drain hole. You can also use a small, flexible brush or a straightened coat hanger to gently push through any blockages.

Once you have flushed the drain, also check the drain pan underneath the refrigerator. This pan collects the water evaporated by the compressor's heat. Clean out any stagnant water, mold, or debris from the pan. Ensure the pan is properly positioned to catch future condensate. Regular cleaning of the drain pan and periodic flushing of the drain line can prevent future clogs. This helps maintain proper cooling and prevents water leaks.

### Understanding Control Board and Electrical Problems in Kenmore Refrigerators

The control board acts as the "brain" of your Kenmore refrigerator. It sends signals to various components, telling them when to turn on and off. If this board malfunctions, it can cause your refrigerator to stop working entirely or behave erratically. Electrical problems, beyond just power supply, can also be the culprit.

#### Main Control Board Malfunctions

Modern Kenmore refrigerators rely heavily on electronic control boards. These boards manage the compressor, fans, defrost cycles, and temperature sensors. A power surge, aging components, or manufacturing defects can cause the control board to fail. Symptoms of a bad control board can vary widely. Your refrigerator might not start at all, or it might run constantly, or it might just stop cooling randomly. Sometimes, specific components like the fans or compressor may not receive power from the board.

Diagnosing a faulty control board is difficult for the average homeowner. It often requires specialized testing equipment and knowledge of electronics. There are usually no visible signs of damage to the board itself. If you have ruled out other common issues, a control board might be the problem. Replacement can be expensive.

#### Temperature Sensors and Wiring Issues

Temperature sensors, also known as thermistors, monitor the temperature inside your Kenmore refrigerator and freezer. They send data to the control board. If a sensor fails, the control board receives incorrect temperature readings. This can cause the refrigerator to cool too much, not enough, or stop cooling altogether. The board might believe the fridge is cold enough when it is not, so it stops the compressor.

Wiring issues can also disrupt the power supply to specific components. Loose connections, frayed wires, or damaged insulation can prevent parts like the compressor or fan from receiving power. This can happen due to vibrations or wear and tear over time. Always inspect visible wiring for any signs of damage. Any electrical repair should be done with the refrigerator unplugged. If you suspect an electrical issue beyond a simple loose plug, it is best to contact a certified technician. Electrical problems can be dangerous if not handled correctly.

### Common Issues Beyond Cooling: Water & Ice in Kenmore Refrigerators

While this article focuses on a Kenmore refrigerator that has "stopped working" in terms of cooling, sometimes users mean other core functionalities are disrupted. Water dispensers and ice makers are common points of failure. These issues typically do not affect the main cooling, but they can make the overall appliance feel "broken."

#### Water Dispenser Problems

If your Kenmore refrigerator dispenses no water, or only a trickle, several issues could be at play. The water supply line might be kinked or frozen. Check the line that runs from your home's water supply to the refrigerator. Ensure it is not bent or blocked by ice inside the freezer compartment. A common problem is a faulty water inlet valve. This valve opens to allow water into the dispenser and ice maker. If it is defective, water will not flow.

The water filter is another frequent culprit. A clogged or old water filter restricts water flow significantly. Most Kenmore refrigerators have a filter that needs replacement every six months. Try replacing the filter first if you notice water flow issues. Additionally, the dispenser switch or control board might be failing, preventing the dispenser from activating. Many issues with water dispensing are not unique to Kenmore. For example, troubleshooting steps for a [Whirlpool Refrigerator Stop Dispensing Water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-did-my-whirlpool-refrigerator-stop-dispensing-water) are often very similar.

#### Ice Maker Malfunctions

When your Kenmore refrigerator stops making ice, it can be due to a few reasons. A common cause is a frozen fill tube. This tube brings water into the ice maker mold. If it freezes, water cannot enter. You might need to thaw it carefully. The ice maker's motor or module itself could be faulty. The module controls the ice-making process. If it breaks, the unit will not produce ice.

Another possibility is a malfunctioning water inlet valve, similar to dispenser issues. It supplies water to both the dispenser and the ice maker. If it is closed or defective, neither will work. The ice level sensor or arm might also be stuck, telling the ice maker that the bin is full when it is not. This prevents new ice production. Just as with other brands, understanding why a [GE Refrigerator Stops Making Ice](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-did-my-ge-refrigerator-stop-making-ice) often involves checking these same components. These issues do not usually impact the core cooling function of the refrigerator but definitely impact user convenience.

### Professional Repair or Replacement: When to Call for Your Kenmore Refrigerator

After performing basic troubleshooting, you might still find your Kenmore refrigerator stopped working. At this point, you face a choice: attempt a more complex DIY repair or call a professional. Knowing when to seek expert help is important. This can save you money, time, and potential safety risks.

#### Signs to Call a Technician

If you have checked the power, cleaned the coils, and still have no cooling, it is time for a professional. Issues like a faulty compressor, a damaged main control board, or a sealed system leak require expert attention. These repairs involve specialized tools, refrigerants, and electrical knowledge. Attempting them without proper training can be dangerous and void warranties. If your Kenmore refrigerator makes strange noises (loud banging, grinding), or emits a burning smell, unplug it immediately and call a technician. These are signs of serious internal problems.

Consider the age of your Kenmore refrigerator. Most refrigerators last between 10-15 years. If your unit is older than 10 years and facing a major component failure (like a compressor), a
