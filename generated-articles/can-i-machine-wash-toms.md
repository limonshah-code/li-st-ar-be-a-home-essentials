## Washing Toms: Can You Machine Wash These Shoes?

Your favorite Toms shoes go everywhere with you. They brave dusty parks, city sidewalks, and perhaps even a casual hike. Soon enough, they accumulate dirt and grime. A common question arises: "Can I machine wash Toms?" Many people wonder if their washing machine is a safe cleaning option for these comfortable, lightweight shoes. The good news is, you often can, but specific care steps are crucial. This guide explains how to machine wash Toms correctly. We cover preparing your shoes, choosing the right wash settings, and drying them properly. My goal is to help you keep your Toms looking fresh and lasting longer.

### Takeaway

*   **Protect Your Toms:** Place them in a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Use Cold Water:** Always select a cold water cycle.
*   **Gentle Cycle Only:** Choose the delicate or gentle setting.
*   **Mild Detergent:** Use a small amount of liquid, mild detergent.
*   **Air Dry Completely:** Never put Toms in a dryer; air dry only.

### Can I machine wash Toms?

Yes, you can machine wash most canvas Toms shoes, but you must do so with extreme caution. Use a cold water, gentle cycle with mild detergent. Always place them in a mesh laundry bag to protect them. Drying them properly is also very important. Avoid heat at all costs to prevent damage.

### Understanding Toms Materials and Machine Washing Risks

Toms shoes come in various styles and materials. Most classic Toms feature a canvas upper and an espadrille sole. Other types include suede, glitter, or printed fabrics. Each material reacts differently to water and agitation. Machine washing introduces risks like shrinkage, color fading, and damage to the shoe's structure. The glue holding the sole to the upper can weaken or dissolve with too much heat or harsh cycles. This understanding helps us choose the best washing approach for your specific pair.

Canvas Toms are generally the most resilient for machine washing. Their durable fabric handles gentle cycles well. However, suede Toms should never go into a washing machine. Water can permanently damage suede, causing stiffness and discoloration. Similarly, glitter or embellished Toms might lose their decorative elements during a wash. Always check the specific material of your Toms before attempting any cleaning method. Knowing the material helps you avoid mistakes.

Even with canvas, machine washing presents some risks. Excessive agitation can stretch or distort the fabric. Hot water causes colors to bleed and can shrink the shoe. The espadrille sole, often made of jute, can absorb too much water and take a long time to dry. This creates a risk of mold or mildew if not dried properly. My advice is to always prioritize the safety of your shoes. A gentle approach maintains their shape and appearance.

You must accept these risks when choosing machine washing for your Toms. The benefits of a thorough clean often outweigh the potential downsides for canvas styles. However, for more delicate materials, hand washing remains the safer choice. We want to clean our shoes, not ruin them. Understanding these potential issues helps you make an informed decision.

### Preparing Your Toms for a Washing Machine Cycle

Proper preparation is vital before you machine wash Toms. This step minimizes damage and maximizes cleaning effectiveness. I always begin by removing loose dirt from the shoes. You can use a soft brush or an old toothbrush for this task. Gently brush away any caked-on mud or debris from the canvas and sole. This prevents dirt from spreading during the wash cycle.

Next, address any visible stains. Pre-treating stains improves the final outcome. Apply a small amount of mild laundry detergent directly to the stain. Gently rub it in with your fingers or a soft cloth. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. This gives the detergent time to break down the grime. For specific guidance on removing tough stains, you can explore resources on [how to clean Toms shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-toms-shoes). This pre-treatment step is often overlooked but makes a big difference.

Consider removing insoles if your Toms have removable ones. Some Toms models feature removable insoles, while others do not. If you can remove them, wash them separately by hand or place them inside the mesh bag with the shoes. This ensures a more thorough cleaning for the inside of the shoe. If insoles are glued in, just leave them. Do not try to force them out.

My next crucial step is placing the Toms inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag acts as a protective barrier during the wash cycle. It prevents the shoes from banging against the washing machine drum. It also keeps them from snagging on other items if you are washing them with other things. I always use a sturdy mesh bag for shoes. You can often find these in the laundry aisle of stores. This simple item offers big protection.

If your Toms have any laces, remove them before placing the shoes in the bag. You can wash the laces separately by hand or put them in the mesh bag with the shoes. While many classic Toms do not have traditional laces, some newer styles do. Double-check your specific pair. These preparation steps make the machine washing process much safer for your beloved Toms.

### The Best Machine Washing Settings for Toms Shoes

Choosing the right washing machine settings is perhaps the most critical part of cleaning your Toms. Incorrect settings can cause irreversible damage. I always recommend using cold water for washing Toms. Hot water can cause the canvas to shrink, the colors to fade, and the adhesive holding the sole to weaken. Cold water is much gentler on both the fabric and the glue. It also helps prevent any dyes from running, keeping your Toms looking vibrant.

The wash cycle choice is equally important. You must select the delicate or gentle cycle on your washing machine. This setting uses minimal agitation and a slower spin speed. It mimics hand washing more closely than other cycles. A normal or heavy-duty cycle is far too harsh for Toms shoes. Such cycles can warp the shoes' shape, separate the soles, or fray the canvas. Always opt for the gentlest possible setting. For more information on general shoe washing in specific machines, you might find articles like [can you wash shoes in LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-lg-washing-machine) helpful, as they often detail gentle cycle options.

When it comes to detergent, a mild liquid laundry detergent is your best friend. Avoid using harsh powdered detergents, bleach, or fabric softeners. Powdered detergents can sometimes leave residue on the canvas. Bleach will certainly damage the fabric and cause discoloration. Fabric softeners can leave a film and are not needed for shoes. Use only a small amount of liquid detergent. Too much soap can be hard to rinse out and may leave a sticky residue.

I prefer using a detergent specifically designed for delicate items or natural fabrics. You can also opt for a small amount of mild dish soap as an alternative. Make sure the detergent does not contain strong chemicals or dyes. This minimalist approach to cleaning agents keeps your Toms safe. These precise settings are crucial for cleaning your Toms effectively without causing harm. Following these steps helps prolong the life of your favorite shoes.

### Air Drying Toms Shoes: A Crucial Step

After washing your Toms, the drying process is just as important as the wash itself. This step is where many people make mistakes. The most important rule is to never, ever put your Toms in a clothes dryer. Heat is the enemy of Toms shoes. The high temperatures in a dryer can cause several problems. It can melt the glue that holds the sole to the upper, leading to sole separation. Heat also shrinks the canvas material, making your shoes too tight or misshapen. Additionally, it can cause colors to fade or warp the overall structure of the shoe.

Always air dry your Toms. Find a well-ventilated area indoors for drying. Avoid direct sunlight, as intense sun can also fade colors and potentially cause materials to stiffen. A spot near an open window or a fan is ideal. Placing them outdoors on a porch is fine, but bring them in if rain is expected or the sun is too harsh. I often place mine on a laundry rack or hang them from a clothesline by their top edge.

To help your Toms maintain their shape as they dry, stuff them with paper towels or clean, dry rags. This absorbs excess moisture from the inside and helps prevent the shoes from collapsing or wrinkling. Change the paper towels every few hours if they become very damp. This speeds up the drying process. Make sure the paper you use is plain and unprinted to avoid ink transfer to your shoes.

Drying Toms takes time, sometimes up to 24-48 hours. The exact time depends on the humidity levels in your environment and how saturated the shoes became during washing. Be patient and allow them to dry completely before wearing them again. Wearing damp Toms can lead to odors or mildew growth. I usually check them periodically, giving them a gentle squeeze to feel for any remaining dampness. Full air drying ensures your Toms return to their comfortable, well-fitting state.

### Hand Washing Toms: A Safer Alternative for Delicate Styles

While machine washing works for many canvas Toms, some styles simply require a gentler touch. Hand washing is often the safest and best alternative, especially for delicate materials like suede, glitter-covered Toms, or those with intricate embellishments. Hand washing gives you complete control over the cleaning process. This helps prevent damage that a machine might cause. It ensures longevity for your special pairs.

For suede Toms, machine washing is a definite no-go. Water can ruin suede, making it stiff, discolored, and brittle. Instead, you should spot clean suede shoes. Use a soft brush designed for suede to remove loose dirt. For stains, apply a small amount of suede cleaner to a clean cloth. Gently blot the stained area. Do not rub vigorously, as this can damage the nap of the suede. Let it air dry away from heat.

Glitter or embellished Toms also fare better with hand washing. The agitation of a washing machine can cause glitter to flake off or delicate beads to detach. For these, I recommend using a damp cloth with a tiny bit of mild soap. Gently wipe the canvas areas. Be very careful around the glitter or embellishments. You want to clean the dirt without disturbing the decorative elements. Rinse the cloth often to avoid spreading dirt.

For canvas Toms that you prefer not to machine wash, hand washing is straightforward. Fill a basin with cool water and add a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Submerge the shoes. Use a soft brush or cloth to gently scrub the canvas, focusing on dirty areas. You can pay special attention to the espadrille sole if it needs cleaning. After scrubbing, rinse the shoes thoroughly under cool running water until all soap residue is gone. For a comprehensive look at various cleaning methods for your shoes, our guide on [how to clean Toms shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-toms-shoes) offers more detailed insights.

Once clean, gently squeeze out excess water. Do not twist or wring the shoes. Then, follow the same air-drying steps as described for machine-washed Toms. Stuff them with paper towels and let them dry completely in a well-ventilated area. Hand washing ensures your delicate Toms remain in excellent condition. It is a little more work, but it saves your shoes from potential harm.

### Maintaining Clean Toms Between Washes

Keeping your Toms clean between deep washes extends their life and keeps them looking good. Regular care prevents dirt buildup and reduces the need for frequent full washes. Frequent washing, even gentle machine washing, can still put stress on the shoes over time. A few simple habits can make a big difference. I try to incorporate these into my routine.

First, practice regular spot cleaning. If you notice a small dirt mark or a fresh spill, address it immediately. Use a damp cloth or a soft brush to gently wipe or brush off the dirt. A small amount of mild soap can help with tougher spots. This prevents stains from setting in. Quick action saves your shoes from becoming heavily soiled. It is much easier to clean a small spot than an entire shoe.

Consider using shoe deodorizers. Toms, like any shoes worn without socks, can develop odors. Sprinkling a little baking soda inside them overnight can absorb smells. You can also use commercial shoe deodorizer sprays or cedar inserts. This keeps your Toms smelling fresh. A fresh smell also makes your shoes more pleasant to wear.

Proper storage is another key to maintenance. When you are not wearing your Toms, store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or in humid areas. This helps prevent mold or mildew growth. Keeping them in a shoe bag or box can also protect them from dust and dirt accumulation. I sometimes keep mine in their original box.

Applying a fabric protector spray can also be beneficial for canvas Toms. These sprays create a barrier on the fabric. This helps repel water and stains. You typically spray them on clean, dry shoes. Always follow the product's instructions. A protective layer makes it harder for dirt to stick to the canvas. This means less cleaning work for you down the line.

Finally, consider rotating your shoes. If you wear Toms every day, owning more than one pair allows you to alternate. This gives each pair time to air out and recover. It also reduces the wear and tear on any single pair. These simple maintenance tips help keep your Toms looking good and smelling fresh for longer. They extend the time between washes significantly.
