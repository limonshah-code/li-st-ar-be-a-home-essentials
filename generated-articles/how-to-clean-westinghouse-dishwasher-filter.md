## Clean Your Westinghouse Dishwasher Filter for Peak Performance

A clean dishwasher is a happy dishwasher. If your dishes are not coming out sparkling, or if you notice strange odors, a dirty filter might be the problem. Many people overlook this important component. Learning how to clean Westinghouse dishwasher filter ensures your appliance runs well.

I know the frustration of opening a dishwasher only to find dirty dishes. This usually points to a clogged filter. Cleaning your Westinghouse dishwasher filter is a simple task. It dramatically improves washing performance and extends your appliance's life. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. We will cover why filter cleaning matters, how to find your filter, and the exact steps to clean and reinstall it. You will find everything you need to keep your Westinghouse dishwasher in top shape.

### Takeaway: Keep Your Dishwasher Running Smoothly
*   Regularly clean your Westinghouse dishwasher filter.
*   Remove debris from the filter to prevent clogs.
*   Rinse and scrub the filter under warm water.
*   Reinstall the filter correctly after cleaning.
*   A clean filter ensures sparkling dishes and prevents odors.

To clean your Westinghouse dishwasher filter, first locate it at the bottom of the wash tub. Twist or unlock the filter assembly, then lift it out. Rinse the components under warm running water to remove food particles and grease. Use a soft brush for stubborn debris, then reinstall it securely.

### Why Cleaning Your Westinghouse Dishwasher Filter Matters

A dishwasher filter works hard to catch food particles and debris. This prevents them from recirculating onto your dishes during the wash cycle. Over time, these particles build up. This can lead to various problems with your Westinghouse dishwasher's performance. Neglecting the filter is a common mistake that affects many homeowners.

A clogged filter restricts water flow. Your dishes may not get enough clean water. This results in spots, residue, or even chunks of food left on your plates. Dirty filters also trap moisture and old food. This creates an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and mold. You will start to notice unpleasant smells coming from your dishwasher. These odors can transfer to your clean dishes.

Think of the filter as your dishwasher's kidney. It removes impurities from the water. If the kidney gets blocked, the whole system suffers. A clean filter allows water to drain properly. It also helps your dishwasher operate more efficiently. You might even save on utility bills because the appliance does not have to work as hard. Regularly cleaning this part is a simple but powerful maintenance step. It ensures sparkling clean dishes every time. It also keeps your appliance smelling fresh. This routine helps your Westinghouse dishwasher last longer.

You can also learn more about the importance of filter cleaning and general maintenance for any dishwasher by checking our guide on [how often should you clean your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-your-dishwasher-filter). This guide explains common issues from dirty filters. It reinforces the need for regular cleaning. Keeping up with this simple task protects your appliance. It also protects your investment in a high-performing kitchen appliance.

### Identifying Your Westinghouse Dishwasher Filter Type

Before cleaning, you need to know where your Westinghouse dishwasher filter is located. You also need to know its type. Most Westinghouse dishwashers use a manual filter system. This means you need to remove and clean the filter yourself. Some older or simpler models might have a self-cleaning filter. These filters use a food grinder to break down particles.

Most Westinghouse dishwashers have a two-part filter system. This system sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You will usually find it under the lower spray arm. The filter often consists of a cylindrical or cup-shaped coarse filter. It has a flat, fine mesh screen that surrounds it. You may need to remove the lower spray arm to access the filter easily.

To locate your filter, open the dishwasher door. Look at the very bottom of the tub. You will see a circular or rectangular component. It is usually made of plastic or metal mesh. This is your filter assembly. For many Westinghouse models, the coarse filter twists to unlock. The fine mesh screen might just lift out. If you are unsure, consult your Westinghouse dishwasher's user manual. The manual provides specific diagrams and instructions for your model. Knowing the exact design of your filter makes removal and reinstallation much simpler. It helps you avoid any accidental damage.

Understanding how to find your specific dishwasher filter is important for starting the cleaning process. We have a detailed guide on [how to find your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-your-dishwasher-filter) that provides general steps useful for most models, including Westinghouse ones. This resource can help you pinpoint the exact location. It shows you what to look for before you start disassembling anything. This knowledge saves you time and ensures a smooth cleaning experience.

### Essential Tools and Supplies for Cleaning

Cleaning your Westinghouse dishwasher filter does not require many special tools. Most of the items you need are probably already in your kitchen or utility closet. Gathering these supplies beforehand makes the cleaning process quick and efficient. I always like to have everything ready before I start a task.

Here is a list of the essential tools and supplies you will need:
*   **Rubber Gloves:** These protect your hands from grime. They also protect them from any residual cleaning agents in the dishwasher.
*   **Soft Brush:** A small, soft-bristled brush is ideal. An old toothbrush works perfectly. This helps scrub away stubborn food particles. It reaches into the mesh without damaging the filter material.
*   **Mild Dish Soap:** A few drops of regular dish soap are enough. This helps cut through grease and grime on the filter. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. These can damage the filter or leave residues inside the dishwasher.
*   **Warm Running Water:** You will use water to rinse the filter thoroughly. A kitchen sink with a sprayer attachment is very helpful.
*   **Paper Towels or an Old Cloth:** These are useful for wiping down the filter area in the dishwasher. They also help dry the filter components after cleaning.
*   **Small Bowl or Bucket (Optional):** If your filter is very dirty, you might want to soak it. A small bowl filled with warm soapy water can be useful for this.

Having these simple items ready helps me tackle the job quickly. It ensures I clean the filter effectively without any interruptions. Proper tools make the job easy. They also make it safe for your hands and your appliance. It is a good practice to keep these items organized for future maintenance tasks.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Remove Your Westinghouse Dishwasher Filter

Removing the filter from your Westinghouse dishwasher is a straightforward process. However, you must do it carefully to avoid damage. I always make sure the dishwasher is off before I start. Safety first is important with any appliance maintenance.

Follow these steps to remove your Westinghouse dishwasher filter:

1.  **Turn Off the Dishwasher:** Before you begin, make sure the dishwasher is completely turned off. Unplug it from the power outlet. You can also flip the circuit breaker. This prevents accidental starts and ensures your safety.
2.  **Remove the Lower Dish Rack:** Pull out the lower dish rack completely. This gives you clear access to the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Set the rack aside.
3.  **Locate the Filter Assembly:** Look at the center of the dishwasher's bottom. You will see the filter assembly. It usually consists of a cylindrical filter and a flat, fine mesh screen.
4.  **Twist and Unlock the Coarse Filter:** Most Westinghouse models have a cylindrical coarse filter. This filter twists to unlock. Turn it counter-clockwise, usually about a quarter turn. You might feel a click when it unlocks.
5.  **Lift Out the Coarse Filter:** Once unlocked, carefully lift the coarse filter straight up and out of the dishwasher. It might have some trapped food debris, so be prepared for that.
6.  **Remove the Fine Mesh Filter:** After removing the coarse filter, the flat fine mesh screen should be exposed. This screen often just lifts out. Some models might require a gentle pull. Lift it carefully to avoid bending or damaging the delicate mesh.

It is important to handle both filter components gently. They can be fragile, especially the fine mesh. If you encounter resistance, do not force it. Recheck your user manual for model-specific instructions. Properly removing the filter is the first critical step towards a truly clean dishwasher. A resource like [how to get dishwasher filter out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-dishwasher-filter-out) provides general guidance on filter removal. This complements specific steps for Westinghouse models. It can help you understand common filter designs.

### How to Deep Clean Your Westinghouse Dishwasher Filter

Once you have removed your Westinghouse dishwasher filter components, it is time for the deep cleaning. This step is crucial for removing all trapped food particles, grease, and grime. A thorough cleaning ensures optimal performance. I find it satisfying to see all the gunk wash away.

Follow these steps for a deep clean:

1.  **Rinse Under Warm Running Water:** Take both the coarse filter and the fine mesh filter to your sink. Hold them under warm running water. Allow the water to flush away loose food particles. You can use a kitchen sink sprayer if you have one. This helps dislodge debris quickly.
2.  **Scrub with a Soft Brush and Mild Soap:** Apply a few drops of mild dish soap to your soft brush. Gently scrub all surfaces of both filter components. Pay close attention to the mesh screens and any crevices. Food particles and grease often cling tightly to these areas. Make sure to remove any slimy buildup. This buildup is usually grease mixed with detergent residue.
3.  **Inspect for Trapped Debris:** After scrubbing, hold the filter components up to the light. Look for any remaining food bits or debris stuck in the mesh. If you see any, continue scrubbing or try to pick them out carefully. You want the filter to be completely clear.
4.  **Soak for Stubborn Buildup (Optional):** If your filter has heavy, caked-on residue or is very greasy, you can soak it. Fill a small bowl with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Let the filter components soak for 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen stubborn grime. Then, repeat the scrubbing and rinsing steps.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly Again:** Rinse both filter components thoroughly under warm running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Soap left on the filter can cause excessive sudsing during your next wash cycle.
6.  **Clean the Filter Housing:** While the filter is out, take a moment to wipe the filter housing inside the dishwasher. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to clean away any grime or food particles in that area. This ensures a clean environment for the reinstalled filter.

A clean filter allows proper water flow and drainage. This directly impacts how clean your dishes become.

### Reinstalling Your Westinghouse Dishwasher Filter Correctly

After you have thoroughly cleaned your Westinghouse dishwasher filter, the next critical step is to reinstall it correctly. Proper reinstallation ensures the filter functions as intended. It also prevents any leaks or performance issues. I always double-check everything after putting parts back together.

Follow these steps to reinstall your Westinghouse dishwasher filter:

1.  **Insert the Fine Mesh Filter:** First, place the flat fine mesh screen back into its position at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It should sit flat and flush with the bottom surface. Ensure it aligns with any grooves or guides.
2.  **Place the Coarse Filter:** Next, position the cylindrical coarse filter over the fine mesh screen. It usually has an arrow or indicator on top. This indicator helps you align it correctly with the slot in the filter housing.
3.  **Align and Twist to Lock:** Once the coarse filter is in place, gently push it down. Then, turn it clockwise. You should feel it click into a locked position. This ensures the filter is secure and won't move during wash cycles. Some models might have a visual indicator to confirm it is locked.
4.  **Replace the Lower Dish Rack:** Slide the lower dish rack back into its position inside the dishwasher. Make sure it moves freely and is properly seated.
5.  **Restore Power:** Plug your dishwasher back into the power outlet. Or, flip the circuit breaker back on.
6.  **Perform a Test Run:** Run a short rinse cycle or an empty wash cycle. This helps you confirm that the filter is properly installed and there are no leaks. Listen for any unusual noises. Check for proper drainage.

Reinstalling the filter correctly is just as important as cleaning it. A loosely installed filter can lead to dirty dishes or even damage to the dishwasher pump. Taking a moment to ensure it is secure saves you potential problems down the line. To ensure a perfect fit every time, you can also consult our detailed guide on [how to put dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in). This general resource covers common reinstallation tips applicable to various dishwasher models.

### Maintenance Tips for a Clean Dishwasher Filter

Cleaning your Westinghouse dishwasher filter regularly is key. However, some simple maintenance habits can reduce how often you need to do a deep clean. These tips also help keep your entire dishwasher running smoothly. I incorporate these into my routine.

Here are some helpful maintenance tips:

*   **Scrape Plates Before Loading:** Encourage everyone in your household to scrape large food particles off plates before loading them into the dishwasher. You do not need to pre-rinse every dish. However, removing big pieces of food, like bones, seeds, or large crumbs, prevents them from reaching the filter. This reduces the filter's workload.
*   **Run a Hot Cycle Regularly:** Hot water helps break down grease and detergent residue. Running your dishwasher on a hot cycle, especially with a dishwasher cleaner, can help keep the filter and internal components cleaner.
*   **Use the Right Amount of Detergent:** Using too much detergent can lead to excessive suds. This leaves a residue that can clog the filter. Using too little means food might not wash away properly. Always follow the detergent manufacturer's recommendations.
*   **Check the Filter Monthly:** Even with good scraping habits, check your filter at least once a month. This quick visual inspection helps you catch buildup early. Cleaning a slightly dirty filter is much easier than cleaning a heavily clogged one. If you use your dishwasher daily, consider checking it more often.
*   **Clean the Spray Arms:** While cleaning the filter, also check the spray arms. Food particles can clog the small holes in the spray arms. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear any blockages. Clean spray arms mean water sprays effectively. This helps wash away food before it reaches the filter.
*   **Use Rinse Aid:** Rinse aid helps water sheet off dishes. This promotes better drying and reduces water spots. It also helps prevent food particles from clinging to the dishes. This means fewer particles going to the filter. For more insights on how it benefits your Westinghouse appliance, read our guide on [how to use rinse aid in Westinghouse dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-rinse-aid-in-westinghouse-dishwasher).

These simple habits will extend the life of your Westinghouse dishwasher filter. They also improve your dishwasher's overall cleaning performance. A little proactive care goes a long way.

### Common Dishwasher Filter Problems and Solutions

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter specific issues related to your Westinghouse dishwasher filter. Knowing how to diagnose and address these common problems can save you frustration. I have run into a few of these myself.

Here are some common filter problems and their solutions:

*   **Filter Clogs Quickly:** If your filter becomes clogged very fast, it usually means too much food debris enters the dishwasher.
    *   **Solution:** Reinforce the habit of scraping plates thoroughly before loading. Consider a quicker, more frequent rinse of the filter.
*   **Persistent Odors Despite Cleaning:** You cleaned the filter, but the bad smell remains. The odor might come from other parts of the dishwasher.
    *   **Solution:** Clean the spray arms, door gasket, and interior walls. Run an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or a cup of white vinegar.
*   **Dishes Still Dirty After Filter Cleaning:** If your dishes are still not clean, the problem might not be just the filter.
    *   **Solution:** Check the spray arms for clogs. Ensure the water temperature is hot enough. Make sure you are using the correct amount and type of detergent. Check that the rinse aid dispenser is full.
*   **Water Not Draining Completely:** If water pools at the bottom of the tub, a blocked filter might be a cause. However, other issues can also cause this.
    *   **Solution:** First, re-clean the filter and ensure it is installed correctly. If the problem persists, check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. The drain pump might also have an issue. A resource discussing [why is my dishwasher filter full of water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-dishwasher-filter-full-of-water) can provide further troubleshooting steps.
*   **Difficulty Removing or Reinstalling Filter:** Sometimes the filter can be stiff or tricky to remove.
    *   **Solution:** Refer to your Westinghouse user manual for exact instructions. Sometimes a slight twist or push in a specific direction is needed. If it is stuck due to buildup, a pre-soak with warm soapy water might help loosen it before removal.

Addressing these issues promptly helps maintain your dishwasher's efficiency. It keeps your dishes clean. Knowing these solutions helps you deal with common filter-related concerns.

### FAQ Section

#### How often should I clean my Westinghouse dishwasher filter?
You should clean your Westinghouse dishwasher filter at least once a month. If you use your dishwasher daily or frequently wash dishes with heavy food residue, consider cleaning it every two weeks. Regular checks help prevent clogs and odors. This also keeps your dishwasher performing at its best.

#### What happens if I don't clean my dishwasher filter?
If you do not clean your dishwasher filter, food particles and grease will build up. This buildup can lead to poor wash performance, leaving dishes dirty or spotted. It also causes unpleasant odors to develop inside the dishwasher. A clogged filter can strain the dishwasher's pump. This may lead to costly repairs over time.

#### Can I put my dishwasher filter in the dishwasher to clean it?
No, you should not put your dishwasher filter in the dishwasher to clean it. The dishwasher's cycles are designed for dishes, not for cleaning its own filter. Placing it inside will not effectively remove trapped food debris and grease. Always clean the filter manually under warm running water with a soft brush and mild dish soap.

#### What if my Westinghouse dishwasher filter is still dirty after cleaning?
If your Westinghouse dishwasher filter remains dirty after cleaning, it might have very stubborn, caked-on buildup. Try soaking the filter components in warm, soapy water for 15-30 minutes. Use a slightly firmer (but still soft) brush to scrub again after soaking. Ensure you rinse all crevices thoroughly.

#### Why is my Westinghouse dishwasher filter full of water?
If your Westinghouse dishwasher filter is full of water, it usually indicates a drainage problem. The filter itself might be so clogged that it obstructs water flow. Other causes include a blocked drain hose, a malfunctioning drain pump, or issues with the air gap (if installed). Clean the filter thoroughly first. Then, check the drain hose for kinks or blockages.

#### Are Westinghouse dishwasher filters universal?
No, Westinghouse dishwasher filters are not universal. Different models and series of Westinghouse dishwashers may use different filter designs and sizes. Always refer to your specific dishwasher's user manual for the correct filter type. If you need a replacement, ensure you get one compatible with your model number.
