### What is a Dishwasher Diverter Motor?

A dishwasher diverter motor is a component that controls the direction of water flow to the spray arms inside your appliance. It ensures water pressure is distributed effectively to either the upper or lower spray arms at different points in the wash cycle. This controlled water delivery makes sure all your dishes receive a thorough cleaning.

## What a Dishwasher Diverter Motor Does for Your Dishes

Every time you load your dishwasher, you expect sparkling clean results. The **dishwasher diverter motor** is a key player in achieving this goal. Its primary job is to manage how water moves through your appliance during a wash cycle. Think of it as a traffic controller for water inside the dishwasher. It makes sure water goes exactly where it needs to go.

The diverter motor works with the main wash pump. The wash pump circulates water from the sump. But the diverter motor decides *where* that water goes next. Some dishwashers have multiple spray arms, like an upper arm and a lower arm. The diverter motor switches the water flow between these arms. This ensures that both the top rack and the bottom rack of dishes get equal cleaning attention. Without this precise direction, some dishes might end up dirty.

Imagine if water only sprayed the bottom rack. Your top rack items would stay dirty. Or what if water only went to the top? The bottom items would not get clean. The diverter motor prevents these scenarios. It cycles the water pressure, allowing each spray arm to operate at its full potential. This focused water delivery helps remove food particles from all dish surfaces. It improves cleaning efficiency and gives you the best wash results possible.

## How the Dishwasher Diverter Motor Works

Understanding how your **dishwasher diverter motor** works helps you appreciate its engineering. This motor is a small electric device. It connects to a diverter valve or disc within the dishwasher's water circulation system. When the dishwasher starts a wash cycle, the main control board sends a signal to the diverter motor. This signal tells the motor to move.

The motor then rotates a cam or disc to open and close specific water pathways. For instance, during one part of the cycle, the diverter motor might direct all the water pressure to the lower spray arm. This focuses on heavily soiled pots and pans on the bottom rack. Then, at another point, the motor shifts. It redirects water flow to the upper spray arm. This ensures that glasses and smaller items on the top rack also receive a powerful spray.

This switching happens several times throughout a wash cycle. The timing is precise. It ensures balanced cleaning across both racks. The diverter motor uses a gear mechanism to move the diverter valve slowly and accurately. This controlled movement prevents sudden pressure changes. It also makes sure the system operates smoothly. You might hear a slight hum or click when the diverter motor changes position. This is a normal sound of it doing its job. This continuous redirection is essential for a thorough and even wash.

## Signs of a Failing Dishwasher Diverter Motor

Recognizing the signs of a failing **dishwasher diverter motor** can save you from bigger problems. When this motor starts to struggle, your dishwasher's performance often drops. The most common symptom is poor cleaning. If your dishes, especially those on one rack, consistently come out dirty, the diverter motor might be the cause. For example, if the top rack is always dirty, the motor may not be sending water to the upper spray arm.

Another common sign is unusual noises coming from your dishwasher. A failing diverter motor might make grinding, buzzing, or clicking sounds that are louder than usual. These noises often happen when the motor tries to switch water flow. The gears inside the motor might be worn out. Or the motor itself could be seizing up. You might also notice that the spray arms do not spin as forcefully as they should. This reduced water pressure affects how well your dishes get clean.

Sometimes, the dishwasher might stop mid-cycle or display an error code related to water distribution. This indicates the control board is not getting proper feedback from the diverter motor. If you observe any of these issues, it is a good idea to investigate the diverter motor. Catching these problems early can prevent further damage to your appliance. You can learn how to [test a dishwasher motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-dishwasher-motor) to see if it is working correctly.

## Common Causes of Diverter Motor Issues

Several factors can lead to problems with your **dishwasher diverter motor**. Understanding these causes helps in both troubleshooting and prevention. One major cause is simple wear and tear. Like any mechanical part with moving components, the diverter motor experiences friction and stress over time. The gears inside can wear down, or the motor windings can degrade. This is especially true for dishwashers used frequently over many years. Eventually, the motor loses its ability to turn the diverter valve effectively.

Another common issue involves blockages or obstructions. Food particles, grease, or mineral deposits can build up around the diverter valve. This prevents the motor from moving it freely. The motor then has to work harder, which can lead to overheating or premature failure. Using too much detergent or not scraping plates before loading can contribute to these blockages. Hard water, which contains high levels of minerals, also speeds up deposit formation.

Electrical problems can also affect the diverter motor. A faulty wire connection, a damaged control board, or even a power surge can cause the motor to stop working. Sometimes, the motor itself can have an internal electrical fault. This prevents it from receiving power or operating correctly. Water leaks near the motor can also damage electrical components. Regular inspection and proper dishwasher usage can help reduce these risks.

## Troubleshooting Dishwasher Diverter Motor Problems

When your dishwasher shows signs of trouble, troubleshooting the **dishwasher diverter motor** is a good next step. First, always disconnect power to your dishwasher before you begin. Safety is most important. Start by listening carefully during a wash cycle. Can you hear the motor attempting to shift? Unusual noises like grinding or buzzing often point to a mechanical issue with the motor. No sound at all might suggest an electrical problem or a completely failed motor.

Next, you can visually inspect the diverter motor area if it is accessible. For many dishwashers, you need to remove the lower spray arm and potentially the sump cover. Look for any visible obstructions around the diverter valve or the motor. Food debris or foreign objects can hinder its movement. You can also gently try to move the diverter valve by hand (if possible) to feel for resistance. If it feels stiff, there might be a blockage.

To check for electrical continuity, you might need a multimeter. Testing the motor's windings can tell you if it is receiving power or if it has an internal electrical fault. This step requires some technical knowledge. If you are not comfortable with electrical tests, it is better to call a professional.
