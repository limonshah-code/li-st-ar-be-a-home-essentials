You should [vacuum before carpet cleaning](https://homeessentialsguide.com/should-you-vacuum-before-carpet-cleaning) to remove dry soil. This step improves cleaning results. Rotary scrubbers or pile lifters help agitate stubborn dirt. They prepare the carpet for extraction. You also need various hand tools. These include spotters, brushes, and detailing tools.

### Chemical Inventory

Cleaning solutions are an ongoing expense. You need a range of chemicals for different carpet types and stains. Pre-sprays break down dirt. Detergents do the main cleaning.
