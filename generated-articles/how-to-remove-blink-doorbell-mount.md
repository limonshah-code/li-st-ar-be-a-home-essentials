## Removing Your Blink Doorbell Mount: A Step-by-Step Guide

Perhaps you are moving to a new home. Maybe you want to upgrade your smart doorbell. You might just need to repaint your front door area. Knowing how to remove your Blink Doorbell mount correctly is important. This guide will help you through each step. We will cover the tools you need and safety measures. You will learn to remove the mount without damaging your wall or the doorbell itself.

### Takeaway

Removing a Blink Doorbell mount requires careful steps. You will need to disconnect the doorbell unit first. Then you can tackle the mount. Different mounts need different methods.
*   **Wired doorbells:** Disconnect power at the breaker.
*   **Wireless doorbells:** Remove batteries.
*   **Screwed mounts:** Unscrew the mount from the wall.
*   **Adhesive mounts:** Use heat or a thin tool to loosen.
*   Always repair the wall surface after removal.

### How do you remove a Blink doorbell mount?

You remove a Blink doorbell mount by first detaching the doorbell unit from its base. If wired, disconnect power. Then, use a screwdriver for screwed mounts or gentle prying and heat for adhesive mounts. Finally, clean the area and repair any wall damage.

## Why You Might Need to Remove Your Blink Doorbell Mount

There are many reasons to remove your Blink Doorbell mount. Understanding these reasons helps you plan your actions. I often find myself needing to adjust things around the house. A doorbell mount is no different.

First, you might be moving. When you sell a house, you may want to take your smart home devices with you. This includes your Blink doorbell. It is an investment, and you should bring it to your new place. Removing the mount correctly ensures it remains usable.

Second, an upgrade might be on your mind. Technology changes quickly. A newer Blink doorbell model might offer better features. You will need to remove the old mount to install the new one. This ensures a clean installation for the new device.

Third, repairs or maintenance can be a reason. The doorbell or the surrounding wall might need work. Perhaps you are painting your front door frame. You need to take the mount off for a clean paint job. Sometimes, the mount itself gets damaged. You might need to replace it.

Finally, battery changes are common for wireless models. While you typically remove the doorbell unit itself for battery access, sometimes the mount needs adjustment or cleaning behind it. If your doorbell is wired, you might also need to access wiring connections behind the mount.

## Essential Tools and Safety Precautions for Doorbell Removal

Before you start, gather all necessary tools. Safety is also very important. I always prepare my workspace before any DIY project. This helps the job go smoothly and safely.

You will need a few basic hand tools. A small Phillips head screwdriver is a must. A flathead screwdriver might also be useful for prying. If your doorbell is high up, a stable step ladder is important. Make sure it is sturdy and on level ground.

For safety, think about power. If your Blink doorbell is wired, you must turn off the power. Go to your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker that controls your doorbell or the entire outdoor circuit. Flip it to the OFF position. Use a non-contact voltage tester to confirm the power is off. This step prevents electric shock. Knowing if your [Blink doorbell can be wired for power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-blink-doorbell-be-wired-for-power) helps with this safety check.

Consider eye protection. Small pieces of debris can fly when working with walls. Safety glasses protect your eyes. Wear gloves if you prefer. They offer a better grip and protect your hands. Having a small container for screws is also helpful. This prevents losing small parts during the removal process.

## Disconnecting Your Blink Doorbell Unit from its Mount

The first step in removing the mount is to take off the doorbell unit itself. This step is the same for most Blink doorbell models. It separates the sensitive electronics from the mounting hardware. I always start with the easiest part of a project.

First, check your doorbell model. Most Blink doorbells snap onto their mounts. Look for a small release tab or button. It is usually at the bottom of the doorbell unit. You might need a special tool, often a small key or pin that came with your doorbell. Insert this tool into the small hole. Push firmly. The doorbell unit should then tilt or slide upwards off the mount.

Once the doorbell unit is free, you need to address its power source. If your Blink doorbell uses batteries, simply remove them. Open the battery compartment. Take out the old batteries. Knowing if you can use [rechargeable batteries in your Blink doorbell](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-blink-doorbell-use-rechargeable-batteries) is good for future use.

If your Blink doorbell is wired, you will see two small wires connected to the back. These wires carry power from your home's existing doorbell wiring. Carefully disconnect these wires. They are usually held by small screws. Use your Phillips head screwdriver to loosen these screws. Gently pull the wires free. Make sure you already turned off the power at the breaker box before doing this. Tuck the exposed wires back into the wall opening. This protects them until you are ready to install a new doorbell.

## Removing the Blink Doorbell Mount: Screwed Mounts

Many Blink doorbell mounts attach to the wall with screws. This is a common and secure method. Removing these mounts is usually straightforward. I find that most installations are designed to be simple.

Once the doorbell unit is off and power is handled, you can see the screws. The mount itself is often a plastic or metal plate. Look closely at the surface of the mount. You will see two or four screw heads. These screws hold the mount firmly to the wall.

Choose the correct screwdriver size. A Phillips head screwdriver is most common. Insert the screwdriver into the screw head. Turn counter-clockwise to loosen the screw. Keep turning until the screw comes completely out. Place the screws in your small container. This prevents them from getting lost.

Repeat this process for all visible screws. Once all screws are removed, the mount should be loose. Gently pull the mount away from the wall. It might stick slightly due to paint or weather sealants. A gentle wiggle often helps. If it is stubborn, you can use a flathead screwdriver to gently pry it. Place the flathead screwdriver carefully between the mount and the wall. Apply light pressure to create a small gap. Avoid forcing it, as this can damage the wall. The mount should come off easily after this.

After removing the mount, inspect the wall area. You will see holes from the screws. There might also be marks or residue from the mount. Keep these in mind for wall repair later.

## Removing the Blink Doorbell Mount: Adhesive or No-Screw Mounts

Some Blink doorbell mounts, or third-party mounts used with Blink doorbells, might not use screws. They rely on strong adhesive or double-sided tape. Removing these mounts needs a different approach. This can be trickier than screwed mounts. Sometimes, you might even have to figure out how to [remove a doorbell that has no screws](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-doorbell-that-has-no-screws).

The main challenge with adhesive mounts is breaking the bond. The adhesive is designed to be very strong. You do not want to pull too hard. This can strip paint or damage the wall surface. Heat is a great tool for weakening adhesive.

You can use a hairdryer or a heat gun on a low setting. Hold the heat source about 6-12 inches away from the mount. Move it slowly over the entire surface of the mount for 30-60 seconds. The heat will warm up the adhesive. This makes it softer and less sticky. Be careful not to overheat the plastic mount.

Once the adhesive is warm, try to gently pry the mount away from the wall. You can use a thin, sturdy tool. A plastic putty knife works well. A strong piece of dental floss or fishing line can also work wonders. Slide the floss behind the mount, working it from top to bottom in a sawing motion. This cuts through the adhesive layer.

If the mount is still stuck, apply more heat. Try to peel it slowly. If paint starts to peel, stop and reapply heat. You can also try a specialized adhesive remover. Apply a small amount to a corner. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then try to pry again. This method helps to minimize damage to your wall.

## Repairing and Prepping the Wall Surface After Removal

Once the Blink doorbell mount is off, you will likely see some imperfections on the wall. These can include screw holes, adhesive residue, or paint damage. Repairing the wall is important. It makes the area look neat and ready for anything new. I always finish a project by cleaning up properly.

First, address any adhesive residue. If you used an adhesive mount, sticky marks might remain. You can use a mild adhesive remover or rubbing alcohol on a soft cloth. Gently rub the residue until it comes off. For stubborn spots, a plastic scraper can help. Be careful not to scratch the wall surface or remove existing paint.

Next, focus on the holes. If your mount was screwed in, you will have screw holes. For small holes, a bit of spackle or wall filler is enough. Apply a small amount over each hole using a putty knife. Make sure the filler is flush with the wall surface. For larger holes, you might need a patch kit. Let the filler dry completely. The drying time is usually on the product's label.

After the filler dries, gently sand the area. Use fine-grit sandpaper. The goal is to make the repaired spot smooth and even with the surrounding wall. Wipe away any dust with a clean cloth.

Finally, you might want to touch up the paint. Find paint that matches your wall color. Apply a thin coat over the repaired areas. Let it dry, then apply a second coat if needed. This step makes the area look like new. Your front entrance will be clean and ready.

## Reinstalling or Upgrading Your Doorbell System

After removing the old mount and repairing the wall, you have options. You can reinstall your Blink doorbell, or you can upgrade to a new system. This part is about setting up your entrance for the future. I enjoy setting up new gadgets.

If you are reinstalling your Blink doorbell, use the original mount if it's in good condition. Otherwise, you may need a new mount. Follow the installation instructions that came with your Blink doorbell. You will typically drill new pilot holes, screw the mount to the wall, and then attach the doorbell unit. Ensure proper power connection. For wired setups, reconnect the wires you disconnected earlier. Remember to turn the power back on at the circuit breaker after wiring.

When reinstalling, ensure your Blink doorbell connects properly to your home system. This often means linking it with your Sync Module. Learn how to [connect your Blink doorbell to a Sync Module](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-connect-blink-doorbell-to-sync-module) for optimal performance. Proper connection ensures that your doorbell works as intended.

If you are upgrading to a different doorbell, follow the new doorbell's specific installation guide. Most smart doorbells have similar mounting principles. However, screw patterns or wiring needs might differ. Always consult the new product's manual. Some new doorbells may work with different chimes. You might need to check if your [Blink doorbell can connect to a wireless chime](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-blink-doorbell-connect-to-wireless-chime) if you are adding new components.

Test your doorbell after installation. Press the button. Check that it rings inside your home. Make sure you get notifications on your phone. This ensures everything is working correctly. Your front door security is now back in action.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What if my Blink doorbell is stuck on its mount?
If your Blink doorbell is stuck, check for a release pinhole or tab. Insert the small tool that came with your doorbell into the hole. Push firmly while sliding the doorbell up or pulling it away. Sometimes, a gentle wiggle helps to loosen it. Do not force it, as this can break the plastic.

### Can I reuse the old screw holes for a new doorbell?
You might be able to reuse the old screw holes. This depends on the new doorbell's mounting plate. If the new plate has the same screw hole alignment, you can. Often, new doorbells have slightly different patterns. If so, you will need to drill new pilot holes.

### How do I clean adhesive residue without damaging paint?
To clean adhesive residue without paint damage, start with rubbing alcohol or a mild adhesive remover on a soft cloth. Test it on a hidden spot first. Gently rub the residue. If it is very stubborn, use a plastic scraper at a low angle. Heat from a hairdryer can also soften the adhesive, making it easier to remove.

### Do I need to turn off power if my Blink doorbell is battery-powered?

### What should I do if I accidentally damage the wall during removal?
If you accidentally damage the wall, do not worry. For small holes or chips, use spackle or wall filler. Apply it with a putty knife, smooth it, and let it dry. Then, sand gently and touch up with matching paint. For larger damage, a wall repair patch kit might be necessary before painting.

### How long does it take to remove a Blink doorbell mount?
Removing a Blink doorbell mount usually takes about 15 to 30 minutes. This includes gathering tools, disconnecting the doorbell, and removing the mount. Wall repair and painting will add more time. A simple screwed mount comes off quicker than a stubborn adhesive one.
