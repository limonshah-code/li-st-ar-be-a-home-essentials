Local electricity rates are another critical factor. These rates vary significantly by region and even by time of day. You can find your electricity rate on your utility bill. To estimate your monthly running cost, you can multiply the stove's wattage by your average daily usage hours and your electricity rate. On average, most households spend between $25 and $75 per month on electricity for their electric stove. This cost includes both the stovetop and the oven functions. Understanding these ongoing expenses helps you budget accurately. You can also compare this to the running costs of other appliances, like exploring [how much does electric oven cost to run](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-does-electric-oven-cost-to-run) for more detailed oven expenses.

Maintaining your electric stove properly can extend its lifespan and reduce repair costs. Like any appliance, electric stoves require some care. Over time, parts can wear out or break. Knowing what to expect for maintenance and repair expenses helps you budget.

Regular cleaning is the most important maintenance step. For glass-top stoves, this means wiping spills immediately and using appropriate cleaners. This prevents food from baking onto the surface, which can lead to permanent stains or damage. If you have a glass-top stove, learning [how to clean glass top electric stoves](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-glass-top-electric-stoves) effectively can save you from costly repairs. For coil stoves, regular cleaning of drip pans and burner elements keeps them efficient. Proper care also includes not using abrasive materials that can scratch surfaces.

Common repair issues include faulty heating elements, broken control knobs, or malfunctioning oven igniters. The cost of replacing a single burner element is usually around $50-$150 for parts and labor. A new control board or thermostat can cost more, often $200-$400 or higher. The labor cost for a repair technician can be $75-$150 per hour. I always recommend getting a diagnostic fee quote upfront.

Sometimes, the cost of repair outweighs the value of the stove. If your stove is old and repairs are frequent or expensive, replacing it might be a better option. Consider the age of your appliance and its current market value. A general rule is if the repair cost is more than 50% of the cost of a new stove, replacement makes more sense. Taking good care of your electric stove can prevent many of these issues.
