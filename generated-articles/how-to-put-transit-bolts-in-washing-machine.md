## Securing Your Washer: How To Put Transit Bolts In Washing Machine

Moving a washing machine requires care. You must protect its internal parts. Putting transit bolts in your washing machine is a critical step. These bolts secure the drum during transport. Without them, the drum can swing freely, causing damage to the machine's suspension system or other components.

This guide will show you how to install these essential shipping bolts. I will explain why they are important. You will learn what tools you need for the job. Then, I will provide a clear, step-by-step process. We will also look at common mistakes to avoid. This information helps you move your appliance safely.

### Takeaway

*   Transit bolts protect your washing machine's drum and internal parts during transport.
*   Gather necessary tools like a spanner and the original transit bolts.
*   Follow specific steps to locate holes, align bolts, and tighten them properly.
*   Mistakes like improper tightening or forgetting bolt removal can cause damage.

## Understanding Washing Machine Transit Bolts: Why They Matter

When you buy a new washing machine, it comes with transit bolts already installed. These bolts are for safety during delivery. They hold the machine's drum firmly in place. This stops the drum from moving around during transport. The drum hangs on springs and shock absorbers inside the machine.

Without transit bolts, the drum can bounce and hit the machine's casing. This causes serious damage to the suspension system. It can also harm the motor or other vital components. If you plan to move your washing machine, you must put these bolts back in. This simple step saves you from costly repairs. It keeps your appliance in good working condition. Remember, these bolts are not for regular use. You only install them for moving the machine.

Many manufacturers design specific transit bolts for their models. For example, [installing Bosch washing machine transit bolts](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-bosch-washing-machine-transit-bolts) might involve a slightly different mechanism or bolt type compared to other brands. Always check your washing machine's user manual. It contains specific instructions for your model. Knowing your machine's requirements helps you perform the task correctly. Protecting your washing machine during a move is always worth the effort.

## Essential Tools for Installing Washing Machine Shipping Bolts

Before you begin, gather all the items you need. This makes the process smooth and quick. You will primarily need the transit bolts themselves. These bolts usually come with the washing machine when you first buy it. They are often stored in a plastic bag or taped to the back of the machine. If you do not have them, you may need to order replacements from the manufacturer.

Next, you will need a spanner or wrench. The size of the spanner depends on the size of your transit bolts. A standard adjustable wrench often works well. Some bolts might have a slot for a flathead screwdriver. Check the bolt heads to see what tool fits best. You might also want a flashlight. This helps you see the bolt holes clearly.

Finally, consider having a soft cloth or a blanket. This is useful for protecting your floor. You might need to tilt the machine slightly. Having the right tools at hand prevents frustration. It also helps you complete the job safely. Always confirm you have the correct bolts for your specific model.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How To Put Transit Bolts In Washing Machine Safely

Putting transit bolts back into your washing machine is a clear process. Follow these steps carefully to ensure drum protection. This helps prevent damage during transport. I will guide you through each part of the installation.

**1. Prepare Your Washing Machine:**
First, unplug your washing machine from the power outlet. Turn off the water supply taps. Disconnect the water inlet and drainage hoses. Drain any remaining water from the hoses and machine. This makes the machine lighter and safer to handle.

**2. Locate the Transit Bolt Holes:**
Most washing machines have transit bolt holes on the back panel. These holes are usually covered with plastic caps. Some machines have four holes, others may have three or five. Refer to your washing machine manual if you cannot find them. Remove these plastic caps to expose the holes. You might need a screwdriver to pry them off.

**3. Align and Insert the Bolts:**
Take one transit bolt. Align its end with one of the exposed holes. Push the bolt into the hole. You might feel some resistance as it goes through the outer casing and into the inner drum mechanism. The bolt needs to go deep enough to engage with the drum.

**4. Secure the Bolts:**
Once the bolt is in place, you will see a thread or a locking mechanism. Use your spanner or screwdriver to tighten the bolt. Turn it clockwise until it feels snug. Do not overtighten, but make sure it is firm. The goal is to stop the drum from moving freely. Repeat this process for all remaining transit bolt holes. Check that all bolts are secure and the drum no longer moves easily. When you do it yourself, you take full control of the process, ensuring peace of mind before a move. [Doing it yourself with a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) can save time and money.

**5. Double-Check and Test:**
Gently try to rock the washing machine's drum by hand. It should feel stable and not bounce. If it still moves a lot, recheck the bolts. Ensure they are all fully inserted and tightened. This step is important for safe transport. A properly secured drum prevents internal damage.

## Specific Considerations for Different Washing Machine Models

While the general principle of installing transit bolts remains the same, specific washing machine models can have variations. Understanding these differences helps you perform the task correctly for your appliance. For example, front-load washing machines typically have their transit bolts at the back. Top-load washing machines often do not use transit bolts because their drum design is different. Some top-loaders might use foam or cardboard packing materials instead. Always consult your user manual for model-specific instructions.

Different brands might also have unique bolt designs or installation methods. For instance, [Bosch washing machine transit bolts](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-bosch-washing-machine-transit-bolts) often come with specific plastic sleeves. These sleeves help secure the bolt properly. Samsung washing machines, while similar in concept, might have different cap removal methods or bolt shapes. Even if you're looking at a different appliance like a [Samsung dryer and its shipping bolts](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-samsung-dryer-have-shipping-bolts), the principle of securing internal components for transport is universal across brands. Always use the original bolts that came with your specific washing machine. Replacement bolts might not fit or secure the drum correctly.

Additionally, some larger or commercial washing machines might have more transit bolts or require specialized tools. If you have an older model, the bolts might be harder to remove or install due to wear. Take your time and follow the specific guidelines for your appliance. This ensures proper protection during any move.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Installing Transit Bolts

Installing transit bolts seems simple, but mistakes can happen. Avoiding these errors is crucial for protecting your washing machine. One common mistake is not tightening the bolts enough. If the bolts are loose, the drum can still move during transit. This defeats the purpose of the bolts. Always ensure they are snug and secure. The drum should feel stable when you try to move it by hand.

Another error is overtightening the bolts. This can strip the threads of the bolts or damage the machine's casing. Tighten them firmly, but stop when you feel resistance. Do not use excessive force. Always check your manual for specific torque recommendations if available. Losing the original transit bolts is also a common problem. If you do not have the right bolts, do not use substitutes. Incorrect bolts may not fit properly or provide adequate protection. Order replacement bolts from the manufacturer to ensure a correct fit.

Forgetting to put all the bolts back in is another frequent oversight. Most washing machines have three or four transit bolt holes. Make sure you install one in every designated spot. Skipping even one bolt can compromise the drum's stability. Also, some people forget to remove the plastic caps before installing the bolts. These caps cover the holes. They must be taken off first. Paying attention to these small details prevents bigger issues.

## Preparing Your Washing Machine for Transport After Bolt Installation

Once you have successfully installed the transit bolts, your washing machine is ready for the next steps of transport. These additional preparations ensure a smoother and safer move. First, secure all hoses and cables. Wrap the water inlet hoses and the drainage hose together. You can use zip ties or strong tape. Make sure they are not dangling. This prevents them from getting caught or damaged during loading.

Next, consider wrapping the entire washing machine. Use moving blankets or thick sheets. This protects the outer casing from scratches and dents. Secure the blankets with moving straps or tape. If you are moving the machine yourself, plan your route. Ensure doorways and hallways are wide enough. Measure the machine and your access points. This prevents frustrating delays.

When lifting the washing machine, always use proper lifting techniques. Washing machines are very heavy. Always lift with two people or more. Bend your knees and lift with your legs, not your back. Consider using an appliance dolly. This tool makes moving the heavy machine much easier. It also helps prevent potential injuries. Using a dolly allows you to [make your washing machine not move](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-washing-machine-not-move) unexpectedly during relocation. Proper preparation, including securing hoses and wrapping the machine, significantly reduces the risk of damage during the move.

## When to Use Transit Bolts (and When to Remove Them)

Understanding when to use transit bolts is as important as knowing how to install them. You should always use transit bolts whenever you move your washing machine. This includes moving it to a new house or apartment. It also applies if you transport it to a repair shop. Any time the machine is taken off its installed location for movement, the bolts must be in place. They prevent internal components from shifting or breaking due to vibrations and bumps.

Transit bolts are only for transport. You must remove them before you use the washing machine for the first time in its new location. Running the washing machine with the transit bolts installed causes severe damage. The drum cannot move freely, putting immense stress on the motor and suspension. This can lead to loud noises, violent shaking, and even complete machine failure. Always remove the bolts before connecting water and power.

After removing the transit bolts, save them in a safe place. Many people tape them to the back of the machine or store them with the user manual. This way, you know where to find them for any future moves. Losing them means you will need to buy replacements. Knowing when to install and remove these bolts ensures your washing machine stays protected and functions correctly for years to come.
