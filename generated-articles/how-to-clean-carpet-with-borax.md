Before you start cleaning, safety is important. Borax is natural, but it is not harmless. Always handle it with care. You should wear gloves to protect your skin.

A clean carpet is a happy carpet. After your Borax treatment, maintain its freshness. Regular care extends the life of your carpet. It also keeps your home looking its best.
