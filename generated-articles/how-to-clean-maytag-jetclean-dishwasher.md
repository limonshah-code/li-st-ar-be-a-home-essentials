### Takeaway

*   Regularly clean your Maytag Jetclean dishwasher filter to prevent clogs and odors.
*   Use vinegar or baking soda for an effective, natural deep clean.
*   Clean spray arms, door seals, and the dispenser for optimal performance.
*   Address drain issues promptly to avoid standing water.

To clean your Maytag Jetclean dishwasher, you must remove the filter for a thorough rinse. Then, run an empty hot water cycle with a dishwasher cleaner, vinegar, or baking soda. Finally, wipe down the interior and exterior surfaces, including door seals and spray arms, to remove grime.

## Why Your Maytag Jetclean Dishwasher Needs Cleaning

Your dishwasher works hard every day. It handles food scraps, grease, and soap scum. Over time, these residues accumulate inside the appliance. This buildup affects its performance. It can also lead to foul odors.

A dirty dishwasher cannot clean your dishes well. Food particles can redeposit onto dishes during cycles. Hard water leaves mineral deposits that clog spray arms and filters. These blockages reduce water pressure and prevent proper rinsing. You might notice cloudy glasses or food stuck on plates. Regular cleaning ensures your Maytag Jetclean system works as intended. This process helps your appliance last longer. It also keeps your dishes sparkling clean.

## Prepare Your Maytag Jetclean for Cleaning

Before you start any deep cleaning, prepare your dishwasher. This initial step makes the cleaning process easier and safer. First, make sure the dishwasher is completely empty. Remove all dishes, silverware, and racks. Check for any large food debris at the bottom.

If you find large food pieces, remove them by hand. You do not want them to go down the drain. This prevents potential clogs later on. Next, check the detergent dispenser and rinse aid compartment. Ensure they are clear of any old, crusted detergent. Preparing your appliance properly ensures the cleaning agents can work effectively. This step sets the stage for a thorough clean.

## Clean the Maytag Jetclean Dishwasher Filter

The filter is one of the most important parts to clean in your Maytag Jetclean dishwasher. It traps food particles, preventing them from recirculating. Over time, this filter can become clogged. A clogged filter is a primary reason for poor cleaning performance and bad odors. Many people do not realize their Maytag dishwasher has a filter. Knowing [do Maytag dishwashers have filters](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-maytag-dishwashers-have-filters) is the first step in proper maintenance.

Locating and cleaning the filter is usually straightforward. Most Maytag Jetclean models have a removable cylindrical filter at the bottom. Twist it counter-clockwise to unlock and lift it out. Rinse the filter under running water. Use an old toothbrush or soft brush to gently scrub away any stuck-on debris. You want to remove all food particles and grease. Make sure to clean the mesh screen thoroughly.

## Deep Clean the Interior with Natural Solutions

After cleaning the filter, focus on the interior of your Maytag Jetclean dishwasher. You can use common household items for a powerful, natural deep clean. Vinegar and baking soda are excellent for removing grease, hard water stains, and odors. These are safe and effective alternatives to harsh chemicals.

### Using Vinegar for a Sparkly Interior

Vinegar is a natural acid that cuts through grease and dissolves mineral deposits. It also helps sanitize and deodorize. Place a cup of white vinegar in a dishwasher-safe bowl. Put the bowl on the top rack of your empty Maytag Jetclean dishwasher. Do not add any detergent. Run a hot water cycle. The steam from the hot water will distribute the vinegar, cleaning the interior thoroughly.

The vinegar cycle will leave your dishwasher smelling fresh and looking clean. This method is effective for general maintenance.

### Baking Soda for Stubborn Odors

Baking soda is a natural deodorizer. It is great for absorbing unpleasant smells that linger in your dishwasher.

The baking soda will help absorb any remaining odors and further polish the interior. This two-step process with vinegar and baking soda provides a very effective deep clean.

## Tackle Spray Arms, Door Seals, and Detergent Dispenser

While the main cleaning cycles handle much of the interior, some parts need individual attention. The spray arms, door seals, and detergent dispenser are common areas for grime buildup. Cleaning these specific components ensures your Maytag Jetclean dishwasher works at its best. Neglecting them can lead to poor wash results or even leaks.

### Clean the Spray Arms

The spray arms have small holes that jet water onto your dishes. These holes can get clogged with food particles or mineral deposits. This reduces the water flow and cleaning effectiveness. You can usually remove the spray arms by unscrewing them or pulling them off. Once removed, use a toothpick or small wire to clear any clogged holes. Rinse them thoroughly under running water. Use a soft brush and warm, soapy water to clean the entire surface of the spray arms. Make sure all the holes are clear before reattaching them. Clear spray arms ensure proper water distribution for superior cleaning.

### Wipe Down Door Seals and Gaskets

The rubber door seals and gaskets prevent water from leaking out of your dishwasher. They also trap food particles, mold, and mildew. Over time, these can become quite dirty and develop black spots. Use a damp cloth soaked in white vinegar or a mild all-purpose cleaner. Thoroughly wipe down all visible door seals. Pay close attention to crevices where grime can hide. For tougher mold spots, you might need a small brush. Ensuring these seals are clean helps maintain a tight seal. This also prevents [how to clean mold in dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-dishwasher) from spreading.

### Clean the Detergent Dispenser

The detergent dispenser can accumulate residue from old detergent or rinse aid. This can prevent it from opening properly or dispensing detergent effectively. Use a damp cloth to wipe out any residue inside the dispenser. If there is stubborn buildup, a small brush or toothpick can help. Make sure the dispenser door opens and closes smoothly. A clean dispenser ensures your detergent reaches the dishes at the right time.

## Address the Dishwasher Drain and Exterior

Even after cleaning the interior components, it is important to address the drain area and the exterior of your Maytag Jetclean dishwasher. The drain can be a source of persistent odors if not properly maintained. The exterior, while less critical for performance, affects the overall look of your kitchen. Keeping these areas clean contributes to a hygienic environment.

### Clear the Dishwasher Drain

The drain is located at the very bottom of the dishwasher tub. This is where dirty water exits. Small food particles can still accumulate here, even after filter cleaning. Use a paper towel or sponge to wipe the drain area. Look for any visible debris or standing water. If water is not draining properly, it can lead to unpleasant smells and poor washing. For more guidance on clearing blockages, refer to our guide on [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain). Ensuring the drain is clear helps your dishwasher function without issues.

### Clean the Exterior and Control Panel

The exterior of your Maytag Jetclean dishwasher needs attention too. Use a soft, damp cloth with a mild all-purpose cleaner. Wipe down the front panel, sides, and top edge. For stainless steel finishes, use a specialized stainless steel cleaner to avoid streaks. Pay attention to the control panel buttons or touch screen. These areas collect fingerprints and grime. Use a slightly damp cloth for the control panel. Avoid spraying cleaner directly onto electronic components. A clean exterior gives your entire kitchen a fresh look.

Keeping your Maytag Jetclean dishwasher clean is not a one-time task. Regular maintenance is essential for consistent performance. Establishing a routine helps prevent major buildups and keeps your appliance running efficiently.
