The most important step is cutting and rolling the carpet. Cut the carpet into manageable strips. A utility knife works well for this. Strips of about 2 to 4 feet wide are good. Roll each strip tightly. Secure each roll with duct tape or rope. This keeps them compact and easy to carry. Labeling the rolls "carpet" helps staff quickly identify the material.

Many communities work hard to provide options for bulky waste. By using these services correctly, you contribute to a cleaner environment. Always follow local guidelines. This ensures your old carpet is handled in the best way possible.
