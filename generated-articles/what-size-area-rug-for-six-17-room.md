## Choosing the Perfect Area Rug for Your 6x17 Room

Finding the right area rug can transform any space. However, when your room has unique dimensions, like a "Six 17 Room" (meaning 6 feet by 17 feet), the task becomes more specific. A narrow, long room presents both challenges and exciting design opportunities. You want a rug that enhances the space, not one that overwhelms it or looks out of place.

I understand the struggle of fitting standard sizes into non-standard rooms. This article provides you with clear guidance. We will explore various rug sizes, discuss smart placement strategies, and cover important considerations like material and design. By the end, you will know exactly what size area rug to choose for your 6x17 foot room, making your space feel inviting and stylish.

### Takeaway

*   **Consider 5x7 or 4x6 Area Rugs:** These sizes often fit well in a 6x17 room for defining specific zones.
*   **Utilize Runner Rugs:** Multiple runners, or a very long custom runner, are ideal for emphasizing the length of a 6x17 space.
*   **Maintain Borders:** Leave at least 12-18 inches of exposed flooring around the rug edges in a narrow room.
*   **Define Zones:** Use rugs to create distinct areas in a long, narrow room, like an entry and seating space.
*   **Choose Durable Materials:** Opt for rugs made from wool or synthetic fibers for high-traffic narrow areas.

A 6x17 foot room is a long, narrow space. For this room, consider a 5x7 area rug to anchor a specific seating zone. Alternatively, use one or two 2x10 or 2x12 runner rugs to emphasize the room's length. Always leave at least 12-18 inches of bare floor around the rug for balance.

## Understanding Your 6x17 Foot Room Dimensions

A room measuring 6 feet by 17 feet is distinctly long and narrow. This specific dimension immediately tells us we are dealing with a unique space. It could be a long hallway, a compact galley kitchen, or a very narrow living area. Understanding these characteristics helps in selecting the correct rug.

This shape means standard square or large rectangular rugs might not work as easily. The goal is to choose a rug that complements the room's proportions, not fights them. We want to enhance the sense of flow and make the space feel intentionally designed. I often visualize the room shape before even looking at rug options.

The length is almost three times its width. This ratio impacts how light travels and how furniture fits. A rug choice must respect this elongated form. It should guide the eye along the room.

Considering the practical use of the space is also key. Is it a high-traffic zone? Does it serve multiple functions? Your rug needs to perform its job effectively in this specific environment. Let us explore the best area rug sizes next.

## Standard Area Rug Sizes for Narrow Spaces

Selecting the right area rug size for a 6x17 room means thinking outside the box of common rug dimensions. Most rug guides assume wider rooms. For your long, narrow "Six 17 Room," you have a few good options. Standard rectangular rugs or multiple runners can work beautifully. It is all about how you want the rug to define the space.

### Runner Rugs for a Long 6x17 Space

Runner rugs are often the first thought for a long, narrow room. They naturally follow the room's elongated shape. You can use one very long runner or multiple shorter ones. A single custom-sized runner, say 2.5 feet by 15 feet, could stretch most of the room's length. This option creates a continuous path and makes the room feel longer.

However, custom sizes can be more expensive. Standard runners come in sizes like 2x6, 2x8, 2x10, or 2x12 feet. You could place two 2x8 runners with a small gap between them. This approach allows for flexibility and can define different functional areas within the room. For instance, one runner might be by the entrance, another near a console table.

### Considering Smaller Area Rugs

Sometimes, a single large rug is not the answer. For a 6x17 room, using one or two smaller rectangular area rugs can be very effective. A 4x6 foot rug, for example, leaves 1 foot of bare floor on the sides and varying lengths on the ends. This size is good for anchoring a specific seating arrangement, like two small chairs facing each other. A 5x7 foot rug is another excellent choice for defining a distinct zone within the room. It offers a bit more coverage without overwhelming the narrow width.

I find that using multiple smaller rugs can break up the visual length of a "Six 17 Room." This makes it feel less like a corridor and more like a series of connected spaces. You could use one rug near the entrance and another further down to define a reading nook. The key is to leave enough bare floor around each rug. This creates a pleasing visual border.

## Optimal Rug Placement Strategies in a 6x17 Room

Proper rug placement is crucial for a 6x17 foot room. The way you position your area rug can either enhance or detract from the space. Since it is a long and narrow room, you want to create balance and flow. My goal is always to make the room feel more expansive and purposeful.

We generally aim for a border of exposed flooring around the rug. In a 6-foot wide room, you should leave at least 12-18 inches of bare floor on each side. This means your rug should be approximately 3-4 feet wide. For the 17-foot length, you can adjust the border more flexibly, depending on whether you use one or multiple rugs. This guideline helps avoid making the room feel smaller or cluttered.

### Defining Zones with Rugs

A long, narrow "Six 17 Room" can often benefit from distinct zones. An area rug is perfect for this purpose. You might have an entry zone, a small seating area, and perhaps a console table zone. Using a 4x6 or 5x7 rug in a specific spot can clearly delineate a functional area. For example, a 5x7 rug could anchor a cozy reading corner.

If you are using multiple rugs, ensure they are spaced appropriately. Do not place them too close together, as this can create a busy look. A small gap, perhaps 12-24 inches, between rugs allows each zone to breathe. This technique also helps to break up the visual linearity of the long room. I recommend sketching out your room layout first.

### Furniture Layout and Rug Integration

Furniture placement works hand-in-hand with rug placement in a 6x17 room. For a small seating area, position the front legs of all main furniture pieces on the rug. This creates a cohesive grouping. For example, if you have two narrow armchairs, place them so their front legs rest on a 4x6 rug. This makes the rug feel integrated with the furniture.

If your 6x17 room is more of a hallway, consider placing a runner down the center. Ensure it leaves ample space on either side for walking. If there is furniture along one wall, like a bench or a console, the runner can run parallel to it. The rug should complement the furniture's purpose. It should not impede movement. This thoughtful approach makes the room both functional and beautiful.

## Selecting Rug Material and Pile for a High-Traffic Area

The "Six 17 Room" often functions as a high-traffic zone. Think about hallways, entryways, or even narrow living spaces. The material and pile of your area rug significantly impact its durability and how it feels underfoot. Making the right choice here ensures your rug lasts and remains beautiful. I always consider the amount of foot traffic a rug will endure.

Choosing robust materials is key for any rug in a frequently used area. Natural fibers like wool are excellent. Wool is naturally stain-resistant and incredibly durable. It can withstand heavy foot traffic for many years. Synthetic options, such as polypropylene or nylon, are also strong contenders. They are often more affordable, easy to clean, and highly resistant to wear and tear.

### Durable Materials for Longevity

For a 6x17 room, I typically recommend materials that can handle daily wear. Wool rugs are a timeless choice. They offer a luxurious feel and impressive resilience. You can clean wool rugs relatively easily, which is important for any high-traffic area. Just address spills quickly.

Synthetic fibers, like polypropylene, are also a fantastic option. They resist moisture, fading, and stains. This makes them ideal for homes with pets or children. Polypropylene rugs are also very budget-friendly. They come in many styles and colors. Nylon is another durable synthetic fiber. It offers great elasticity and recovers well from crushing. Consider jute or sisal for a natural, textural look, but note they might be rougher and less soft underfoot. They are very sturdy, though.

### Pile Height and Comfort

The pile height of your area rug affects both its look and its functionality. Low-pile rugs are generally best for high-traffic areas. They are easier to vacuum and less likely to trip people. A low pile also resists matting down. This keeps your rug looking fresh.

Medium-pile rugs offer a good balance of comfort and durability. They provide more cushioning than low-pile options. These might work well in a 6x17 room that serves as a living or seating area. High-pile or shag rugs, while soft, are usually not recommended for heavy traffic zones. They can collect dirt and debris more easily. They also require more frequent cleaning. Always think about how the room is used when choosing the pile. A thin rug pad can add comfort to any pile height.

## Color, Pattern, and Texture: Design Impact in Narrow Rooms

The color, pattern, and texture of your area rug play a significant role in a 6x17 room. These elements can visually expand the space or make it feel cozier. My goal is always to create a harmonious and inviting atmosphere. The right rug can work wonders in a long, narrow space.

Light colors generally make a room feel larger and more open. A light-colored rug can reflect more light. This brightens up a potentially dark hallway. Conversely, darker colors tend to make a space feel more enclosed. However, a dark rug can also add a sense of drama or ground the space. It depends on your desired aesthetic.

### Visual Tricks for Small Spaces

Patterns can also influence the perception of space. A rug with horizontal stripes can make a narrow room appear wider. This is a clever visual trick I use often. Conversely, vertical stripes would emphasize the length, which might be too much in a 6x17 room. Small, subtle patterns are generally safer than large, bold ones. Large patterns can overwhelm a narrow space.

Consider a rug with a subtle, all-over texture. A textured rug adds visual interest without being too busy. It can provide depth and warmth. Think about natural fibers like jute or sisal if you want a lot of texture. For softer options, look for wool or cotton rugs with a woven or braided texture. The texture adds a layer of sophistication.

### Harmonizing with Existing Decor

Your chosen rug should always complement the existing decor of your 6x17 room. Look at your wall colors, furniture, and existing accents. The rug's colors should either match or provide a pleasing contrast. For example, if your walls are neutral, a rug with a pop of color can add personality. If your furniture is very patterned, a solid-colored rug might be best.

Texture also needs to harmonize. If you have smooth, modern furniture, a high-pile shag rug might feel out of place. A low-pile, subtly textured rug would integrate better. I always suggest bringing home rug samples if possible. This allows you to see how the colors and textures look in your specific room's lighting. It ensures a cohesive and appealing final look.

## Measuring Your 6x17 Room for Accurate Rug Sizing

Accurate measurement is the foundation of choosing the perfect area rug for your 6x17 foot room. Without precise numbers, you risk buying a rug that is too big or too small. This section will guide you through the measuring process. I want you to feel confident in your rug purchase.

First, always measure the entire length and width of your "Six 17 Room." Do not just eyeball it. Use a tape measure and, if possible, have someone help you. Measure from wall to wall. Write down these exact dimensions. In your case, that is 6 feet by 17 feet.

### Essential Measuring Tips

When measuring, note any architectural features. These include doorways, built-in shelving, or heating vents. These elements might impact where a rug can lie. For example, you do not want a rug to block a doorway or vent. Also, consider the swing of any doors. Ensure the rug's thickness does not interfere with opening and closing them.

Think about the furniture you have or plan to put in the room. Place your furniture first if you can. Then measure the available floor space around it. This helps you determine where a rug can fit comfortably. You want the rug to anchor the furniture. It should not float randomly in the room. A great resource for general sizing is [what size rug do i need for my room](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-size-rug-do-i-need-for-my-room).

### The "Leave-a-Border" Rule

The "leave-a-border" rule is especially important in a narrow 6x17 foot room. As discussed, aim for 12-18 inches of exposed flooring on all sides of the rug. This creates a visual frame. It prevents the rug from looking like wall-to-wall carpeting. It also makes the room feel more intentional.

For your 6-foot wide room, a rug should be about 3-4 feet wide. This leaves about 1 to 1.5 feet of bare floor on each 6-foot side. For the 17-foot length, if you use a single rug, its length will depend on the zones you create. If you use a 12-foot runner, you leave 2.5 feet on each end. If you use a 15-foot runner, you leave 1 foot on each end. I find that allowing some breathing room around the rug makes the room appear larger. This small detail can significantly impact the overall feel. It prevents the rug from making the already narrow room feel even more cramped.

## Budgeting and Sourcing Your Ideal Rug for a 6x17 Space

Budgeting for an area rug in a 6x17 room involves considering both standard and potentially custom sizes. Sourcing the right rug also requires knowing where to look. I want to help you find a beautiful rug that fits both your space and your wallet. Understanding the cost factors beforehand saves you time and frustration.

The price of an area rug varies widely. Factors include material, size, brand, and construction method. Natural fibers like wool are generally more expensive than synthetic ones like polypropylene. Hand-knotted rugs cost more than machine-made ones. A 6x17 foot room might require a specific size, which could influence the cost.

### Cost Considerations for Unique Sizes

If you opt for a standard size like a 4x6 or 5x7 rug, your options are plentiful and generally more affordable. Many retailers stock these common sizes. If you need a long runner, like a 2x12 or 2x14, these are also quite common. The cost per square foot for these standard options is usually lower.

However, if you decide on a truly custom size, like a 3x15 or 4x16 foot rug, expect a higher price. Custom rugs involve specific manufacturing processes. They also take longer to produce. Some rug stores offer broadloom carpets that can be cut to size and bound. This can be a more budget-friendly alternative to a fully custom-made rug. It allows you to get the exact dimensions you need for your 6x17 space.

### Where to Find Specific Rugs

Online retailers are an excellent place to start your search. They offer a vast selection of sizes, styles, and materials. Websites like Wayfair, Rugs.com, and Amazon often have search filters for specific dimensions. This makes finding a 2x10 or 5x7 rug easier. I always recommend reading customer reviews and checking return policies.

Local rug stores or home goods retailers are also valuable. They allow you to see and feel the rugs in person. This helps in judging color and texture accurately. Some specialized rug shops can even create custom-sized rugs for you. If your 6x17 room needs a unique rug solution, they can be a great resource. Do not hesitate to ask about their custom options or broadloom services.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: Can a single rug cover most of a 6x17 room?

Yes, a single rug can cover most of a 6x17 room. A custom runner measuring approximately 3-4 feet wide and 14-15 feet long would work well. This leaves 12-18 inches of exposed floor around the rug. This approach creates a cohesive look and visually lengthens the room. Ensure the rug does not impede any door swings.

### Q2: What are common rug sizes that work for a narrow room?

Common rug sizes for a narrow room like 6x17 feet include runner rugs (e.g., 2x8, 2x10, 2x12 feet). Smaller area rugs like 4x6 or 5x7 feet also work. These sizes help define specific zones. They provide coverage without overwhelming the narrow space.

### Q3: Should I layer rugs in a 6x17 room?

Layering rugs in a 6x17 room is possible but requires careful planning. It can add texture and interest. However, in a narrow space, too much layering might make the room feel cluttered. If you do layer, use a larger, neutral base rug with a smaller, textured rug on top to define a specific area.

### Q4: How much space should be around the rug in a narrow room?

In a narrow room like 6x17 feet, aim to leave 12-18 inches of exposed flooring around the rug. This border prevents the room from feeling cramped. It also allows the rug to stand out as a decorative element. This guideline applies to both the width and length of the room.

### Q5: Does rug color matter in a 6x17 room?

Yes, rug color matters significantly in a 6x17 room. Light-colored rugs can make the narrow space feel larger and brighter. Darker rugs can add depth but might make the room feel smaller. Choose colors that complement your existing decor. Consider patterns that enhance the room's proportions, such as subtle horizontal stripes to visually widen it.
