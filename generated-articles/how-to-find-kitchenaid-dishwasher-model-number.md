*   Refer to your original purchase documents or owner's manual.

To find your KitchenAid dishwasher model number, check the inner door frame, along the top or sides. If it is not there, inspect the edges of the inner tub, or the kickplate at the bottom front. The number is usually on a sticker or metal plate.

## Why Your KitchenAid Dishwasher Model Number Matters

Your KitchenAid dishwasher model number serves many purposes. It is a unique identifier for your specific appliance. You need this number for proper maintenance and repairs. Without it, you might order the wrong parts.

Imagine your dishwasher stops draining properly. You call a technician for help. The first thing they ask is for the model number. This helps them understand your dishwasherâ€™s exact specifications. They can then bring the correct tools or parts. It saves time and prevents mistakes.

Ordering replacement parts also requires the model number. A part for one KitchenAid model may not fit another. Manufacturers make many variations of dishwashers. Each variation has unique components. Knowing your specific model number ensures compatibility. This prevents wasted money on incorrect parts.

The model number helps you find the right owner's manual. Manuals contain important information about usage, care, and troubleshooting. If you lose your paper manual, you can often find a digital version online. You just need the model number to search for it. For example, if you need to find similar information for other appliances, understanding how to locate these numbers is key. This process is similar for finding a [Samsung dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-samsung-dishwasher-model-number) or an [LG dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-lg-dishwasher-model-number). Knowing your model number also helps when registering your appliance for warranty purposes. It makes warranty claims straightforward.

## Checking the Dishwasher Door Frame

The inner door frame is the most common place to find your KitchenAid dishwasher model number. This is the first spot you should check. Open the dishwasher door completely. Look along the edges of the door.

The model number sticker is often located on the left or right side of the door frame. Sometimes it is on the top edge. It is usually a silver or white sticker. The sticker contains various numbers and codes. You are looking for the "Model No." or "Mod." number. The serial number is also usually present here.

Take your time when you search this area. The sticker might be small. It can be hard to see if it is dirty or worn out. Wipe down the area with a damp cloth if needed. Good lighting also helps you read the numbers clearly. I often use my phone's flashlight to get a better view.

Once you find the sticker, write down the full model number. You might also want to note the serial number. Snap a picture with your phone for easy reference. This way, you have it recorded for future use. It saves you from having to check again every time you need it. This method is often the quickest for finding essential appliance details. This location is a prime spot for many brands, similar to where you might find the model number for a [Maytag dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-maytag-dishwasher-model-number).

### Tips for Reading the Sticker:

*   **Clean the Area:** Dust and grime can obscure the numbers.
*   **Use Light:** A flashlight makes small print easier to read.
*   **Photograph It:** A photo provides a digital record.
*   **Look for "Mod." or "Model No.":** These prefixes indicate the model number.

## Inspecting the Inner Tub and Sides

If you do not find the model number on the door frame, the next place to look is inside the dishwasher tub. Manufacturers sometimes place the identification sticker inside the tub itself. This location is still very accessible.

Open the dishwasher door fully. Look along the edges of the inner tub. The sticker can be on the left, right, or even the back wall of the tub. Sometimes it is very close to the opening. It might also be on the underside of the top rack support. You need to look carefully at all surfaces.

The sticker might blend in with the tub material. KitchenAid dishwashers often have stainless steel interiors. A silver sticker can be harder to spot on this surface. Feel around the edges if you cannot see it immediately. Your fingers can sometimes detect the raised edges of a sticker.

Manufacturers choose these spots for durability. The sticker is protected from external damage. However, it can still get wet or covered in food debris over time. If the sticker is dirty, clean it gently. Use a mild cleaner and a soft cloth. Do not scrub too hard, or you might damage the printing.

This location is common for many built-in appliances. It ensures the sticker is present even if the exterior panels are modified. Remember to check both the door frame and the tub thoroughly. One of these spots almost always holds the critical information you need. For example, if you own other KitchenAid appliances, you would follow similar steps to find the model number for a [KitchenAid oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-kitchenaid-oven-model-number).

## Looking at the Kickplate or Bottom Panel

Sometimes, the model number sticker is not inside the dishwasher. In these cases, you will need to check the exterior bottom panel. This panel is often called the kickplate. It sits at the very bottom front of your KitchenAid dishwasher.

The kickplate is usually a narrow strip that covers the area beneath the dishwasher door. It hides the mechanical components. To access the model number here, you may need to remove this panel. Most kickplates are held in place by two or three screws. These screws are usually visible at the bottom edge of the panel.

Use a screwdriver to carefully remove the screws. Once the screws are out, gently pull the kickplate forward or downward. The sticker might be on the inside surface of this panel. It could also be on the frame of the dishwasher behind the panel. Be careful not to pull any wires or hoses.

This location is less common for model numbers. However, some KitchenAid models use it. It is important to check every possible spot. Manufacturers sometimes change sticker locations between models or years. If you are having trouble, refer to your appliance's original manual. The manual often includes a diagram showing the model number location.

After you find the model number, carefully reattach the kickplate. Make sure the screws are tight. This ensures the panel stays in place and protects the components. Checking the kickplate is a good last resort if other methods fail. You might find similar locations for other brands like [Miele dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-miele-dishwasher-model-number).

## Exploring Your Appliance Manual and Documentation

Your KitchenAid dishwasher owner's manual is a valuable resource. It contains a lot of information about your appliance. This includes the model number. If you kept the manual, it is a quick way to find the information.

Look through the first few pages of the manual. The model number is often printed on the front cover. It can also be inside the front cover or on a dedicated "Product Information" page. Some manuals include a section for you to write down your model and serial numbers. If you filled this in, you are in luck.

Your original purchase receipt also often lists the model number. Retailers record this information when you buy an appliance. Check your email for digital receipts. Look through old paper files if you saved them. This can be a very quick way to get the number without physically checking the appliance.

Online resources are also helpful. If you registered your KitchenAid dishwasher, the model number might be in your account. Log in to the KitchenAid website. Check your registered products section. Many manufacturers keep records of your purchases if you registered your warranty.

Remember, the manual also shows you how to care for your dishwasher. It gives troubleshooting tips. Keeping it handy, even a digital copy, is always a good idea. This helps you maintain your appliance better. Always check your paperwork before disassembling anything.

## Using Your Purchase Records and Online Resources

Sometimes, the sticker on your KitchenAid dishwasher is missing or unreadable. This can be frustrating. Do not worry. You still have other options to find the model number. Your purchase records are an excellent starting point.

Think back to when you bought your dishwasher. Did you buy it online or from a local store? If you bought it online, check your order history. Websites like Amazon, Best Buy, or the retailer's own site usually keep detailed records. Your purchase confirmation email also often contains the model number. Search your email inbox for "KitchenAid dishwasher" or the retailer's name.

If you bought it from a physical store, your sales receipt is key. The model number is usually printed on it. Look for paper receipts in your files. Many stores also offer digital receipts. You might find it in your account on their website. Some stores can look up past purchases if you provide the date and your payment method.

Another good resource is the KitchenAid customer support website. They have a "Product Finder" or "Parts & Accessories" section. You might be able to search for your appliance by its serial number if you have it. Sometimes, you can find a list of common models. However, having the exact model number is always best for precise information.

If all else fails, a certified appliance technician can help. When they come for service, they can find the model number for you. They know all the hidden spots. They also have access to service manuals. This helps them identify your specific dishwasher model.

## Understanding the Model Number Format

Once you find your KitchenAid dishwasher model number, understanding its format helps. KitchenAid, like many brands, uses a specific coding system. This system tells you information about the appliance. It is not just a random string of numbers and letters.

KitchenAid model numbers usually start with letters. These letters often indicate the appliance type. For dishwashers, you might see codes like "KDT" or "KUDS." "KDT" often stands for KitchenAid Dishwasher, Top Control. "KUDS" might mean KitchenAid Under-Counter Dishwasher. After the letters, a series of numbers and more letters follow.

The numbers usually denote the generation or series of the dishwasher. They also indicate features or capacity. For example, a higher number might mean a newer model. It could also point to more advanced features. The last few characters sometimes signify the color or finish. "SS" could mean stainless steel. "WH" might stand for white.

The serial number is different from the model number. The serial number identifies a single unit. It tells you when and where that specific dishwasher was made. It is unique to your appliance. The model number refers to a type or series of appliances. All dishwashers of the same model have the same model number.

Knowing this helps you talk to service people. You can tell them exactly what type of KitchenAid dishwasher you have. It makes ordering parts much easier. They can verify you are looking for the correct part for your model. It removes guesswork. This knowledge is useful across different appliance brands. For example, understanding an [LG refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-read-lg-refrigerator-model-number) also requires knowing its specific format.
