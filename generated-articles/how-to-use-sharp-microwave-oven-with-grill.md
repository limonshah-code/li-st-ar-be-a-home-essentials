### How do you use a Sharp microwave oven with grill?

You use a Sharp microwave oven with grill by selecting specific cooking modes. You can choose microwave for rapid heating, grill for browning and crisping, or a combination mode for both. Proper cookware and food placement ensure safe and effective cooking.

## Understanding Your Sharp Microwave Grill's Core Functions

Your Sharp microwave oven with grill offers more than simple reheating. It has distinct cooking modes. Understanding each mode helps you get the best results. Each function serves a different purpose in your kitchen.

First, the basic **microwave mode** heats food quickly. It uses electromagnetic waves to excite water molecules within the food. This creates heat from the inside out. This mode is perfect for defrosting, reheating leftovers, and cooking soft foods like vegetables. You set the power level, usually from 10% to 100%. Higher power heats food faster. Lower power allows more even cooking for dense items, preventing overcooked edges. For example, defrosting meat at 30% power prevents cooking the outside while the inside remains frozen. Using the microwave mode is straightforward for everyday tasks.

Second, the **grill mode** provides direct heat. It uses a heating element, usually at the top of the oven cavity. This element radiates heat downwards onto the food. Grill mode is ideal for browning, crisping, and toasting. Think of cheese on toast, grilled chicken pieces, or even roasting small vegetables. The grill function gives food a crispy exterior that a standard microwave cannot provide. You typically place food on a metal grill rack when using this mode. This rack lifts the food closer to the heating element. It also allows air to circulate around the food, enhancing crispiness. I find this mode excellent for giving leftovers a fresh, just-cooked texture. You can grill fish fillets or toast bread quickly. If your Sharp microwave is not working but has power, first check the mode selection. Issues can arise from improper function selection.

Third, the **combination mode** blends microwave and grill heating. This is where your appliance truly shines. The microwave component cooks the food from the inside, reducing overall cooking time. The grill component simultaneously browns the surface. This dual action gives you cooked food with a desirable crispy or browned exterior. Imagine cooking a lasagna where the pasta cooks through quickly, and the cheese topping gets a golden crust. Or consider roasted potatoes that are tender inside and crispy outside. Many models offer preset combination programs for common foods. These programs automatically adjust the microwave power and grill intensity. Using combination mode saves time compared to separate cooking steps. This mode balances speed and texture. For example, when I cook frozen pizza, I often use a combi setting to ensure the base is cooked and the cheese is melted and bubbly. This versatility makes the Sharp microwave oven with grill a powerful tool in any kitchen.

## Preparing Your Food for Grill and Combination Cooking

Proper food preparation is key when using your Sharp microwave oven with grill. The right methods ensure safety and delicious results. Pay attention to cookware, food placement, and portion sizes.

Choosing the correct **cookware** is very important. For microwave-only cooking, use microwave-safe dishes made of glass, ceramic, or plastic. These materials allow microwaves to pass through them and heat the food. However, when you use the grill or combination mode, metal dishes are often required or recommended. Your Sharp microwave oven with grill typically includes a **metal grill rack**. This rack is designed to be safe for grill mode. It lifts food closer to the grilling element. This promotes better browning and crisping. Never use metal in microwave-only mode, as it can cause sparks and damage the appliance. Always check your appliance manual for specific cookware recommendations. I always double-check my dishes before putting them in, especially when using the grill.

**Food placement** inside the microwave is also vital. When grilling, place the food directly on the metal grill rack. Do not place it on the turntable glass tray alone. The rack ensures the food is close enough to the heating element for effective browning. If your model has a rotating turntable, ensure the rack fits and can turn freely. This allows for even exposure to the grill heat. For larger items, you might need to turn them halfway through cooking. This ensures uniform browning on all sides.

Consider **portion sizes** for optimal grilling. Smaller, thinner pieces of food grill more evenly and quickly. For example, if you are grilling chicken, cut it into thinner cutlets or strips. This prevents the outside from burning before the inside cooks through. Similarly, when grilling vegetables, cut them into uniform pieces. This ensures they cook at the same rate. Overcrowding the grill rack can also lead to uneven cooking. Leave space between food items. This allows heat to circulate freely around each piece. Proper air circulation helps achieve that desired crispy texture.

Preheating the grill element can also improve results. Some Sharp models allow a brief preheat in grill mode. This helps to sear the outside of food quickly. Read your appliance manual for specific preheating instructions. Taking these steps before cooking makes a big difference. It helps your food cook safely and come out perfectly. Remember that using an appliance like a microwave oven with grill requires understanding its features. You can also explore how to use electric oven to grill chicken for comparative techniques, as some principles apply across grilling appliances.

## Grilling with Your Sharp Microwave: Step-by-Step Guide

Using the grill function on your Sharp microwave creates delicious, crispy results. This mode is excellent for browning, toasting, and giving food a satisfying texture. Follow these steps to grill effectively and safely.

**Step 1: Choose the Right Food and Cookware.**
Select foods that benefit from direct heat. These include thin cuts of meat, sausages, bacon, bread, or vegetables like bell peppers and zucchini slices. Always use the metal grill rack that came with your Sharp microwave. Place the rack on the turntable. This elevates the food closer to the grill element. Never use regular microwave-safe plastic or ceramic dishes for grill mode, as they cannot withstand the high heat. I always ensure my grill rack is clean before starting. You might also want to consult guides on how to clean grill pan for general maintenance tips that apply here.

**Step 2: Prepare Your Food.**
Prepare your food by seasoning it as desired. Cut items into uniform, manageable pieces. This helps ensure even cooking and browning. For example, if grilling chicken breasts, butterfly them or cut them into thinner fillets. Arrange the food on the metal grill rack. Leave some space between pieces for better air circulation. This helps achieve an even crisp. For items like bread, you can place them directly on the rack.

**Step 3: Set the Grill Function.**
Close the microwave door. On your Sharp microwave's control panel, find the "Grill" button or "Grill" function. Press it to select grill mode. Your display will typically show "GRILL" or a grill icon. Some models may offer different grill power levels. If so, choose the desired power. For most grilling tasks, full power is common.

**Step 4: Set the Cooking Time.**
Use the numerical keypad or a dial to set your cooking time. Grilling times are usually shorter than microwave cooking times. For example, toast might take 2-3 minutes per side. Chicken pieces might need 10-15 minutes, depending on thickness, with flipping. Start with a shorter time and add more if needed. Monitor your food closely to prevent burning. Grilling can happen quickly.

**Step 5: Start Cooking and Monitor.**
Press the "Start" button to begin grilling. The grill element will glow red, indicating it is heating. It is important to watch your food. Open the door periodically to check its progress. For even browning, flip the food halfway through the cooking time. Use heat-resistant tongs or oven mitts. The inside of the microwave becomes very hot during grilling.

**Step 6: Finish and Serve.**
Once your food reaches the desired level of browning and is cooked through, press "Stop" or "Cancel." Carefully remove the grill rack and food using oven mitts. The rack and oven interior will be hot. Serve your freshly grilled items immediately. This direct heat method gives food a lovely texture that microwave-only cooking cannot replicate.

## Mastering Combination Mode for Optimal Results

The combination mode on your Sharp microwave oven with grill offers the best of both worlds. It cooks food quickly with microwave energy and simultaneously browns or crisps with the grill element. This feature is ideal for dishes needing thorough cooking and a desirable outer texture.

Many Sharp models have preset combination programs. These programs are often labeled for specific foods like pizza, roasted chicken, or baked potatoes. To use a preset, you select the program and enter the food weight. The oven then automatically sets the microwave power and grill intensity. This simplifies cooking complex dishes. If a preset program is not available, you can often manually set the microwave power level and grill time. Your appliance manual provides specific instructions for your model. I find these presets incredibly convenient for common meals. For instance, [how to make pizza in Samsung microwave grill](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-pizza-in-samsung-microwave-grill) shares similar principles for achieving a perfectly cooked pizza with a crispy crust.

When cooking in combination mode, use appropriate cookware. A glass or ceramic dish suitable for microwave and oven use is generally best. The metal grill rack is also essential for combination cooking. It elevates the food, allowing the grill element to reach it effectively for browning. Ensure the dish fits on the rack or is compatible with the oven's interior. Remember to avoid any metal containers that are not explicitly designed for microwave-grill use. This prevents sparking and potential damage.

**Here are examples of dishes that excel in combination mode:**

*   **Roasted Chicken Pieces:** Place chicken pieces on the grill rack in a microwave-safe dish. The microwave quickly cooks the chicken through. The grill simultaneously crisps the skin, giving it a golden-brown finish. This method reduces cooking time significantly compared to a traditional oven.
*   **Au Gratin Dishes:** For dishes like potato gratin or macaroni and cheese, combination mode works wonders. The microwave heats the dish evenly from the inside. The grill melts and browns the cheese topping beautifully. You get a hot, bubbly casserole with a perfect crust.
*   **Baked Potatoes:** Pierce potatoes, place them on the grill rack or in a suitable dish. The microwave part softens the potato flesh quickly. The grill gives the skin a crisp texture, similar to oven-baked potatoes. This is much faster than conventional baking.
*   **Frozen Meals Requiring Browning:** Many frozen convenience foods, like spring rolls or frozen pizzas, benefit greatly. The microwave defrosts and heats the core. The grill crisps the wrapper or crust. This prevents soggy results often seen with microwave-only cooking.

Always monitor food when using combination mode. Some foods may brown faster than they cook through. You might need to adjust cooking times or turn the food. The goal is to achieve both proper internal temperature and desired surface texture. Combining these two heating methods allows for incredible versatility. You can cook a wider range of dishes in less time. This includes making cakes or other baked goods, similar to how [how to use Sharp microwave oven for baking cake](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-sharp-microwave-oven-for-baking-cake) outlines for Sharp models. This mode is a true time-saver for busy kitchens.

This is paramount. Never use metal dishes or aluminum foil in microwave-only mode. Metal can cause dangerous arcing (sparks) that damage the oven. For grill and combination modes, use only the metal grill rack provided by Sharp. Also, ensure any additional dishes are explicitly labeled as "microwave-safe" and "oven-safe." Glass, ceramic, and certain plastics are suitable for microwaving. For grilling, heat-resistant glass or ceramic is usually fine if placed under the grill rack, but never directly touching the element. Always consult your appliance manual for specific cookware recommendations. I always check the dish's label to be certain.

**2. Prevent Overheating and Superheating:**
Liquids, especially water, can superheat in a microwave. This means they heat beyond their boiling point without bubbling. When disturbed, they can erupt violently. To avoid this, place a non-metallic spoon or stirring stick in the liquid before heating. This provides a surface for bubbles to form. Always be careful when removing hot liquids from the microwave. Allow a few seconds for cooling before handling. Also, do not run the microwave empty. This can damage internal components.

**3. Ensure Proper Ventilation:**
Microwaves generate heat and steam. Adequate ventilation is crucial. Do not block the air vents on your Sharp microwave. Vents are usually located on the back, sides, or top. Blocking them can lead to overheating and reduced performance. Ensure there is enough space around the appliance for air to circulate freely. Check your manual for specific clearance requirements. Poor ventilation can also cause issues like your [why does my sharp microwave keep shutting off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-sharp-microwave-keep-shutting-off), as a safety mechanism.

**4. Avoid Overcooking and Burning:**
Monitor your food, especially in grill and combination modes. Grilling can quickly lead to burning if unattended. Use shorter cooking times and check progress frequently. Always set a timer. If you see smoke or sparks, immediately turn off the microwave and unplug it. Do not open the door until the smoke clears. Overcooking certain foods can also pose a fire risk. For instance, popcorn can easily burn if cooked too long.

**5. Clean Regularly and Properly:**
Food splatters can accumulate inside the microwave. These can absorb microwave energy and cause localized overheating or even fires. Clean your microwave regularly, especially after using the grill function. Food residue on the grill element can smoke and smell. Use appropriate cleaning solutions and follow cleaning instructions in your manual. I make sure to wipe down the interior after any greasy cooking.

**6. Keep an Eye on Children:**
Do not allow children to operate the microwave unsupervised. Teach them about safe use, especially regarding hot food and steam. Position the microwave at a height that is easy for adults to reach but difficult for small children to interfere with.

**7. Do Not Tamper with the Door or Latch:**
The microwave door is a critical safety feature. It prevents microwave energy from escaping. If the door seal is damaged, or the latch does not close properly, do not use the oven. Contact a qualified service technician for repairs. Never try to fix the door yourself. This includes problems like [why does my sharp microwave just stopped working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-sharp-microwave-just-stopped-working) or issues with the door mechanism.

## Advanced Cooking Techniques with Your Sharp Combi Oven

Your Sharp microwave oven with grill is more than just a simple kitchen appliance. It is a combi oven that allows for diverse cooking methods. Understanding advanced techniques can elevate your home cooking. This helps you get the most out of your investment.

**1. Sequential Cooking for Perfect Roasts:**
Consider cooking a small roast, like a chicken or a pork loin. Start with the microwave-only function for a short period. This quickly pre-cooks the interior. Then, switch to the combination mode. This cooks the meat thoroughly while simultaneously browning the exterior. You can also use the grill-only mode at the very end. This delivers a crispy, golden-brown skin. This method drastically cuts down on traditional oven cooking times. For example, a small chicken might cook in 30-40 minutes instead of 1 hour or more. This type of combined cooking saves energy and time.

**2. Crisping Up Reheated Foods:**
Reheating leftovers in a regular microwave often results in soggy food. Your Sharp combi oven solves this problem. Use the combination mode to reheat items like pizza, fried chicken, or pastries. The microwave part warms the food through. The grill part restores the crispiness of the crust or skin. This makes leftovers taste much better. I often use this for day-old fries; they come out surprisingly crispy.

**3. Achieving Oven-Like Baking Results:**
While a dedicated oven is best for large-scale baking, your Sharp combi oven can handle smaller baking tasks. You can bake muffins, small cakes, or even cookies. Use the combination mode, focusing on a higher microwave power and lower grill intensity, or vice versa, depending on the recipe. Some models even have a convection
