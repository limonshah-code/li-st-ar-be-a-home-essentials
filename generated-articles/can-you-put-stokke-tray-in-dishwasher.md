### Can You Put Stokke Tray In Dishwasher?

Yes, most Stokke high chair trays are dishwasher safe. You should place the tray on the top rack of your dishwasher. Use a mild dishwashing detergent. Avoid high heat settings, as extreme temperatures can damage the plastic over time. Always refer to your specific Stokke product manual for precise care instructions.

### Understanding Stokke Tray Materials and Dishwasher Compatibility

Stokke high chairs, like the popular Tripp Trapp, use durable, high-quality plastics for their trays. These materials resist stains and wear from daily use. They are usually made from polypropylene (PP) plastic. Polypropylene is a common choice for baby products. This material is known for its safety and resistance to chemicals.

The choice of material affects how you clean the tray. Not all plastics are safe for dishwashers. Some plastics melt or warp under high heat. Stokke designs its trays with dishwasher safety in mind. This design helps parents keep things clean easily. Understanding these materials helps you clean without worry.

When you think about putting a Stokke tray in the dishwasher, material is key. The PP plastic used is generally heat-resistant. This means it can withstand the temperatures found in most dishwashers. However, constant exposure to very high temperatures can still cause issues. Over time, plastic can degrade or lose its shape. It is important to know your dishwasher settings.

You should always verify the specific model's instructions. While most trays are similar, slight variations exist. Checking the manual provides the most accurate information. This step ensures you protect your investment. You maintain the tray's appearance and function.

### Stokke Tripp Trapp Tray: Dishwasher Safety Guidelines

The Stokke Tripp Trapp high chair is a popular choice for families. Its tray is designed for convenience and safety. Official Stokke guidelines confirm that the Tripp Trapp tray is dishwasher safe. This news makes cleaning much simpler for busy parents. You can enjoy less time scrubbing and more time with your child.

To ensure proper care, always place the tray on the top rack of your dishwasher. The top rack typically uses lower heat than the bottom rack. This lower heat helps prevent damage to plastic items. High heat can lead to warping or cracking of the tray material. You want to keep the tray in perfect condition for years.

Stokke recommends using a mild dishwashing detergent. Harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners are not good for the tray. These products can scratch the surface or cause discoloration. A gentle cycle is also preferable if your dishwasher offers one. This approach protects the tray's finish. It also prolongs its life.

Proper loading is also important. Ensure the tray does not block spray arms or other items. This prevents poor cleaning and potential damage. Remove any large food pieces before loading the tray. This step prevents clogging your dishwasher. It makes the cleaning process more effective. Knowing how to correctly [remove the tray from the Stokke high chair](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-tray-from-stokke-high-chair) is the first step before any cleaning method, including dishwashing.

### Optimal Dishwasher Settings for Your Stokke Tray

Choosing the right dishwasher settings makes a big difference. For your Stokke tray, mild settings are always best. I recommend a delicate or eco-friendly cycle. These cycles often use lower temperatures and less aggressive washing. They help protect plastic items from damage. You want to avoid any settings that use extremely hot water or intense drying cycles.

Temperatures up to 70°C (158°F) are generally safe for Stokke trays. Many dishwashers have a sanitize or high-temp wash option. You should avoid these for plastic items like the Stokke tray. Over time, high heat can make the plastic brittle. It can also cause permanent warping, which affects how the tray fits. You also want to keep the tray looking new.

When you load the tray, position it carefully. Place it on the top rack. Ensure it sits securely and cannot move around during the wash cycle. Movement can lead to scratches or damage. Avoid overcrowding the dishwasher. This allows water and detergent to reach all surfaces of the tray. Proper placement ensures a thorough clean.

After the wash cycle finishes, you can air dry the tray. Or, you can use a low-heat drying cycle if your dishwasher has one. Many modern dishwashers offer an air-dry option. This option uses no heat for drying. This is the safest way to dry plastic items. You help preserve the tray's integrity for longer use. Understanding these settings ensures your tray stays safe and clean. You may wonder if you can put other plastic items, like a [baking tray in the dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-a-baking-tray-in-the-dishwasher), and similar rules often apply to preserve their longevity.

### Manual Cleaning: When Hand Washing Your Stokke Tray is Best

Sometimes, hand washing your Stokke tray is the best option. This is especially true if you only have a small mess. Or, if your dishwasher is full. Hand washing gives you control over the cleaning process. It can also be gentler on the tray's material. You can choose to hand wash anytime for quick clean-ups.

To hand wash effectively, start with warm water and a mild dish soap. Use a soft sponge or cloth. Gently wipe down all surfaces of the tray. Pay attention to corners and edges where food might collect. You want to remove all food residues. This prevents bacteria growth. I always make sure to get into all the nooks.

For stubborn stains, you can let the tray soak for a few minutes. A mixture of warm water and a little baking soda often works wonders. This natural cleaner helps lift dried food without harsh chemicals. After soaking, gently scrub the area. Rinse the tray thoroughly under running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone.

Air drying the tray is ideal after hand washing. You can also dry it with a clean towel. This prevents water spots and ensures the tray is ready for the next meal. Hand washing is a great way to extend the life of your Stokke tray. It also gives you peace of mind about its cleanliness.
