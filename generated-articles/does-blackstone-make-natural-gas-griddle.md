## The Truth About Blackstone and Natural Gas Conversions

The idea of a Blackstone griddle running on natural gas is appealing to many. The convenience of an unlimited fuel supply directly from your home is hard to beat. The truth is, while Blackstone does not sell griddles specifically built for natural gas, conversion is often possible. Many Blackstone propane griddles are "natural gas convertible." This means they can operate on natural gas with the right modifications. You cannot simply connect a propane griddle to a natural gas line. The two fuel types require different pressure and orifice sizes.

Natural gas operates at a much lower pressure than propane. This difference requires a specific natural gas regulator and new burner orifices. Propane orifices are smaller to handle the higher pressure of propane. Natural gas orifices are larger to allow for the greater volume of gas needed. Failing to change these parts can result in poor performance or even unsafe conditions. Your griddle will either not heat up properly or could pose a fire hazard.

To facilitate these conversions, third-party manufacturers offer natural gas conversion kits. These kits typically include the necessary regulator and orifices. They are designed to match the specific BTU output of your Blackstone griddle model. It is crucial to choose a kit that is compatible with your exact griddle. Using the wrong kit can compromise safety and cooking efficiency. Always verify the kit's compatibility before purchasing.

I have seen many people successfully convert their Blackstone griddles. They enjoy the benefits of a continuous natural gas supply. This eliminates the need for propane tank swaps. However, the conversion process requires careful attention to detail and safety. We will discuss this process in more detail soon. Remember, while not factory-direct, a natural gas Blackstone griddle is achievable through conversion.

Converting your Blackstone griddle to natural gas is a popular solution for home use. It offers the benefit of a continuous fuel supply without tank refills. This process involves replacing specific components of your griddle. The goal is to adapt it from propane's high pressure to natural gas's lower pressure. You will need a natural gas conversion kit designed for your specific Blackstone model. These kits are often available from third-party suppliers.

A typical natural gas conversion kit includes several key parts. First, it contains a natural gas regulator. This regulator reduces the incoming natural gas pressure to the correct operating pressure for the griddle. Second, the kit includes new burner orifices. These small brass fittings regulate the gas flow into each burner. Natural gas orifices have larger openings than propane orifices. This allows more gas to flow at the lower pressure, ensuring proper heat output. Some kits also include a longer gas hose for connecting to your home's natural gas line.

The conversion process itself usually involves removing the griddle top and accessing the burner assembly. You will need to carefully unscrew the existing propane orifices. Then, you screw in the new, larger natural gas orifices. Next, you remove the propane regulator and attach the natural gas regulator. It is important to ensure all connections are tight and secure. You must also perform a leak test after installation. This involves applying a soapy water solution to all gas connections. Look for bubbles, which indicate a leak. If you see bubbles, tighten the connection or re-seal it.

*   **Key Steps for Conversion:**
    1.  **Purchase the Correct Kit:** Ensure the natural gas conversion kit matches your Blackstone griddle model.
    2.  **Disconnect Propane:** Turn off the propane tank and disconnect the hose.

Remember to always follow the kit's instructions and local codes.

## Blackstone Griddles: Designed Primarily for Propane Convenience

Blackstone griddles are synonymous with outdoor cooking convenience. A significant part of this convenience stems from their primary design for propane fuel. Propane offers a highly portable and efficient energy source. This makes Blackstone griddles suitable for a wide range of activities. Whether you're tailgating, camping, or simply moving your cooking station around the backyard, propane is ideal. You can easily connect a standard 20-pound propane tank. This tank typically provides hours of cooking power.

The engineering behind Blackstone griddles reflects this propane-centric approach. Burners, regulators, and hoses are all factory-tuned for optimal performance with propane. The high pressure of liquid propane allows for smaller orifices. These create a powerful, concentrated flame. This design ensures quick heating and consistent temperatures across the large cooking surface. This consistency is crucial for achieving perfect sears on meats or evenly cooking a batch of pancakes.

Many users appreciate the simplicity of propane. When a tank runs low, you can quickly swap it for a full one. This avoids interruptions during a large gathering. The widespread availability of propane refills also adds to its appeal. You can find propane at almost any grocery store, hardware store, or gas station. This ease of access ensures your griddle is always ready for action.

While natural gas conversions are possible, understanding the propane-first design is important. It explains why dedicated natural gas models from Blackstone are rare. The company focuses on a product that maximizes portability and ease of use for the average consumer. This core design principle helps Blackstone maintain its strong position in the outdoor griddle market. It provides a reliable and accessible cooking solution for countless homes.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Natural Gas for Griddles

Switching to natural gas for your griddle offers a different set of benefits and drawbacks compared to propane. Understanding these can help you decide if conversion is right for your home. I have seen many people weigh these points carefully before making a change.

### Pros of Natural Gas

Natural gas provides unparalleled convenience. Imagine never having to check a propane tank gauge again. You get an endless fuel supply directly from your home's gas line. This eliminates the need for refills or swapping tanks. For outdoor kitchens or fixed cooking stations, this is a huge advantage. Natural gas is also generally cheaper than propane when calculated per BTU. Over time, this can lead to cost savings, especially if you cook outdoors frequently.

Another benefit is environmental. Natural gas burns cleaner than propane. It produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions. This makes it a slightly more eco-friendly choice. The consistent pressure from a natural gas line also ensures steady heat. You won't experience the flame weakening as a tank empties. This reliability is excellent for long cooking sessions or large meals.

### Cons of Natural Gas

The biggest disadvantage of natural gas is its lack of portability. Once connected to a natural gas line, your griddle becomes a stationary appliance. You cannot easily move it for camping trips or tailgating events. This loss of flexibility is a significant consideration for many Blackstone owners. The initial setup cost can also be higher. You might need to install a new gas line to your outdoor cooking area. This requires professional installation and permits.

Safety is another key factor. Working with natural gas lines requires expertise. Improper installation can lead to leaks, which are very dangerous. It's crucial to have a certified technician handle the installation and conversion. The heat output of natural gas can sometimes be slightly lower than propane for an equivalently sized burner. This is due to natural gas having a lower BTU per cubic foot. You might notice a slight difference in heating speed or maximum temperature. While often negligible, some serious cooks might find it noticeable. Despite these drawbacks, the convenience often outweighs them for dedicated outdoor kitchen setups.

## Safety Considerations for Natural Gas Griddles

Safety is paramount when dealing with any gas appliance. This is especially true when converting a griddle to natural gas. Natural gas, while common and safe when handled properly, requires careful attention. Incorrect installation or maintenance can lead to serious hazards. I always stress the importance of following strict safety protocols. Your home and family's well-being depend on it.

The primary concern with natural gas is the risk of leaks. Natural gas is odorless in its natural state. Gas companies add a chemical called mercaptan to give it a distinct rotten egg smell. This helps detect leaks. If you ever smell gas, turn off the supply immediately and evacuate the area. Do not use any electrical switches or open flames. Call your gas company or emergency services from a safe distance.

Proper ventilation is also crucial. Griddles should always be used outdoors in a well-ventilated area. Never use a gas griddle indoors or in enclosed spaces. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas produced by incomplete combustion. It can be fatal if inhaled in sufficient quantities. Ensure your griddle has plenty of fresh air circulation during operation.

Professional installation of the natural gas line and conversion kit is highly recommended. A licensed gas technician understands local codes and safety regulations. They will ensure all connections are secure, pressure is correct, and the system is leak-free. Attempting complex gas line work yourself without proper training or tools can be extremely dangerous. This is not a DIY project for beginners.

*   **Key Safety Practices:**
    *   **Always Leak Test:** Use soapy water on all gas connections after installation or component changes.
    *   **Ensure Ventilation:** Operate griddles only outdoors or in very well-ventilated areas.
    *   **Never Use Indoors:** Gas griddles are not for indoor use due to carbon monoxide risk.
    *   **Monitor for Gas Odor:** Be aware of the "rotten egg" smell; it indicates a leak.
    *   **Professional Installation:** Hire a licensed gas technician for line installation and conversion.
    *   **Read Manuals:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for your griddle and conversion kit.
    *   **Regular Inspections:** Periodically check hoses and connections for wear or damage.

Proper maintenance also plays a role in safety. Regularly inspect your gas hose for cracks or fraying. Make sure the regulator is free from debris. A well-maintained griddle is a safer griddle.

Understanding these core features highlights why Blackstone is a top choice for outdoor cooking enthusiasts.

### Durable Cooking Surfaces

One of the most defining features of a Blackstone griddle is its rolled steel cooking surface. This heavy-gauge steel provides excellent heat retention and distribution. Once seasoned, this surface becomes naturally non-stick, making cooking and cleaning easier. The robust construction ensures durability, allowing the griddle to withstand high temperatures and frequent use. This material choice is what gives Blackstone griddles their signature performance. You can cook delicate items like eggs or sear thick cuts of meat with confidence. Learning [how to prep your Blackstone griddle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-prep-blackstone-griddle) properly is essential for maximizing this feature.

The substantial thickness of the griddle top also helps minimize hot spots. Heat spreads evenly across the entire surface. This allows you to cook different foods at varying temperatures simultaneously. For example, you can have a high heat zone for searing and a lower heat zone for warming. This versatility is a major advantage for preparing complex meals outdoors. Proper care, including regular seasoning, helps maintain the integrity of this surface.

### Efficient Heat Distribution

Blackstone griddles feature multiple independently controlled burners. These burners are positioned strategically beneath the griddle top. This design allows for precise temperature management across different cooking zones. Each burner has its own control knob, letting you create distinct heat areas. This is incredibly useful when cooking multiple items that require different temperatures. For instance, you can keep pancakes warm on one side while frying bacon on the other.

The powerful burners deliver significant BTU output. This ensures quick preheating and recovery times. Even after adding a large amount of cold food, the griddle quickly regains its cooking temperature. This efficiency is critical for outdoor cooking where maintaining consistent heat can be challenging. The flame spread and burner design are optimized to cover the entire griddle plate. This eliminates cold spots and ensures uniform cooking results. Whether you're using propane or natural gas, the core design delivers this reliable heat performance.

### Portability and Design

Even large Blackstone griddles often incorporate elements of portability. Many models include sturdy caster wheels. These wheels allow you to move the griddle around your patio or deck with ease. While a natural gas conversion limits its long-distance portability, the local mobility remains. The overall design prioritizes user experience. Side shelves provide ample prep space for ingredients and tools. A front-mounted grease management system simplifies cleanup.

Many models also feature integrated storage shelves or cabinets. These areas keep propane tanks out of sight or store accessories. The sturdy frame construction provides a stable cooking platform. This stability is important for safety and comfortable operation. Whether you choose a 28-inch model or a large 36-inch, the thoughtful design caters to practical outdoor cooking needs. These design elements enhance the cooking experience regardless of the fuel type being used.

## Choosing the Right Griddle Fuel for Your Needs

Deciding between propane and natural gas for your griddle depends entirely on your lifestyle and cooking habits. Each fuel type offers distinct advantages. I have helped many friends consider these options to find their perfect outdoor cooking setup. It truly comes down to what you prioritize in your outdoor kitchen.

If flexibility and mobility are your top concerns, propane is the clear winner. Propane-powered griddles are designed to be moved. You can take them to tailgates, camping trips, or even just rearrange your backyard setup. The standard 20-pound propane tank offers hours of cooking and is easily refilled or exchanged. This makes propane ideal for those who value versatility. You can also [connect a propane tank to your Blackstone griddle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-connect-propane-tank-to-blackstone-griddle) with ease.

On the other hand, if you envision a fixed outdoor kitchen or cook frequently in one spot, natural gas might be more appealing. The convenience of an endless fuel supply cannot be overstated. No more running out of gas in the middle of a big family meal. Natural gas also tends to be cheaper per BTU, offering long-term savings for heavy users. This makes it a compelling choice for a permanent setup. However, remember the griddle will be stationary once connected.

Consider the initial setup. For natural gas, you might need to install a dedicated gas line to your outdoor area. This often requires professional help and can be a significant upfront investment. Propane griddles, however, simply need a propane tank. This makes them much quicker and easier to get up and running. Think about how often you cook and how much you value the "set it and forget it" aspect of a direct gas line.

Ultimately, there is no single "best" fuel type. It's about matching the fuel to your specific cooking environment and preferences. Evaluate your outdoor space, your budget, and how you plan to use your griddle. This will guide you to the fuel choice that best suits your home cooking needs.

After cleaning, always reapply a thin layer of cooking oil. This step is essential for seasoning and protecting the griddle surface. The oil creates a non-stick layer and acts as a barrier against moisture. This prevents rust, especially in humid environments. A properly seasoned surface also improves the flavor of your food over time. Never use harsh soaps or abrasive cleaners on the cooking surface, as they can strip the seasoning.

### Protecting Against Rust

Rust is the archenemy of any cast iron or steel griddle surface. Protecting your griddle from rust requires consistent effort. The seasoning layer is your first line of defense. Ensure it is always intact and well-oiled. After every cleaning, apply that thin layer of oil. This seals the surface from moisture.

Store your griddle in a dry location whenever possible. If your griddle lives outdoors, invest in a high-quality cover. A good cover protects against rain, dew, and other environmental elements. Make sure the cover fits snugly and completely covers the griddle top. Even a small amount of exposure to moisture can lead to rust development. If you notice any rust spots appearing, address them immediately. You can typically remove light rust with a griddle brick or steel wool. Re-season the affected area thoroughly afterward. This diligent care will help prevent your [Blackstone griddle from rusting](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-blackstone-griddle-rust).

Regularly check the gas lines and connections for any signs of wear, cracks, or leaks. For natural gas setups, ensure the hose is not kinked or abraded. Make sure the regulator is clean and free of obstructions. These checks contribute to both the longevity of your griddle and your safety. By following these simple maintenance tips, your gas-powered Blackstone griddle will provide years of delicious meals.

## Connecting Your Griddle to a Natural Gas Line

Connecting a converted Blackstone griddle to a natural gas line is a critical step. It requires precision and adherence to safety standards. This process ensures a consistent and safe fuel supply for your outdoor cooking. I cannot stress enough the importance of doing this correctly or hiring a professional.

First, identify the natural gas connection point on your property. This is usually an existing stub-out line or a new line installed specifically for your outdoor kitchen. The connection point should have a shut-off valve. This valve allows you to control the gas flow to your griddle. Ensure the valve is easily accessible in case of an emergency.

You will need a natural gas hose designed for outdoor appliance use. This hose must be rated for natural gas pressure and outdoor exposure. It typically has a quick-connect fitting on one end. This fitting allows for easy attachment and detachment of your griddle. The other end connects to your home's natural gas supply line. The length of the hose is important. It should be long enough to position your griddle comfortably. It should not be so long that it becomes a tripping hazard.

Before making any connections, ensure the main gas supply to your home is off. This prevents gas leaks during the installation. Apply a gas-rated pipe sealant or Teflon tape to all threaded connections. This creates a tight seal and prevents leaks. Connect one end of the natural gas hose to the griddle's regulator. Connect the other end to your home's gas line stub-out. Hand-tighten all connections first, then use a wrench to snug them up. Be careful not to overtighten, which can strip threads.

Once all connections are made, slowly turn the main gas supply back on. Then, immediately perform a leak test using soapy water. Spray the solution on all connections you just made. Look for bubbles forming, which indicate a gas leak. If you see bubbles, turn off the gas, tighten the connection, and retest. Repeat until no bubbles appear. Only then is it safe to light your griddle. If you are unsure at any point, do not hesitate to call a licensed gas technician. Their expertise ensures a safe and reliable connection for your [natural gas griddle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-natural-gas-stoves-work).
