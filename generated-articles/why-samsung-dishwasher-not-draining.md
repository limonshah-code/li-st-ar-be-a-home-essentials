## Samsung Dishwasher Not Draining? Fix It Now!

Few things are as frustrating as opening your dishwasher after a cycle, only to find standing water at the bottom. When your Samsung dishwasher is not draining, it can disrupt your kitchen routine and leave you with dirty dishes. I understand how much you rely on this appliance to keep your home running smoothly. This common issue often has a simple solution.

This guide explores the most frequent reasons your Samsung dishwasher might not drain. We will cover blockages in filters, issues with the drain hose, problems with the air gap, and even drain pump failures. You will learn actionable steps to diagnose and fix these problems yourself. By the end, you will have a clear path to getting your Samsung dishwasher back to its best.

### Takeaway

If your Samsung dishwasher is not draining, start by checking these common causes:

*   **Clear the filter:** Remove and clean the filter assembly at the bottom of the dishwasher.
*   **Inspect the drain hose:** Look for kinks or blockages in the hose behind the appliance.
*   **Check the air gap/disposal:** Ensure your air gap is clear and the garbage disposal is empty if connected.
*   **Listen to the drain pump:** A humming sound without water movement suggests a pump issue.

When your Samsung dishwasher does not drain, it usually means something blocks the water flow or the pump fails to push water out. Common culprits include clogged filters, kinked drain hoses, issues with the air gap or garbage disposal connection, or a faulty drain pump. Addressing these points often resolves the problem.

## Understanding Your Samsung Dishwasher's Drain System

Your Samsung dishwasher performs a vital role in cleaning dishes, and its ability to drain water properly is key to this process. It uses a specific system to remove dirty water after each wash cycle. Understanding how this system works helps you identify what goes wrong when your Samsung dishwasher is not draining. Water moves from the tub, through a filter, into a sump, and then the drain pump pushes it out through a hose.

When your dishwasher works correctly, the drain cycle begins after the final rinse. The drain pump activates, pulling water from the bottom of the wash tub. This water then travels through the drain hose, often leading to a garbage disposal or a separate air gap before entering your home's main drain line. Any interruption in this flow causes water to remain in the tub.

### The Filter Assembly

At the bottom of your Samsung dishwasher, you will find a filter assembly. This filter catches food particles and debris, stopping them from entering the drain pump and drain line. If this filter gets clogged with food scraps, it restricts water from reaching the pump. Water cannot exit the dishwasher, leading to pooling. Regular cleaning of this filter is essential for proper drainage.

### The Drain Pump

The drain pump is a motor-driven device located at the base of the dishwasher. Its job is to forcefully push the dirty water out of the appliance. When the pump motor runs, an impeller spins, creating the pressure needed to expel water. If the pump fails due to a blockage in the impeller or an electrical issue, the dishwasher cannot drain. A humming sound without water movement often indicates a blocked or failing pump.

### The Drain Hose and Air Gap

The drain hose carries the water from the dishwasher pump to your home's drain. This hose can become kinked behind the dishwasher or under the sink, stopping water flow. Sometimes, food debris or grease can build up inside the hose, creating a blockage. Many installations also use an air gap, a small cylindrical device on the countertop, or connect the drain hose directly to a garbage disposal. Both components need to be clear for successful drainage.

## Clogged Filters and Sumps: A Primary Culprit

When your Samsung dishwasher is not draining, a clogged filter is often the simplest and most common reason. Over time, food particles, grease, and debris accumulate in the dishwasher's filter assembly. This buildup prevents water from passing through to the drain pump, leaving standing water in the tub. Cleaning this component is usually a straightforward task you can do yourself.

The filter system in Samsung dishwashers often includes a cylindrical filter and a flat mesh filter. Both work together to trap debris. If either of these components becomes blocked, water cannot flow freely out of the wash tub during the drain cycle. This blockage is a common cause for water pooling at the bottom of your dishwasher. It makes sense to check the filter first when you see drainage issues.

Regular maintenance of your dishwasher filter helps prevent drainage problems. I recommend checking and cleaning it once a month, or more often if you frequently wash dishes with heavy food residue. This simple step can save you from more complex repairs later on. Neglecting the filter can lead to persistent drainage issues and unpleasant odors inside the appliance.

### How to Inspect and Clean Your Samsung Dishwasher Filter

Cleaning your Samsung dishwasher filter is a quick process. First, make sure the dishwasher is off and cool. Open the dishwasher door and locate the filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. It typically consists of two parts: a cylindrical micro-filter and a coarse filter screen. You can usually twist and lift the cylindrical filter out. The flat screen underneath might also lift out, depending on your model.

Once removed, rinse both filter parts thoroughly under warm running water. Use a soft brush or sponge to gently scrub away any food debris, grease, or grime stuck to the mesh. For stubborn residue, you can use a mild dish soap. Make sure to remove all visible particles. A clean filter allows water to flow freely, which is essential for proper drainage. For more detailed steps on maintaining this crucial component, you can refer to guides on [How to Clean Your Samsung Dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-samsung-dishwasher).

### Checking the Sump Area

After removing the filters, you will see the sump area. This is the basin where water collects before being pumped out. Sometimes, small pieces of glass, bones, or other hard objects can fall past the filter and settle in the sump or near the drain pump impeller. Use a flashlight to carefully inspect this area for any foreign objects.

If you find anything, use pliers or tweezers to remove it carefully. Be gentle to avoid damaging the components. Even a small item can prevent the drain pump from operating correctly, causing your Samsung dishwasher not to drain. Clearing the sump ensures nothing obstructs the water path to the drain pump.

## Inspecting the Drain Hose for Kinks or Blockages

After checking the filter, your next step should be to examine the drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your home's drain system, often connecting to a garbage disposal or a separate drain pipe. This hose is a common point for problems when your Samsung dishwasher is not draining. Issues with the hose can be either physical kinks or internal blockages.

A kink in the drain hose restricts the flow of water, preventing it from leaving the dishwasher. This is a simple fix if you can easily access the hose. Internal blockages are more complex. Food particles, grease, or even mold can build up inside the hose over time, narrowing the path for water. If the hose is clogged, the pump will struggle to push water out, or it will fail entirely.

Always disconnect power to your dishwasher before checking the drain hose. This ensures your safety while you work. You might need to pull the dishwasher out from its cavity to fully inspect the hose. Be careful not to damage the floor or the water lines during this process.

### External Kinks

Start by visually inspecting the entire length of the drain hose. This hose typically runs from the back of the dishwasher to the sink drain or garbage disposal. Check behind the dishwasher and under the sink cabinet. Look for any sharp bends or kinks in the hose. If you find one, gently straighten it out. Ensure the hose has a gradual slope downwards, without any dips where water could settle and create an airlock.

A common place for kinks is where the hose connects to the plumbing under the sink or if the dishwasher was pushed back against the wall too hard during installation. Sometimes, moving the dishwasher slightly can fix a kink. Ensure the hose has enough slack without being too loose. A hose that is too long might also sag, leading to water pooling inside it.

### Internal Obstructions

If there are no visible kinks, an internal blockage is likely. This is more challenging to address. You will need to disconnect the drain hose from both ends: the dishwasher side and the sink/disposal side. Have a bucket ready, as residual water might spill out. Once disconnected, you can try to flush the hose with water from a garden hose or faucet to dislodge any blockages.

If flushing does not work, you can use a plumber's snake or a long, flexible brush to clear the obstruction. Push the tool through the hose carefully to break up any buildup. Be gentle to avoid puncturing the hose. Once you believe it is clear, reattach the hose securely to both ends. Make sure all connections are tight to prevent leaks. Run a test cycle to confirm the drainage issue is resolved.

### Proper Hose Installation

Proper drain hose installation is vital for preventing future drainage problems. Ensure the drain hose connects to a dedicated drain or an air gap. If connecting to a garbage disposal, make sure the knock-out plug inside the disposal inlet has been removed. Many new disposals come with this plug intact, and forgetting to remove it will completely block drainage.

Also, create a "high loop" with the drain hose. This means routing the hose up to the underside of the countertop before it descends to the drain connection. This high loop prevents dirty water from the sink or disposal from flowing back into the dishwasher. It also helps prevent siphoning, which could cause the dishwasher to drain prematurely. A properly installed hose will prevent your Samsung dishwasher from having future draining issues.

## Addressing Air Gap and Garbage Disposal Issues

For many homes, the Samsung dishwasher's drain hose connects to either an air gap on the countertop or directly to a garbage disposal unit. Both of these connections can cause drainage problems if they are blocked or improperly set up. If your Samsung dishwasher is not draining, checking these components is a crucial step. They are often overlooked but can be the source of your frustration.

The air gap prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into your clean dishwasher. It creates a physical break in the drain line. The garbage disposal grinds down food waste, but if it is full or clogged, it can block the dishwasher's drainage path. Understanding how these parts work with your dishwasher helps you troubleshoot effectively.

Always turn off the power to both your dishwasher and your garbage disposal before inspecting these connections. This ensures your safety while you work. You might need a flashlight to see clearly inside the disposal connection.

### What is an Air Gap?

An air gap is a small, cylindrical device usually found on your kitchen countertop, near the faucet. It has two hose connections underneath: one from the dishwasher's drain pump and another going to the garbage disposal or a separate drain. Its purpose is to prevent contaminated sink water from siphoning back into the dishwasher. If the air gap gets clogged, water can back up into the dishwasher or overflow from the air gap itself.

To check the air gap, first remove its cap, which usually just twists or pulls off. Look for any debris, such as food particles or mineral deposits, inside the cylinder. Use a small brush or a paperclip to clear any blockages you find. Also, ensure the hoses connected to the air gap are clear. If you see water overflowing from the air gap during a drain cycle, it definitely indicates a clog in the air gap or the hose leading from it to the disposal/drain.

### Garbage Disposal Connection

If your Samsung dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, the disposal unit itself must be clear for the dishwasher to drain properly. A full or clogged garbage disposal can prevent water from leaving the dishwasher tub. Run your garbage disposal for about 30 seconds with cold water to ensure it is completely empty and clear of food waste. Sometimes, simply running the disposal fixes the drainage issue.

Another common problem occurs during initial installation of a new garbage disposal. Many disposal units come with a "knock-out plug" in the dishwasher inlet port. This plug must be removed before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. If the plug is still in place, water cannot enter the disposal from the dishwasher. To check, disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Look inside the disposal's inlet port for a plastic plug. If present, carefully knock it out with a screwdriver and hammer. Remember to reconnect the hose securely afterward.

## Troubleshooting the Drain Pump

When your Samsung dishwasher is not draining, and you have ruled out common clogs in the filter, hose, air gap, and disposal, the drain pump often becomes the prime suspect. The drain pump is the motor that forces water out of the dishwasher. If it fails, water simply sits in the tub. A faulty drain pump can manifest in several ways, from making unusual noises to no noise at all.

Diagnosing a drain pump issue usually involves listening for sounds and inspecting the impeller for obstructions. The pump might be humming but not moving water, which suggests a blockage. Or, it might be completely silent, indicating an electrical issue or a burnt-out motor. While checking for obstructions is a DIY task, replacing a drain pump is more complex and often requires a professional technician.

Always turn off the power to your dishwasher at the circuit breaker before you begin any inspection of the drain pump. This is crucial for your safety. You will need to access the pump, which is usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher, often from the front or underneath.

### Signs of a Faulty Drain Pump

You can often identify a faulty drain pump by listening to your dishwasher during the drain cycle. If you hear a low humming sound, but no water is draining, the pump motor is likely running but its impeller is jammed. This jam could be from a piece of glass, a broken dish fragment, or a bone. If you hear no sound at all during the drain cycle, the pump might not be receiving power, or its motor has failed completely.

Another sign of a pump issue is an incomplete drain. The dishwasher drains some water but leaves a small puddle. This can mean the pump is weak or only partially obstructed. If you notice these symptoms after checking all other simple causes, the drain pump is likely the problem. Knowing these signs helps you decide your next steps.

### Checking for Obstructions in the Pump Impeller

To inspect the drain pump impeller, you first need to remove any standing water from the dishwasher tub. You can use towels or a wet vacuum for this. Then, remove the filter assembly and the sump cover to access the pump area. The impeller is usually a small fan-like component. Carefully feel around the impeller for any foreign objects that might be jamming it. You might need to reach in with your fingers or use pliers to pull out debris.

Be cautious when reaching into the pump area, as sharp objects might be present. Once you clear any obstructions, manually spin the impeller to ensure it moves freely. If it spins smoothly, reassemble the filters and sump cover, then run a test cycle. If the dishwasher still does not drain, and the pump is humming or silent, the pump motor itself might be defective and require replacement. This is a job often best left to a qualified appliance repair technician due to the electrical and plumbing connections involved.

## Faulty Check Valve and Other Electrical Glitches

Sometimes, when your Samsung dishwasher is not draining, the issue extends beyond simple clogs or a failing drain pump. Less common but equally disruptive causes can include a faulty check valve or various electrical glitches affecting the drain cycle. These problems can be harder to diagnose without specialized knowledge, but understanding them helps you narrow down possibilities.

The check valve ensures water only flows one way out of the dishwasher. If it sticks or breaks, water can flow back in. Electrical problems, like issues with the control board or wiring, can prevent the drain pump from receiving power. These situations often require more detailed troubleshooting. It is important to know when to call a professional for these complex repairs.

Always disconnect the dishwasher from its power source before attempting any electrical checks. Safety is your top priority when dealing with appliance repairs. If you are not comfortable working with electrical components, it is best to seek professional help immediately.

### The Check Valve's Role

Most dishwashers have a check valve in the drain line, typically located near the drain pump or at the hose connection point. Its purpose is to stop dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher tub after it has been pumped out. If this check valve gets stuck in the closed position, it will block water from draining. If it gets stuck open, dirty water from the sink drain can flow back into the dishwasher.

To inspect the check valve, you would typically need to access the drain pump area or the drain hose connection. The valve often looks like a small flapper or rubber duckbill. Check for any debris caught in it or if it moves freely. If it appears damaged or stuck, it may need replacement. This part is usually inexpensive, but accessing it can be challenging, often requiring removal of the dishwasher's outer panels.

### Control Board or Wiring Issues

If the drain pump is not running at all, and you have confirmed it is not physically jammed, the problem might be electrical. This could involve the dishwasher's main control board or faulty wiring. The control board sends signals to all components, including the drain pump. If it malfunctions, it might not activate the drain cycle. Similarly, a loose, corroded, or broken wire connecting the control board to the drain pump can prevent power from reaching it.

Diagnosing these electrical issues requires a multimeter to test for continuity and voltage. This is a task for experienced DIYers or, more commonly, a professional. Control board replacements are expensive and should only be done after ruling out all other causes. Wiring problems can be tricky to trace without a wiring diagram specific to your Samsung model.

### Resetting Your Dishwasher

Sometimes, a temporary glitch in the dishwasher's electronics can cause drainage problems. Performing a simple reset can clear these errors. To reset your Samsung dishwasher, first unplug it from the wall outlet or turn off its power at the circuit breaker for about 5-10 minutes. This hard reset can clear the control board's memory and potentially resolve minor electronic issues.

After the waiting period, restore power to the dishwasher. Then, try running a short drain cycle or a quick wash cycle to see if the issue is resolved. This method works for many minor electronic hiccups. It is a good first step before diving into more complex electrical troubleshooting or component replacement.

## When to Call a Professional Appliance Technician

While many Samsung dishwasher not draining problems are fixable at home, some situations clearly call for professional help. Knowing when to stop your DIY efforts can save you time, prevent further damage to your appliance, and ensure your safety. I believe it is important to recognize your limits, especially when dealing with complex electrical components or unfamiliar plumbing.

You should consider calling a certified appliance technician if you have tried all the common troubleshooting steps, and your Samsung dishwasher still refuses to drain. This includes cleaning filters, checking hoses, addressing air gap/disposal issues, and inspecting for pump obstructions. If the problem persists after these efforts, the issue might be deeper than simple clogs.

Professional technicians have specialized tools and knowledge. They can quickly diagnose complex issues like a failing drain pump motor, a malfunctioning control board, or intricate wiring problems. They also ensure the repair is done correctly and safely, often providing a warranty on their work.

Consider professional help if:

*   **You suspect a drain pump failure:** While you can check for blockages, replacing a faulty drain pump motor is often complex. It involves electrical connections and proper reassembly. Improper installation can lead to leaks or further electrical issues.
*   **The issue is electrical:** If you hear no sounds from the pump, and resetting the dishwasher does not help, the problem might be with the control board or internal wiring. These repairs require electrical expertise and specific testing equipment.
*   **You cannot identify the source:** After following all troubleshooting steps, if you are still unsure why your Samsung dishwasher is not draining, a professional can pinpoint the exact cause efficiently.
*   **You lack proper tools or confidence:** If you do not have the right tools (like a multimeter) or feel uncomfortable disassembling parts of your dishwasher, it is safer to hire an expert. Attempting repairs beyond your skill level can cause more damage.
