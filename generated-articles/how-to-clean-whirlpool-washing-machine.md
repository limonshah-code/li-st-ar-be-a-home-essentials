## Keep Your Whirlpool Washing Machine Clean: A Complete Guide

Is your Whirlpool washing machine starting to smell less than fresh? Do your clothes not feel as clean as they once did? Over time, dirt, detergent residue, hard water minerals, and mold can build up inside your washer. This buildup leads to unpleasant odors and can even affect how well your machine cleans. Regular cleaning of your Whirlpool washing machine is essential. It ensures your laundry comes out truly clean and helps your appliance last longer.

This guide will show you how to perform a deep clean and maintain your Whirlpool washer. We will cover methods for both top-load and front-load models. You will learn about cleaning the drum, dispenser, gasket, and filters. Follow these steps to keep your Whirlpool washing machine in top condition.

### Takeaway

Keeping your Whirlpool washing machine clean is simple. Here are the main points:
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Run a monthly cleaning cycle with a dedicated cleaner, vinegar, or bleach.
*   **Component Focus:** Pay attention to the detergent dispenser, rubber gasket (front-loaders), and drain pump filter.
*   **Prevention:** Leave the door ajar after use and remove clothes promptly to prevent mold and mildew.
*   **Proper Detergent Use:** Use the correct amount of HE detergent to avoid residue buildup.

### Quick Answer

To clean your Whirlpool washing machine, run an empty hot water cycle with a cleaning agent like a washing machine cleaner, white vinegar, or bleach. Regularly wipe down the drum, detergent dispenser, and door seal (for front-loaders). This removes residue, prevents odors, and keeps your machine working well.

## Why Your Whirlpool Washer Needs Regular Cleaning

Your Whirlpool washing machine works hard to clean your clothes. However, it can get dirty itself. Dirt and grime from laundry can stick inside the drum. Leftover detergent and fabric softener also create residue. These elements combine with moisture to form a breeding ground for mold and mildew.

An unclean washer smells bad. This bad smell can transfer to your clothes. It also makes your machine less efficient. Buildup can clog parts and reduce water flow. Regular cleaning stops these problems. It keeps your clothes fresh and helps your machine run smoothly for many years. Neglecting this simple task can lead to repairs or early replacement.

## Essential Cleaning Supplies for Your Whirlpool Washer

Before you start cleaning your Whirlpool washing machine, gather the right tools and products. Having everything ready makes the job easier. You likely have most of these items in your home already. Using the right supplies helps you clean effectively without damaging your appliance. Always check your Whirlpool owner's manual for specific product recommendations or warnings.

Here is a list of what you will need:
*   **White Vinegar:** This is a natural cleaner and deodorizer. It helps break down hard water deposits and mildew.
*   **Baking Soda:** Baking soda is an abrasive cleaner. It helps remove tough stains and absorbs odors.
*   **Washing Machine Cleaner:** Products like Affresh or Tide Washing Machine Cleaner are designed for this job. They remove odor-causing residue.
*   **Bleach (Optional):** Some cleaning methods suggest bleach, especially for severe mold. Make sure it is safe for your machine and do not mix it with vinegar. For more details on using bleach, read about [Using Bleach to Clean Your Whirlpool Washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-whirlpool-washing-machine-with-bleach).
*   **Microfiber Cloths or Sponges:** These are good for wiping surfaces.
*   **Small Brush (like a toothbrush):** Useful for scrubbing tight spots, like the detergent dispenser.
*   **Warm Water:** For wiping and rinsing.
*   **Gloves:** Protect your hands from cleaning agents.

## How to Clean a Whirlpool Top-Load Washing Machine

Cleaning a top-load Whirlpool washer is straightforward. These machines are generally easier to clean than front-loaders. They do not have a rubber gasket that collects mold. Still, grime and odors can build up inside the drum and agitator. Follow these steps for a fresh, clean top-loader.

### Step 1: Prepare the Washer

First, make sure your washing machine is empty. Remove any clothes or items from the drum. Close the lid once it is empty. This prepares the machine for the cleaning cycle.

### Step 2: Vinegar Cycle

Pour two cups of white vinegar directly into the detergent dispenser or directly into the drum. Set your washer to the hottest water setting. Choose the largest load size and the longest wash cycle. Start the cycle. The hot water and vinegar will work together. They will break down mineral deposits, soap scum, and mold.

Let the cycle run completely. The vinegar helps to sanitize the drum. It also loosens any built-up residue. This step is important for odor removal.

### Step 3: Baking Soda Cycle

Once the vinegar cycle finishes, leave the washer empty. Add half a cup of baking soda directly into the drum. Run another cycle using the hottest water setting. Use the largest load size and a regular wash cycle. The baking soda acts as a gentle abrasive. It scrubs away any remaining residue. It also helps to absorb lingering odors.

Combining vinegar and baking soda provides a powerful cleaning action. They target different types of grime. This two-step process ensures a thorough clean.

### Step 4: Wipe Down the Drum and Lid

After the baking soda cycle finishes, open the washer lid. Use a clean microfiber cloth. Dip it in warm water with a little vinegar. Wipe down the entire interior of the drum. Pay attention to the agitator (if your model has one). Wipe the top of the drum and around the lid opening. Clean the underside of the lid as well. This removes any loosened dirt or mildew.

### Step 5: Clean the Dispensers

Top-load washers have detergent and fabric softener dispensers. These can get gummy with residue. Pull out removable dispenser parts if possible. Wash them in your sink with warm, soapy water. Use a small brush to scrub away buildup. Rinse them well and put them back. If parts are not removable, use a damp cloth and a brush to clean them inside.

## How to Clean a Whirlpool Front-Load Washing Machine

Front-load Whirlpool washing machines are popular for efficiency. However, they need special attention. Their design can trap moisture. This leads to mold and mildew growth, especially in the door gasket. Regular cleaning is critical for these models. It prevents bad odors and keeps your machine running well.

### Step 1: Focus on the Door Gasket

The rubber seal around the door, called the gasket, is a common place for mold. Open the washer door wide. Peel back the folds of the gasket. You will likely see dark spots or slime. Mix a solution of equal parts warm water and white vinegar. Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution. Carefully wipe away all visible mold and mildew from the gasket. Use a small brush if needed for tough spots.

For very stubborn mold, you can make a paste. Mix baking soda with a little water. Apply the paste to the moldy areas. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Then, scrub and wipe it clean. Rinse the gasket thoroughly with clean water. Leaving the door ajar after each wash helps prevent future mold.

### Step 2: Run a Cleaning Cycle

You can use a dedicated washing machine cleaner (like Affresh), white vinegar, or bleach for the cleaning cycle.

*   **Using a Washing Machine Cleaner:** Place one tablet of cleaner in the main detergent dispenser. Do not add clothes. Select the "Clean Washer" cycle if your Whirlpool model has one. If not, choose the "Tub Clean" or "Hot Water" cycle with an extra rinse option. Start the cycle.
*   **Using White Vinegar:** Pour two cups of white vinegar into the detergent dispenser. Select the hottest water setting and the largest load size. If your machine has a "Clean Washer" cycle, use that. If not, pick a "Heavy Duty" or "Sanitize" cycle. Start the cycle.
*   **Using Bleach:** Add half a cup of liquid chlorine bleach to the bleach dispenser. Never mix bleach with vinegar. Select the "Clean Washer" cycle or the hottest water setting. Ensure no laundry is in the machine. Start the cycle. Bleach is effective for sanitizing and killing mold.

Let the chosen cycle run completely. This cleans the internal parts of the drum and hoses. It helps remove soap scum and bacteria buildup.

### Step 3: Clean the Detergent Dispenser

Front-load dispensers can also get very dirty. Pull out the detergent dispenser drawer. Many Whirlpool models have removable parts. If removable, soak the drawer and its inserts in warm, soapy water. Use a small brush to scrub away caked-on detergent and fabric softener residue. Rinse thoroughly. Wipe down the inside of the dispenser housing with a damp cloth. Push the dispenser drawer back in place. For more detailed steps, see [Cleaning Your Whirlpool Detergent Dispenser](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-whirlpool-washing-machine-soap-dispenser).

### Step 4: Wipe Down the Drum Interior

After the cleaning cycle, use a clean, damp microfiber cloth. Wipe down the inside of the drum. This removes any loose particles or residue that might remain. Ensure the drum feels smooth and clean. Leave the door slightly open to allow the interior to air dry. This prevents moisture from creating new mold or mildew.

## Tackling Persistent Mildew and Odor in Your Washer

A musty smell is a common problem with washing machines, especially front-loaders. This odor comes from mold and mildew. It grows in damp, dark places. If your Whirlpool washer has a persistent smell, you need a deep cleaning approach. This helps to eliminate the source of the odor.

### Identify the Source

First, find where the mildew grows. In front-loaders, the door gasket is the main culprit. In top-loaders, check under the agitator or around the rim of the drum. Small water puddles can harbor mildew. Sometimes, the smell comes from soap scum buildup in the hoses or pump.

### Deep Clean the Gasket (Front-Loaders)

For heavy mildew on the gasket, a strong solution helps. Mix one part bleach with one part water. Put on gloves. Apply this solution to the mildewed areas with a cloth or spray bottle. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Scrub gently with a non-abrasive brush. Wipe thoroughly with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat if needed. Make sure to rinse the area well with plain water to remove all bleach residue. Do not let bleach sit too long, as it can damage the rubber over time.

### Vinegar and Hot Water Soaks

For the drum itself, a hot water and vinegar soak can work wonders. Fill your washer with the hottest water setting. Add two cups of white vinegar. Let the washer agitate for a minute or two. Then, pause the cycle. Let the water and vinegar mixture sit in the drum for 30 minutes to an hour. This soak allows the vinegar to penetrate and kill mildew spores. After soaking, resume the cycle. The hot water helps flush everything out.

### Baking Soda Booster

After the vinegar soak, run a second empty hot cycle with half a cup of baking soda. Baking soda helps neutralize any remaining odors. It also provides a gentle scrubbing action. This combination effectively eliminates smells. These steps ensure your washer smells fresh.

## Cleaning the Detergent Dispenser and Bleach Tray

The detergent dispenser and bleach tray are often overlooked. They can accumulate thick, gunky residue. This residue not only looks bad but can also clog the dispenser. Clogs prevent detergent from reaching your clothes properly. This makes your laundry less clean. Regular cleaning of these parts is a must.

### Removing the Dispenser Drawer

Most Whirlpool washing machines, especially front-loaders, have a removable dispenser drawer. Pull the drawer out completely. You may need to press a release tab. Look at your washer's manual if you are unsure how to remove it. Once out, you will see separate compartments for liquid detergent, powder detergent, fabric softener, and bleach.

### Soaking and Scrubbing

Take the removable parts of the dispenser drawer. Soak them in warm, soapy water in your sink. Use dish soap for this. Let them soak for 15-20 minutes. This softens the dried-on detergent and fabric softener. While they soak, use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away the gunk. Pay attention to all crevices and corners. The same goes for the bleach compartment. Rinse all parts thoroughly with clean water. Ensure no soap residue remains.

### Cleaning the Dispenser Housing

The area where the dispenser drawer sits also needs cleaning. Use a damp cloth to wipe inside this housing. You might find more residue inside. Use your small brush to reach tight spots. This ensures all parts of the dispenser system are clean.

### Reassembling

Once all parts are clean and dry, put the dispenser drawer back together. Slide it firmly back into its slot in the washing machine. A clean dispenser ensures your detergent and additives are delivered correctly. This helps your clothes get truly clean every time.

## Don't Forget the Filter and Drain Pump

Many people do not realize their washing machine has a filter. The drain pump filter, sometimes called a coin trap, catches small items. These include coins, lint, buttons, and small socks. If this filter gets clogged, it can cause problems. Your machine might not drain properly, or it could develop strange noises. Cleaning this filter is an important part of washing machine maintenance. It helps your Whirlpool machine run without issues.

### Locating the Filter

The drain pump filter location varies by model. On most front-load Whirlpool washers, it is behind a small access panel. This panel is usually at the bottom front of the machine. It might be behind a kick plate. For top-load models, the filter might be near the drain hose or integrated into the pump itself. Check your owner's manual for its exact location. The manual will show you how to access it safely. To learn more about opening this part, see [How to Open Your Whirlpool Washer Filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-open-whirlpool-washing-machine-filter).

### Preparing for Cleaning

Before opening the filter, prepare for water drainage. Some water will likely spill out. Place a shallow pan or towel under the filter cap. You might also want to have a dry towel ready for spills. It is also wise to turn off the power to the washer. Unplug it from the wall outlet. This prevents accidental starts.

### Draining and Removing the Filter

Slowly unscrew the filter cap. Water will start to drain into your pan. Let all the water drain out. Once drained, fully remove the filter. It will probably be covered in lint, hair, and small items. Remove all debris. You may find small objects like coins or hairpins. These items can damage the pump if left inside. If you notice a lot of water is still stuck, you might need to [Drain Water from Your Whirlpool Washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-water-in-whirlpool-washing-machine) before opening the filter.

### Cleaning and Reinstallation

Rinse the filter under warm running water. Use a small brush to clean off any stubborn grime. Clean the housing where the filter sits as well. Look inside the pump opening for any remaining blockages. Once the filter is clean, screw it back into place securely. Make sure it is tight to prevent leaks. Close the access panel. Plug your washer back in. Regularly cleaning this filter helps prevent drain issues and extends your machine's life.

## External Care and Finishing Touches for Your Washer

While the inside of your Whirlpool washing machine gets the most attention, the exterior needs care too. A clean outside contributes to the overall look of your laundry area. It also helps prevent dust and grime from entering the internal components. Giving your washer's exterior a quick clean is the final step in comprehensive maintenance.

### Wiping Down the Cabinet

Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe down the entire outer surface of your washing machine. This includes the top, sides, and front panel. For stubborn smudges, a mild all-purpose cleaner works well. Spray the cleaner onto your cloth, not directly onto the machine. This prevents excess moisture from getting into electrical components. Wipe away dust, drips, and fingerprints. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scrubbing pads. They can scratch the finish.

### Cleaning the Control Panel

The control panel often collects dust and detergent drips. Use a slightly damp microfiber cloth to gently wipe it clean. If your control panel has physical buttons, wipe around them carefully. Avoid spraying water directly onto the panel. Excess moisture can damage the electronics. For touch-sensitive panels, a dry or very lightly dampened cloth is best. Always ensure the panel is dry before operating the machine.

### Inspecting Hoses and Cords

While cleaning the exterior, take a moment to inspect the water supply hoses and the power cord. Look for any signs of wear, cracks, or leaks. Damaged hoses can cause major water damage. If you see any issues, consider replacing the hoses. Make sure the power cord is not pinched or damaged. These quick checks can prevent future problems. Performing [DIY Washing Machine Maintenance Tips](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) often includes these simple safety checks.

### Keeping the Area Clean

Finally, ensure the area around your washing machine is clean. Dust and lint can accumulate behind and under the machine. These can be a fire hazard. Regularly vacuum or sweep the floor around your washer. This completes your cleaning routine. A clean washer inside and out not only looks better but also performs better.

## Regular Maintenance Schedule for Your Whirlpool

Cleaning your Whirlpool washing machine is not a one-time event. Establishing a regular maintenance schedule keeps your appliance fresh and extends its lifespan. Consistency is key to preventing odors and costly repairs. By following a simple routine, you can ensure your machine is always ready for your laundry needs.

### Monthly Cleaning Routine

Aim to run a cleaning cycle once a month. This can be with a washing machine cleaner, white vinegar, or bleach. This monthly deep clean flushes out accumulated residue and odors from the drum and internal components. Make it a routine, like the first Sunday of every month. This makes it easier to remember. Consistent monthly cleaning prevents major buildup.

### Weekly Wipes for Key Areas

*   **Door Gasket (Front-Loaders):** After your last load of the week, wipe down the rubber gasket thoroughly. This removes moisture and any visible mildew before it spreads.
*   **Detergent Dispenser:** Give the detergent dispenser a quick wipe. Clean out any sticky residue.
*   **Drum Interior:** Briefly wipe down the inside of the drum with a damp cloth. This helps remove any lint or debris left behind from clothes.

These quick weekly wipes take only a few minutes. They stop issues from building up.

### Quarterly Filter Check

Plan to check and clean the drain pump filter every three months. This helps prevent clogs and drainage issues. If you wash a lot of pet hair or very dirty items, you might need to check it more often. This proactive step saves you from unexpected machine problems.

### Daily Habits for Longevity

*   **Remove Laundry Promptly:** Do not leave wet laundry in the washer. This is a major cause of mildew and odors. Transfer clothes to the dryer as soon as the cycle ends.
*   **Leave the Door Ajar:** After each wash cycle, leave the washer door slightly open. This allows the interior to air dry. It prevents moisture buildup that leads to mold and mildew. This is especially important for front-load washers.
*   **Use HE Detergent:** Always use High-Efficiency (HE) detergent if your Whirlpool washer is an HE model. HE detergents produce less suds. Too many suds can leave residue and create problems. Use the correct amount of detergent. More is not always better.
*   **Wipe Down Exterior After Use:** A quick wipe of the exterior after laundry day helps keep it clean. It prevents buildup of dust and spills.

By adopting these simple habits and following a consistent cleaning schedule, your Whirlpool washing machine will stay clean and efficient. This ensures your clothes are always fresh and your appliance serves you well for many years.
