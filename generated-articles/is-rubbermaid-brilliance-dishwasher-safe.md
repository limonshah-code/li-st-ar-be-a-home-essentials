### Understanding Rubbermaid Brilliance Dishwasher Safety Labels

Many household items come with care instructions. Rubbermaid Brilliance containers are no different. They feature labels that guide users on safe cleaning practices. Finding the "dishwasher safe" symbol helps you understand how to clean them. This symbol looks like a dishwasher with water droplets.

Rubbermaid Brilliance containers are made from a durable, clear plastic. This plastic is designed to resist stains and odors. It also holds up well to typical washing cycles. Always look for the symbol or text on the container's bottom. This ensures you follow the manufacturer's specific advice. Knowing these labels helps keep your containers in good shape.

#### Interpreting Dishwasher Symbols for Plastic

Dishwasher symbols communicate important information quickly. A symbol showing a dishwasher and a plate means the item is generally safe. If there's a line across the top, it indicates "top rack only." This distinction is crucial for plastic items. The bottom rack of a dishwasher has hotter water and is closer to the heating element.

Plastics, even strong ones, can become soft or distorted under high heat. This is why the top rack is always preferred for Rubbermaid Brilliance. The lower temperatures and less direct heat protect the plastic's structure. Understanding these symbols makes caring for your items simpler. It also prevents accidental damage. Always take a moment to check these visual cues before loading your dishwasher.

### Why Top Rack is Best for Plastic Containers

Placing plastic items correctly in the dishwasher matters a lot. The top rack is always the recommended spot for Rubbermaid Brilliance containers. This placement protects your containers from damage. Understanding the dishwasher's heating system explains why.

Dishwashers have heating elements. These elements are usually at the bottom. They heat the water during the wash cycle. They also dry dishes at the end. Temperatures on the bottom rack can reach very high levels. These temperatures can cause plastic to melt, warp, or crack. Your beautiful clear containers could become distorted or unusable
