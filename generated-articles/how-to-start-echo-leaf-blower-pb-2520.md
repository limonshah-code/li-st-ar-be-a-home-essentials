### Preparing Your Echo PB 2520: Essential Pre-Start Checks

Before you attempt to start your Echo PB 2520 leaf blower, some crucial checks prevent problems. Taking a few moments for these steps ensures safety and smooth operation. I always perform these checks myself before any yard work. This small effort saves a lot of time and frustration later.

First, check the fuel tank. Make sure it contains fresh, properly mixed fuel. The Echo PB 2520 requires a 50:1 mixture of gasoline and 2-stroke engine oil. Using old fuel or an incorrect mix can cause significant damage to the engine. We will discuss fuel in more detail later. Next, inspect the air filter. A dirty air filter restricts airflow, making the engine hard to start or run poorly. Clean or replace it as needed. Also, visually inspect the spark plug and its wire. Ensure the spark plug wire is securely attached.

Safety is paramount when operating any power tool. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). This includes safety glasses to protect your eyes from debris, hearing protection to guard against noise, and sturdy gloves. Never operate the leaf blower near flammable materials or in an enclosed space due to exhaust fumes. Make sure your work area is clear of obstacles and other people or pets. These simple preparations are the foundation for a successful and safe experience with your Echo PB 2520.

### The Cold Start Procedure for Your Echo PB 2520 Leaf Blower

Starting a cold engine requires a specific sequence of steps to enrich the fuel mixture. When your Echo PB 2520 has been sitting for a while, like overnight or for several days, it is considered "cold." I follow these steps precisely to get my blower running quickly. This method ensures the engine gets the right amount of fuel to ignite.

First, ensure the ignition switch is in the "On" position. You cannot start the engine if the switch is off. Locate the primer bulb, usually a small rubber bulb on the carburetor. Press the primer bulb 8 to 10 times until you see fuel visibly flowing through it and the bulb is full. This action draws fuel from the tank into the carburetor, preparing the engine for ignition. Next, find the choke lever. Push the choke lever to the "Full Choke" or "Start" position. This position restricts airflow, making the fuel mixture richer for easier cold starting.

Now, place the leaf blower on a flat, stable surface. Use one hand to firmly hold the blower down, preventing it from moving. With your other hand, grasp the starter rope handle. Pull the starter rope firmly and smoothly several times until you hear the engine "burp" or make a brief attempt to start. It may just make a sputtering sound. Once you hear this sound, immediately move the choke lever to the "Half Choke" or "Run" position. Continue pulling the starter rope firmly until the engine fully starts and runs. Allow the engine to warm up for about 30 seconds to a minute before moving the choke to the "Off" or "Run" position and beginning operation. If your leaf blower struggles to start even after following these steps, you might need to troubleshoot common issues.

### Warm Starting Your Echo PB 2520 Leaf Blower

Starting an Echo PB 2520 that has recently been running is much simpler than a cold start. The engine is already warm, meaning the fuel system does not need as much enrichment. I find these starts are usually quick and effortless. This procedure is perfect if you just took a short break or refueled the blower.

First, make sure the ignition switch is in the "On" position. Unlike a cold start, you usually do not need to prime the engine for a warm start. The carburetor should still have enough fuel from its previous run. Next, locate the choke lever. For a warm engine, set the choke lever to the "Half Choke" position, or sometimes even the "Off" or "Run" position if the engine is still very hot. Starting with half choke is a good general practice for warm starts.

Place the leaf blower on a stable surface. Hold it down firmly with one hand. With your other hand, pull the starter rope firmly and smoothly. Often, the engine will start on the first or second pull. Once it starts, let it run for a few seconds. If you started with half choke, move the choke lever to the "Off" or "Run" position immediately. The engine should then run smoothly at idle. If your blower starts but then immediately shuts off, you might want to check out our article on [why does my leaf blower keep shutting off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-leaf-blower-keep-shutting-off). This simple process ensures your blower is ready to go back to work with minimal delay.

### Essential Fuel and Oil Considerations for Optimal Performance

Proper fuel and oil are critical for your Echo PB 2520's health and starting ability. Using the wrong type or old fuel is one of the most common reasons small engines fail to start or run poorly. I cannot stress enough the importance of getting this right. The Echo PB 2520 uses a 2-stroke engine, which requires a specific fuel-oil mixture.

Your Echo PB 2520 needs a 50:1 fuel mix. This means 50 parts unleaded gasoline to 1 part high-quality 2-stroke engine oil. Always use fresh, unleaded gasoline with an octane rating of 89 or higher. Avoid gasoline with high ethanol content (E10 or higher), as ethanol can damage fuel lines and carburetor components over time. Many manufacturers recommend using ethanol-free fuel whenever possible. For the oil, use a premium 2-stroke engine oil specifically designed for air-cooled engines. Echo brand 2-stroke oil is an excellent choice, ensuring compatibility and performance.

Mixing the fuel correctly is straightforward. Use a dedicated fuel mixing container with proper markings. Pour the required amount of 2-stroke oil first, then add the gasoline. Close the container and shake it gently to ensure the oil and gas are thoroughly mixed. Never mix oil and gas directly in the leaf blower's fuel tank. Always use fresh fuel, meaning gasoline purchased within the last 30 days. Stale fuel can cause starting difficulties and engine damage. If you store fuel, add a fuel stabilizer to extend its shelf life. Old fuel often leads to issues where the engine only runs with the choke on. If your blower is exhibiting this behavior, refer to our guide on [why does my leaf blower only run with the choke on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-leaf-blower-only-run-with-the-choke-on). Proper fuel management keeps your Echo PB 2520 running strong for years.

### Troubleshooting Common Starting Issues with Your PB 2520

Even with the correct starting procedure, sometimes your Echo PB 2520 might refuse to start. Do not despair; many starting issues have simple solutions. I have encountered these problems many times, and most are easily fixable at home. Knowing what to check can save you a trip to the repair shop.

First, recheck the basics: Is the ignition switch in the "On" position? Is there enough fresh fuel in the tank with the correct 50:1 mix? If the fuel is old, drain it and replace it with fresh mix. Old fuel is a primary culprit for non-starting engines. Next, inspect the spark plug. A fouled or damaged spark plug will prevent ignition. Remove the spark plug using a spark plug wrench. Check for dirt, carbon buildup, or damage to the electrode. Clean it with a wire brush or replace it if necessary. Ensure the gap is correct according to your owner's manual (typically 0.025 inches). While you have the spark plug out, you can check for spark. Reattach the spark plug wire to the plug, hold the base of the plug against a metal part of the engine (not painted), and pull the starter cord. You should see a strong blue spark. If no spark, the spark plug, spark plug wire, or ignition module might be faulty.

Another common issue is a clogged air filter. A dirty filter restricts airflow, making it hard for the engine to breathe and start. Remove the air filter cover and inspect the filter. Clean foam filters with warm, soapy water, rinse, dry thoroughly, and apply a few drops of clean engine oil before reinstallation. Replace paper filters if they are excessively dirty. Fuel delivery problems are also common. Check the fuel filter inside the tank (at the end of the fuel line). If it is clogged, replace it. Also, check for kinks or damage in the fuel lines themselves. If your leaf blower starts but immediately shuts off when you give it gas, this often points to fuel delivery or carburetor issues. Our article on [why does my leaf blower turn off when I give it gas](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-leaf-blower-turn-off-when-i-give-it-gas) provides further guidance. Sometimes, the carburetor might be clogged with old fuel residue, requiring cleaning or adjustment. If the engine consistently refuses to start after these checks, consider professional service.

### Routine Maintenance Tips to Ensure Easy Starting

Regular maintenance keeps your Echo PB 2520 running smoothly and ensures easy starting every time. Neglecting maintenance often leads to frustrating starting problems. I make it a point to perform these simple tasks regularly, and my blower always performs well. These tips extend the life of your equipment.

**Air Filter Cleaning:** The air filter protects your engine from dust and debris. Clean or replace the air filter regularly, especially after dusty jobs. A clean air filter ensures proper air-fuel mixture, making starting easier. A clogged filter starves the engine of air.

**Spark Plug Inspection and Replacement:** Inspect the spark plug annually or after every 25 hours of use. Look for signs of wear, carbon buildup, or damage. Clean it with a wire brush or replace it with a new one. A fresh spark plug provides a strong spark for reliable ignition. Make sure the spark plug gap is correct; consult your owner's manual for the specific gap setting.

**Fuel System Check:**
*   **Fuel Filter:** The fuel filter, located inside the fuel tank on the end of the fuel line, prevents debris from reaching the carburetor. Check it annually and replace it if it looks discolored or clogged.
*   **Fuel Lines:** Inspect fuel lines for cracks, hardening, or leaks. Replace any damaged lines to prevent fuel delivery issues.
*   **Fuel Cap:** Ensure the fuel cap vent is clear. A clogged vent can create a vacuum in the tank, preventing fuel flow.

**Carburetor Adjustment (If Necessary):** The carburetor mixes air and fuel. Over time, or with changes in altitude, it might need adjustment. This is often best left to a professional, but for minor issues, referring to your manual for idle speed adjustments might help if the engine struggles to idle after starting.

**General Cleaning:** Keep the exterior of your leaf blower clean, especially around the engine and cooling fins. Dirt and debris can cause the engine to overheat. A clean machine runs more efficiently and is easier to maintain. Implementing these routine maintenance practices will significantly reduce your chances of encountering starting issues and prolong the life of your Echo PB 2520.

### Storage and Seasonal Preparedness for Your Leaf Blower

Proper storage is crucial for preventing starting problems after extended periods of inactivity. If you put your Echo PB 2520 away for the winter without preparation, you are almost guaranteed starting headaches next spring. I learned this the hard way years ago, and now I always prepare my equipment for storage. This ensures a quick start-up for the next season.

First, run the fuel tank empty. Allow the engine to run until it completely runs out of fuel. This prevents old fuel from sitting in the carburetor and fuel lines, which can lead to gumming and clogging. If you prefer not to run it dry, add a high-quality fuel stabilizer to the fuel in the tank. Then, run the engine for a few minutes to ensure the stabilizer circulates throughout the fuel system. This is a good option if you plan to use the blower occasionally or for shorter storage periods. However, completely draining the fuel is always the safest option for long-term storage (more than 3-4 months).

After draining the fuel or adding stabilizer, perform some basic cleaning and maintenance. Clean the exterior of the blower, removing any dirt, grass, or debris. Check and clean or replace the air filter. Remove the spark plug and pour about a teaspoon of fresh 2-stroke oil into the cylinder. Gently pull the starter rope a few times to distribute the oil, then reinstall the spark plug. This "fogging" prevents rust and corrosion inside the cylinder during storage. Store your Echo PB 2520 in a clean, dry area, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. A shed or garage is ideal. Proper storage prevents future headaches and ensures your leaf blower is ready to work when you need it most.

### Why Your Echo PB 2520 Might Not Run at Full Speed

After successfully starting your Echo PB 2520, you expect it to run at its peak performance. Sometimes, however, you might notice it is not delivering its usual power or speed. This issue can be frustrating when you need to clear a large area quickly. I have personally experienced this, and it often points to a few common culprits. Understanding these can help you get your blower back to full strength.

One of the most frequent reasons for reduced speed is a clogged air filter. Just like with starting, a dirty air filter restricts airflow to the engine. This "suffocates" the engine, preventing it from reaching its maximum RPMs. Regularly cleaning or replacing the air filter is a simple yet effective solution. Another significant factor is old or improper fuel. Stale gasoline loses its volatility and can lead to a lean fuel mixture, causing the engine to run weak or "sputter." Ensure you are always using fresh, correctly mixed 50:1 fuel. Issues with the carburetor, such as clogged jets, can also restrict fuel flow, directly impacting engine speed. This often happens if fuel was left in the blower during storage without stabilizer.

A restricted muffler or spark arrestor screen can also reduce engine performance. Over time, carbon buildup can block the exhaust path, creating back pressure and reducing power. Regularly cleaning the spark arrestor screen is important. Lastly, a worn or improperly gapped spark plug can lead to an inefficient spark, causing the engine to misfire and not run at full speed. Inspecting and replacing the spark plug is part of routine maintenance that can prevent this. Addressing these points usually resolves issues with your Echo PB 2520 not running at full speed, restoring its powerful performance.
