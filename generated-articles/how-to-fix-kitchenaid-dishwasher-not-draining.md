If your KitchenAid dishwasher is not draining, you most likely have a clog in the filter, sump, or drain hose. You can also have an issue with the air gap, drain pump, or drain valve. Locate the blockage or faulty part to restore drainage.

### Safety First: Essential Steps Before Fixing Your KitchenAid Dishwasher

Working with any appliance requires careful attention to safety. Before you even think about troubleshooting your KitchenAid dishwasher not draining, you must prepare. Electrical shock and water damage are real risks. Take these steps seriously to protect yourself and your home. My priority when starting any repair is always safety.

First, turn off the power to your dishwasher. Go to your home's main electrical panel. Find the circuit breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position. This stops electricity from reaching the appliance. Next, turn off the water supply valve to the dishwasher. This valve is usually under the sink or behind the dishwasher itself. You will prevent water leaks while working.

You will also need to remove any standing water from the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Use a cup or a wet/dry vacuum for this task. Mop up the remaining moisture with towels. This makes the workspace dry and accessible. It also helps prevent water from spilling onto your floor as you work. Always wear rubber gloves during this process. This protects your hands from dirty water and potential sharp objects inside the dishwasher. Following these safety measures makes the repair process much smoother and safer for you.

### Clear the KitchenAid Dishwasher Filter and Sump for Better Draining

A clogged filter is the most common reason a KitchenAid dishwasher does not drain. This part collects food particles and debris during the wash cycle. If it gets too full, water cannot pass through and drain away. Clearing it is usually a simple and quick fix. I always start my diagnosis here.

Your KitchenAid dishwasher has a filter assembly located at the bottom of the tub. It often consists of two parts: an upper filter screen and a lower filter cup. To access them, first remove the lower dish rack. Then, twist or lift the filter assembly components as per your model's instructions. Some models have a simple twist-lock mechanism. Carefully pull them out of the dishwasher.

Inspect both parts for trapped food debris, grease, and other foreign objects. You might find pieces of broken glass, fruit seeds, or even small bones. Rinse the filters under warm running water. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away stubborn residue. You can also use a small amount of dish soap to cut through grease. Once clean, rinse them thoroughly until all debris is gone. Replace the filter components back into the dishwasher. Make sure they are seated correctly and locked in place. This ensures proper filtration during future cycles. A clean filter can significantly improve your dishwasher's draining performance. For a deeper clean, consider learning how to [clean a KitchenAid dishwasher with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-kitchenaid-dishwasher-with-vinegar). This helps break down stubborn grease and mineral deposits throughout the system.

### Untangle Kinks and Clear Blockages in Your Dishwasher Drain Hose

The drain hose is another frequent culprit when a KitchenAid dishwasher fails to drain. This hose carries the dirty water from the dishwasher tub to your kitchen sink drain or garbage disposal. It can get kinked, crushed, or clogged over time. Checking it is an important step in troubleshooting.

First, pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet recess if possible. This gives you better access to the back of the unit. Inspect the entire length of the drain hose. Look for any visible kinks or bends that might restrict water flow. Sometimes, simply repositioning the dishwasher can solve this problem. If the hose is severely kinked or damaged, you may need to replace it. A crushed hose will never allow proper drainage.

Next, check for internal blockages within the hose. Disconnect both ends of the drain hose. One end connects to the dishwasher's drain pump. The other end connects to the sink drain or garbage disposal. Have a bucket ready to catch any residual water. Look inside the hose for food debris, grease buildup, or even small toys that might have fallen into the dishwasher. You can use a straightened coat hanger or a long brush to clear out any clogs. Flush the hose with water to ensure it's completely clear. Reconnect the hose securely once cleared. Ensure there are no new kinks during reinstallation. Proper hose connection prevents future drainage issues. This step is similar across many brands, including if you ever need to fix a [Whirlpool dishwasher not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-whirlpool-dishwasher-not-draining), as KitchenAid and Whirlpool are related.

### Address Air Gap and High Loop Issues Affecting Drainage

Some KitchenAid dishwashers, depending on installation, use an air gap or a high loop to prevent dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If either of these components malfunctions or is improperly set up, your dishwasher might not drain. It is vital to understand how these systems work.

An air gap is a small cylindrical fixture found on top of your kitchen counter, usually next to the faucet. It has two hoses connected to it: one from the dishwasher drain and one going to the garbage disposal or sink drain. Its purpose is to create an air break, preventing dirty drain water from siphoning back into the clean dishwasher. If your air gap gets clogged, water cannot flow through it, causing a backup in the dishwasher. Unscrew the cap of the air gap and remove its inner cover. Clear out any food particles, grease, or debris that might be blocking the passages. Use a small brush or a toothpick to dislodge stubborn clogs. Reassemble the air gap securely after cleaning.

If you do not have an air gap, your dishwasher likely uses a high loop in its drain hose. This means the drain hose rises high under the sink, typically secured to the underside of the countertop, before dropping down to the garbage disposal or drain connection. This high point serves the same purpose as an air gap: to prevent backflow. Ensure the high loop is properly installed and secured. If the hose sags, it can create a trap where water sits, leading to drainage issues. You might need to secure the hose with a zip tie or clamp to maintain the high loop. Correct installation of either system is crucial for effective drainage. My own KitchenAid dishwasher uses a high loop, and I check its position regularly. Sometimes, simply ensuring proper hose routing, as you might do for [GE dishwasher not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-ge-dishwasher-not-draining), can resolve the issue.

### Inspect and Clear the KitchenAid Dishwasher Drain Pump

If the filter and hose are clear, the next likely culprit for a KitchenAid dishwasher not draining is the drain pump. The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the dishwasher and into your home's drainage system. A faulty or obstructed pump will prevent water removal. Checking it requires a bit more effort.

First, ensure the power is still off and all standing water is removed from the tub. The drain pump is typically located under the dishwasher, often accessible from the front or bottom. You might need to remove the lower access panel (kickplate) to reach it. On some models, you might need to tilt the dishwasher or pull it out completely. Carefully inspect the pump for any visible obstructions. Small pieces of glass, plastic, or food debris can get lodged in the pump's impeller. The impeller is a small fan-like component that spins to push water. If it cannot spin freely, the pump cannot drain.

Use a pair of needle-nose pliers or tweezers to carefully remove any debris you find. Turn the impeller by hand to ensure it spins freely. If it does not, there might be a deeper obstruction or the pump motor itself could be faulty. If the pump is making unusual noises but not draining, it might be running but struggling with an internal obstruction or a worn motor. If the impeller spins freely but the pump still does not work, you may need to test its electrical continuity with a multimeter or consider a replacement. Replacing a drain pump can be a DIY task for many, similar to what you might do if your [Maytag dishwasher is not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-maytag-dishwasher-not-draining), as these brands share many similarities. When putting your KitchenAid dishwasher back together after such repairs, refer to resources on [how to put a KitchenAid dishwasher back together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-kitchenaid-dishwasher-back-together) to ensure proper reassembly.

### Troubleshoot the Dishwasher Drain Valve and Solenoid

Beyond the pump, some KitchenAid dishwashers use a drain valve or solenoid to control water flow during the drain cycle. This component opens to allow water out and closes to keep water in during the wash. If this valve is stuck closed or the solenoid powering it fails, water cannot exit the tub. This problem is less common than clogs but still a possibility.

The drain valve is often part of the drain pump assembly or located near it. It is an electro-mechanical part. A solenoid is an electromagnet that moves a plunger when energized, which in turn opens or closes the valve. With the power off and water removed, locate this valve. Inspect it for any obvious physical damage or blockages. Sometimes, a small piece of debris can prevent the valve from fully opening.

You can often test the solenoid's function with a multimeter. Check for continuity across its terminals. If there is no continuity, the solenoid is likely faulty and needs replacement. If it has continuity but still does not work, the issue might be with the power supply to the solenoid or the main control board. If the valve mechanism itself is physically jammed, you may try to gently free it. However, exercise caution not to damage delicate components. If the drain valve or solenoid is visibly damaged or fails electrical tests, replacing it is the next step. This is a more advanced repair, but still manageable for a determined DIYer.

### Examine Electrical Components: Motor, Timer, and Control Board

When simpler solutions fail, the problem with your KitchenAid dishwasher not draining might stem from an electrical component. The main wash motor, the timer, or the electronic control board can all affect the drain cycle. These parts tell the drain pump when to activate. A fault in any of them can stop the draining process. This is where things get more complex, and often a professional diagnosis is best.

The main wash motor, also known as the circulation pump motor, drives the wash action and sometimes integrates with the drain pump. If this motor fails entirely, it can impact the draining function. You might hear no sounds at all when the dishwasher tries to drain, or only a humming noise without any water movement. Testing the motor often involves checking its electrical connections and windings with a multimeter. This requires specific knowledge of wiring diagrams and electrical safety.

The timer or control board acts as the brain of your dishwasher. It sends electrical signals to all components, including the drain pump and valve, at the correct times during the cycle. If the control board is faulty, it might not send the "drain" signal. Signs of a failing control board include erratic behavior, unresponsive buttons, or error codes related to draining. Replacing a control board or timer is often expensive and requires careful installation to avoid further damage. Before replacing, ensure all other components are working correctly. I generally recommend consulting a professional technician for these complex electrical issues. They have the specialized tools and expertise to diagnose and fix such problems safely. Sometimes, a power issue can cause various problems, including if your [KitchenAid dishwasher has no power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-have-no-power) at all.
