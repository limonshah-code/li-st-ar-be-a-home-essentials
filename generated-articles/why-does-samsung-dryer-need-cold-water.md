Samsung dryers require cold water primarily to generate steam for specialized cycles like Steam Sanitize, Wrinkle Away, or Refresh. The dryer takes cold water, heats it, and converts it into steam, which then permeates your clothes to smooth out wrinkles, remove odors, and kill germs without high heat. This feature enhances fabric care and saves time.

## Understanding the Samsung Dryer Cold Water Connection

It might seem unusual for a dryer to use water. Traditional dryers only use heat and airflow. Modern Samsung dryers are different. Many models include steam functions. These functions require a water source. The water source for these features is always a cold water line.

The dryer does not use hot water for these purposes. Hot water can create mineral buildup faster. Cold water is generally purer and reduces this risk. The dryer itself heats the water to create steam. This internal heating ensures optimal steam conditions.

### What is the Cold Water Inlet For?

The cold water inlet on your Samsung dryer is crucial. It supplies water specifically for steam cycles. This connection is separate from your washing machine. It links directly to your home's cold water supply.

Without this connection, steam cycles will not work. Your dryer may display an error code. It might simply skip the steam part of a chosen cycle. Ensure a proper connection for full functionality.

### How Steam Dryers Work

Steam dryers have a small internal heater. This heater heats the cold water. It turns the water into steam. The steam is then injected into the dryer drum. This process happens during specific cycles.

The steam mixes with warm air. It permeates fabric fibers. This action helps to relax wrinkles. It also helps to remove odors. Some cycles use steam for sanitization. Steam can kill common bacteria. This is a great feature for bedding or baby clothes.

## The Role of Cold Water in Steam Cycles

Cold water is the cornerstone of your Samsung dryer's steam capabilities. It is the raw material. The dryer transforms this raw material into powerful steam. This steam then works its magic on your clothes. Knowing its role helps appreciate the technology.

The dryer pulls cold water from your home's supply. It sends this water to a small steam generator inside. This generator has a heating element. The element rapidly heats the water. This process creates the steam needed for various cycles.

### Steam Sanitize Cycle Explained

The Steam Sanitize cycle is very useful. It uses high heat and steam. This combination kills 99.9% of common bacteria. I use this for towels and children's clothes. It gives me peace of mind.

The cold water feeds the steam generator. The generator produces a burst of steam. This steam penetrates fabrics deeply. It helps to sanitize items. This cycle is an excellent option for non-washable items. It is also good for items needing extra cleanliness.

### Wrinkle Away and Refresh Functions

Many Samsung dryers have a Wrinkle Away cycle. They also offer a Refresh cycle. These cycles rely on steam. They help you save time. You can avoid ironing some items.

Cold water is essential for these functions. It allows the dryer to create steam. This steam loosens fabric fibers. It helps to smooth out creases. It also removes odors from clothes. You can quickly refresh items without a full wash. This is perfect for clothes worn once or stored away.

## Benefits of Steam Functions for Your Laundry

The cold water connection on your Samsung dryer unlocks powerful features. These steam functions offer many benefits. They improve your laundry routine. They also help care for your clothes. Let me tell you about some key advantages.
