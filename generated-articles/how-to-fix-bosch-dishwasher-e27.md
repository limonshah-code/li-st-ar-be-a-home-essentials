The Bosch dishwasher E27 error indicates a heating system fault. This usually points to a problem with the heating element, the thermistor (temperature sensor), or the circulation pump. You can often fix this error by testing and replacing these specific components yourself.

## Understanding the Bosch Dishwasher E27 Error

Your Bosch dishwasher shows an E27 error code. This code points to a specific issue. It indicates that the appliance struggles with its heating function. The water in the dishwasher is not reaching the correct temperature. This problem affects how well your dishwasher cleans. It can also cause dishes to come out cold or dirty.

Modern dishwashers need hot water to clean effectively. Hot water helps remove grease and food particles. It also helps with proper drying. When the E27 code appears, your dishwasher stops mid-cycle. It waits for the water to heat up. If it cannot heat the water, it displays the error and stops the cycle. This error prevents the dishwasher from completing its task.

The E27 error is often related to several key components. These include the heating element, the thermistor, or the flow sensor. Sometimes, a problem with the circulation pump can also trigger this code. The dishwasher's control board monitors these parts. If it detects a fault in the heating circuit, it displays E27. You can fix many of these issues with some basic tools and knowledge.

The E27 error differs from other common Bosch error codes. For example, the [Bosch dishwasher E09 error](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-bosch-dishwasher-e09) also relates to heating. However, E09 specifically points to a problem with the flow-through heater itself. E27 is a broader heating system fault. This means E27 can have more potential causes. Understanding these differences helps in correct diagnosis. It ensures you address the right part of your appliance.

## Safety First: Before You Start Bosch Dishwasher E27 Repair

Before you fix your Bosch dishwasher E27 error, prioritize safety. Dishwashers use electricity and water. This combination can be dangerous if you are not careful. Always take precautions before you begin any repair work. Following safety steps protects you from harm. It also prevents further damage to your appliance.

First, disconnect power from the dishwasher. Find the circuit breaker that controls your kitchen outlets. Flip it to the "off" position. You can also unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet directly. Ensure the power is completely off before touching any internal parts. This step prevents electric shock. I always double-check the power is off before I grab any tools.

Next, turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. Locate the water shut-off valve. This valve is often under the sink near the dishwasher's water line. Turn the valve clockwise until it is fully closed. This prevents water leaks while you work. It also stops water from flowing if you disconnect a hose. Draining any remaining water from the dishwasher is also a good idea. You can often do this by running a short drain cycle if the machine still allows it.

Gather the right tools for the job. You will likely need basic tools like screwdrivers (Phillips and flathead), pliers, and a multimeter. A multimeter helps test electrical components for continuity. This is important for checking heating elements and sensors. Have a towel or bucket ready for any water spills. Proper tools make the job easier and safer.

Finally, access the dishwasher's internal components carefully. Depending on your Bosch model, you may need to [remove the top of the Bosch dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-bosch-dishwasher-top) or access it from the kickplate area. Follow your dishwasher's manual for specific access instructions. Take your time. Do not force any parts. Being gentle prevents damage. Always refer to your appliance's user manual for model-specific safety notes.

## Diagnosing the Heating Element for E27 Error

The heating element is a common cause of the Bosch dishwasher E27 error. This part heats the water inside the appliance. If it fails, the dishwasher cannot reach the correct temperature. This triggers the E27 code. Checking the heating element is an important first step in troubleshooting.

First, locate the heating element. In many Bosch dishwashers, the heating element is not visible inside the tub. Instead, Bosch uses a "flow-through" heater or an in-line heating element. This component is usually located underneath the dishwasher, near the circulation pump. You will need to pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet or tilt it back to access the bottom. I recommend placing a towel down first to catch any water.

Once you find the heating element, visually inspect it. Look for any signs of damage. This includes cracks, corrosion, or burnt spots. A visibly damaged element likely needs replacement. However, sometimes the damage is not visible. So, you need to test it with a multimeter. This test checks for electrical continuity.

To test the heating element, disconnect its wires. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. Place one probe on each terminal of the heating element. A working heating element should show a resistance reading. This reading typically falls between 10 to 30 ohms. If your multimeter shows "OL" (open loop) or an infinite reading, the element has no continuity. This means it is broken. In this case, you need to replace the heating element.

Replacing a faulty heating element usually involves unscrewing a few mounting brackets. Then, you disconnect the old element and connect the new one. Ensure you connect the wires correctly. Follow the exact wiring pattern of the old element. A new heating element often resolves the E27 error. Remember that Bosch dishwashers sometimes combine the heating element with the circulation pump. If you find a combined unit, you may need to replace both components.

## Checking the Thermistor/Temperature Sensor

After checking the heating element, the next part to inspect for the Bosch dishwasher E27 error is the thermistor. This component is also known as the temperature sensor. The thermistor monitors the water temperature inside the dishwasher. It sends this temperature information to the control board. If the thermistor gives inaccurate readings or fails, the dishwasher cannot correctly heat the water. This can trigger the E27 code.

Locating the thermistor is usually straightforward. In many Bosch models, the thermistor is near the heating element or attached to the sump area. You may need to remove the lower spray arm and the filter assembly to access it. Sometimes, it is part of the flow-through heater unit. Refer to your dishwasher's service manual for the exact location for your model. I find having the manual handy saves a lot of time and frustration.

Once you locate the thermistor, disconnect its wires. You will then use a multimeter to test its resistance. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. Place the probes on the thermistor's terminals. A thermistor's resistance changes with temperature. At room temperature (around 70°F or 21°C), a functional thermistor should show a specific resistance value. This value varies by model, but it is often in the thousands of ohms (e.g., 10kΩ to 50kΩ). You might need to check your service manual for the exact resistance specification for your Bosch model.

If the thermistor shows an "OL" (open loop) reading or a resistance that is far off from the specification, it is likely faulty. A bad thermistor cannot tell the control board the correct water temperature. This leads the dishwasher to believe there is a heating problem. In this situation, replacing the thermistor is necessary. Installing a new thermistor typically involves simple steps. You just unclip the old one and clip in the new one. Then you reattach the wires.

After replacing the thermistor, reassemble the dishwasher. Run a test cycle. The E27 error should clear if the thermistor was the problem. If the error persists, you should continue troubleshooting other components in the heating system. This step is crucial for accurate diagnosis.

## Inspecting the Flow-Through Heater and Circulation Pump

For the Bosch dishwasher E27 error, you also need to inspect the flow-through heater and the circulation pump. These two components work together closely in Bosch dishwashers. They are critical for both water circulation and heating. A fault in either can lead to heating issues and trigger the E27 code.

Bosch dishwashers often use a flow-through heater. This heater is a more compact design than traditional coil heaters. It heats water as it passes through a chamber. This design is efficient but can fail. This failure can cause the E27 error. You should inspect the flow-through heater for blockages or damage. Sometimes, mineral buildup can clog the heater, preventing proper water flow and heating. This issue is similar to the problems that can cause a [Bosch dishwasher not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-bosch-dishwasher-not-draining) properly.

The circulation pump pushes water through the dishwasher. This water flows to the spray arms and also through the flow-through heater. If the circulation pump is faulty, water may not reach the heater at all. Or, it may not flow through it properly. This lack of circulation means the water cannot be heated effectively. You can usually find the circulation pump assembly underneath the dishwasher tub. It is often integrated with the heating element and sometimes even the thermistor.

You can test the circulation pump for electrical continuity using a multimeter. Disconnect the pump's power wires. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. Place the probes on the pump terminals. The resistance reading should fall within a specific range, usually indicated in your appliance's service manual. If it shows "OL" or no continuity, the pump motor is likely bad. You can also listen for the pump during a wash cycle. A humming noise without water movement suggests an impeller problem or a seized motor. If you notice your [Bosch dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-bosch-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom), it could also be a pump or drain issue.

Before replacing the pump, check for any obstructions. Food debris or foreign objects can sometimes get lodged in the impeller. This prevents the pump from spinning freely. You may need to [clean the Bosch dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bosch-dishwasher-pump) to resolve this. If the pump assembly, including the flow-through heater, needs replacement, ensure you get the correct part number for your specific Bosch model. Replacing this combined unit can be more involved. However, it often resolves heating and circulation issues simultaneously.

## Addressing Water Pressure and Flow Issues

Sometimes, the Bosch dishwasher E27 error is not directly about a faulty heating component. It can result from insufficient water pressure or flow. The dishwasher needs enough water to circulate and heat properly. If the water supply is restricted, the heating system may not work correctly. This can cause the E27 error. It is worth checking these aspects before replacing expensive parts.

First, check the water inlet valve. This valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. If it is partially clogged or faulty, it might not let enough water in. You can inspect the screen filter on the inlet valve for debris. Turn off the water supply and disconnect the water line to do this. Clean any sediment or mineral buildup you find. This simple cleaning can often improve water flow. Sometimes, the valve itself fails electrically. You can test it with a multimeter for continuity, or you can listen for a click when the dishwasher tries to fill. No click suggests an electrical problem or a faulty valve.

Next, examine the dishwasher's filters. A clogged filter system can significantly restrict water flow inside the tub. This prevents water from reaching the heating element or thermistor correctly. Bosch dishwashers have a multi-part filter system, usually located at the bottom of the tub. Regularly [cleaning your Bosch dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-bosch-dishwasher-filter) is crucial for performance. Remove the coarse and fine filters. Rinse them thoroughly under running water. Use a brush to remove stubborn food particles and grease. A clean filter ensures proper water circulation.

Check the spray arms for clogs. The tiny holes in the spray arms can become blocked with food debris. This reduces water pressure and distribution. If water cannot spray correctly, the heating element might not sense enough water. This can lead to the E27 error. Remove the spray arms. Use a thin wire or toothpick to clear any blocked holes. Run water through them to ensure they spray evenly.

Finally, consider your home's water pressure. Low house water pressure can affect how your dishwasher fills and operates. If you notice low pressure in other faucets in your home, it might be a general plumbing issue. This is less common for an E27 error directly. However, it can affect the overall performance. Ensuring good water pressure and clear water pathways can often resolve mysterious heating issues. If your dishwasher struggles to fill, it can also lead to issues where you need to [fix a Bosch dishwasher check water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-bosch-dishwasher-check-water) error.

## Resetting Your Bosch Dishwasher and Further Steps

After you have checked components or made a repair, resetting your Bosch dishwasher is often necessary. A reset can clear error codes from the control board's memory. This lets you see if your repair fixed the E27 issue. Resetting also helps if the E27 error appeared due to a temporary glitch. It is a simple step to try before delving into complex repairs.

To reset a Bosch dishwasher, you usually perform a hard reset. First, turn off the dishwasher at the power outlet or by flipping its circuit breaker. Leave it unplugged or off for at least 5-10 minutes. This period allows the control board to fully discharge and clear its temporary memory. After the waiting period, restore power to the dishwasher. Then, try running a short cycle. Observe if the E27 error code reappears. If the error clears and the dishwasher runs normally, your troubleshooting or repair was successful.

If the E27 error persists after checking all the mentioned components and performing a reset, there are further steps. The issue might be with the main control board. The control board interprets signals from sensors and sends power to components. A faulty control board might incorrectly read the thermistor or fail to send power to the heating element. Testing a control board is complex. It usually requires professional diagnostic tools. Replacing it is often expensive. I recommend consulting an expert if you suspect the control board.

Before calling a professional, ensure you have checked everything thoroughly. Double-check all connections you made during your repairs. Ensure wires are secure and components are properly installed. Sometimes, a loose connection can mimic a faulty part. Running a cleaning cycle can also help. A dirty dishwasher can sometimes struggle with proper operation.
