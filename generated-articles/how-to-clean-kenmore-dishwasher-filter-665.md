## Understanding Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter 665

Your Kenmore dishwasher model 665 relies on a filter system. This system catches food scraps and debris. Without it, these particles would recirculate. They would redeposit onto your "clean" dishes. Most Kenmore dishwashers use a two-part filter. There is a coarse filter and a fine filter. The coarse filter is usually a larger cup. It traps bigger food pieces. The fine filter is a mesh screen. It catches smaller particles. Both parts must be clean to work correctly. Ignoring the filter leads to problems. You might see cloudy glassware or food residue on plates. Bad smells can also come from a dirty filter. I have certainly experienced this myself.

Understanding the filter's role helps us care for it. It protects the pump and drain. A clean filter allows water to drain properly. It also ensures proper water circulation. This is key for effective cleaning cycles. Knowing where your filter is located is the first step. It is typically found at the bottom of the wash tub. Look near the spray arm. Some models may require removing the lower spray arm first. Always check your specific model's manual. This ensures you handle the filter correctly. Proper care extends your dishwasher's life. It saves you from costly repairs too.

## Locating and Accessing the Filter Assembly

Finding the filter in your Kenmore 665 dishwasher is straightforward. Open the dishwasher door fully. Look at the very bottom of the tub. You will see a round or cylindrical component. This is your filter assembly. It usually sits in the center or slightly to one side. Sometimes, it might be beneath the lower spray arm. If so, you may need to remove the lower spray arm first. This is usually simple to do. Just lift it up and pull it off its post. Some models might twist off.

The filter assembly often has two parts. There is an upper filter, or coarse filter. This looks like a cup or basket. Below it, you will find a fine mesh filter. This part is typically flat. It sits flush with the bottom of the tub. To remove the filter, you usually twist the upper part. Turn it counter-clockwise. You will feel it disengage. Once unlocked, you can lift the entire assembly out. Always be gentle when doing this. You do not want to damage the plastic components. It is important to know where your specific model's filter is. Some Kenmore Elite models might have slightly different filter locations or removal methods.

Before touching the filter, always make sure the dishwasher is off. Disconnect power if you are unsure. This is for your safety. Removing the filter might cause some water to leak out. This is normal. It is just residual water in the drain system. Have a small towel ready. This will catch any drips. Accessing the filter is the first critical step. It prepares you for the cleaning process.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Removing the Filter

Removing the Kenmore 665 dishwasher filter is a simple task. First, ensure your dishwasher is completely empty. Turn off the dishwasher power. This is a safety precaution. Locate the filter assembly at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It usually consists of two parts. You will see a cylindrical top part, which is the coarse filter. Underneath it is a flat, fine mesh filter.

To begin removal, grasp the cylindrical coarse filter. This part often has a handle or small tabs for gripping. Twist this part counter-clockwise. You will feel it disengage. Lift it straight up and out of the dishwasher. Sometimes, the fine mesh filter will come out with it. Other times, the fine filter remains in place. If it stays, you will need to remove it separately. The fine mesh filter is often flat. It sits flush with the bottom. There might be a small tab or indentation to help lift it. Gently pull it up to remove it.

Be careful as you remove these parts. They might contain standing water or food debris. You do not want to spill this inside your dishwasher. Place them on a towel or in a sink. I always have a paper towel ready for this step. Remember the orientation of the filter pieces. This will help you later during reinstallation.
