## Understanding Grease Buildup on Cooking Pans

Grease buildup on cooking pans is a common kitchen issue. It forms from cooking oils and food fats. When you heat oil, it can splatter and bake onto the pan's surface. Over time, these layers of grease accumulate. They become sticky and hard to remove.

Non-stick pans need gentle cleaning to avoid damage. Copper pans can develop a patina. This patina mixes with grease. Knowing your pan material helps choose the best cleaning approach. Many resources explain [what is cooking pan made out of](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-cooking-pan-made-out-of), which influences cleaning methods.
