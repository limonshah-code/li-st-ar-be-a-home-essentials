Changing the time on your GE microwave from military to standard format is usually straightforward. While exact button names might differ slightly, the process is largely consistent across models. I will walk you through the most common method. This process should resolve the issue for most GE microwave owners.

#### 1. Locating the Clock or Time Set Button

First, you need to find the correct button on your microwave's control panel. Look for a button labeled "Clock," "Time Set," or sometimes "Options." This button is the gateway to changing any time-related settings. It is usually located near the numeric keypad or cooking functions. If your microwave has no explicit "Clock" button, it might be integrated. Some models require pressing "Settings" or "Tools" first.

#### 2. Initiating the Time Setting Mode

Once you locate the button, press it once. The display will likely change. You might see "SET CLOCK," "TIME," or numbers blinking. Some GE models require you to press the "Clock" button twice. This action often cycles between "SET CLOCK" and the 12/24-hour format option. Watch the display carefully for these changes.

#### 3. Selecting 12-Hour Format

This is the crucial step for changing from military time. After pressing "Clock" (possibly twice), the display might show "12H" or "24H." It might also show "AM/PM" or just "24." If it shows "24H" or "24," press the "Clock" button again. This action typically toggles it to "12H" or enables the AM/PM indicator. Some models use a specific number key for this. For example, pressing "1" might select 12-hour mode.

#### 4. Entering the Current Time

With the 12-hour format selected, or once the display is ready, enter the current time using the numeric keypad. For instance, for 3:45 PM, enter "0345." The microwave will automatically determine if it is AM or PM based on the format you selected. If it is 12-hour format, you should see the AM/PM indicator. If you have a GE microwave with no explicit clock button, the process might vary. Learn how to [set time on GE microwave with no clock button](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-set-time-on-ge-microwave-with-no-clock-button) for specific guidance.

### Why Does My GE Microwave Keep Reverting to Military Time?

It can be frustrating when you set your GE microwave to standard time, only for it to revert to military time later. This issue is more common than you might think. Several factors can cause your microwave to reset its clock settings. Understanding these reasons helps you address the problem effectively. I will explain why this might be happening.

#### 1. Power Interruption or Fluctuations

The most common reason for a clock reset is a loss of power. Even a brief power flicker can cause your microwave's internal clock to reset. Many microwaves default to military time (24-hour format) upon a hard reset. If your home experiences frequent, short power outages, your microwave will revert. Installing a surge protector can help mitigate effects from minor power fluctuations. However, a complete blackout will always reset the clock. If your [GE microwave keeps shutting off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-microwave-keep-shutting-off) intermittently, this is likely the cause of resets.

#### 2. Faulty Internal Capacitor or Battery

Some electronic appliances have an internal capacitor or a small battery. These components provide backup power to maintain the clock settings during brief power interruptions. If this capacitor or battery degrades or fails, the clock loses its memory immediately. Any power loss, even for a second, will cause a reset. This is a common issue in older microwaves. Replacing this component is a complex repair and usually requires a technician.

#### 3. Control Board Malfunction

The control board is the "brain" of your microwave. It manages all functions, including the clock. If the control board is faulty, it might struggle to retain settings. A defective control board could randomly reset the clock to its factory default. This default might be military time. Symptoms of a failing control board can also include erratic button responses or unusual display behavior. If your [GE microwave turns on but does not heat up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-microwave-turn-on-but-not-heat-up), it often indicates a control board issue.

#### 4. User Error in Saving Settings

Sometimes, the issue is simpler: the settings were not saved correctly. After entering the time and selecting the 12-hour format, you must confirm the setting. Many GE microwaves require pressing the "Clock" or "Start" button one last time to save. If you skip this final step or press the wrong button, the changes will not stick. When the microwave powers down or enters standby, it reverts to the last saved setting, which might be military time. Always double-check your owner's manual for the precise save command.

#### 5. Software Glitch

Less commonly, a software glitch within the microwave's firmware could cause the reset. These glitches are rare but can occur. They typically require a reset of the entire system or a firmware update. A complete power cycle (unplugging for several minutes) can sometimes resolve minor software issues. Persistent software problems usually necessitate professional service.

If your GE microwave consistently reverts to military time, review these potential causes. Starting with power stability and user saving steps is best. If the problem persists, consider a professional diagnosis.

### Understanding Time Zone and DST Settings on Your GE Microwave (If Applicable)

Some advanced GE microwave models offer more than just 12/24-hour format. They might include options for time zones or Daylight Saving Time (DST) adjustments. These features add convenience but can also impact your clock display. Knowing if your model has these helps you manage its time settings better. I will explain these less common, but useful, functionalities.

#### Time Zone Adjustments

Certain high-end GE appliances, especially those connected to smart home systems, might have time zone settings. This feature allows you to select your geographical time zone. The microwave then automatically adjusts its clock if you move or if it connects to an online time server. For most standard GE microwaves, this feature is not present. Their clocks are set manually and do not automatically account for different time zones. Always check your specific model's manual to see if it supports time zone selection.

#### Daylight Saving Time (DST) Feature

A few GE microwave models include an automatic Daylight Saving Time (DST) adjustment. This means the microwave can automatically spring forward or fall back an hour. This eliminates the need for manual adjustment twice a year. If your microwave has this feature, it is usually found within the "Clock Settings" or "Options" menu. You can typically enable or disable this automatic adjustment. If enabled, the microwave will change its time by itself during DST transitions. If disabled, you will need to manually adjust the time like a standard clock.

#### How These Settings Affect Your Clock

If your GE microwave has time zone or DST features, they work alongside the 12/24-hour format. For instance, if your DST setting is enabled and your time zone is incorrectly set, your clock might display the wrong time. This would happen even if you have successfully changed from military time. You would see the correct format (12-hour) but the wrong hour. Always ensure these secondary time settings match your location and preferences.

#### Checking for Advanced Time Features

To see if your GE microwave supports these advanced time features, consult your owner's manual. Look for keywords like "Time Zone," "Daylight Saving Time," or "Automatic Time Adjustment." If these features are present, the manual will provide clear instructions on how to access and manage them. For most standard GE microwaves, you will only deal with setting the current time and the 12/24-hour format. These simpler models rely solely on your manual input for time accuracy.

Understanding these features ensures your GE microwave always displays the precise time.
