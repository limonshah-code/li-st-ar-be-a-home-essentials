Making a mattress is a detailed process. It combines craftsmanship with modern technology. For Symbol Mattress, this journey starts with raw materials. It ends with a finished bed ready for your home. Each step focuses on precision and quality. This process is consistent across their US manufacturing network.

The first step involves preparing the core components. Steel coils are formed for innerspring units. Foam blocks are cut into precise layers. Fabric covers are sewn to size. These elements are then brought together for assembly. The specific steps depend on the mattress type being made.

### Innerspring Construction

Innerspring mattresses are a classic choice. They start with a robust coil system.

### Foam Layer Integration

Comfort layers are crucial for feel and pressure relief.
*   **Layering:** Various foams are stacked in specific order. This creates the desired softness, firmness, and contouring. Memory foam, gel foam, and conventional foam are common.
*   **Adhesion:** Safe, water-based adhesives bond the layers. This prevents shifting. It ensures the mattress holds its shape.

### Finishing Touches and Inspection

The final steps ensure the mattress looks good and performs well.
*   **Quilting:** The top fabric is quilted to comfort materials. This creates a soft sleep surface. It also secures the upper layers.
*   **Closing:** The mattress is fully upholstered. Side panels and bottom fabric are attached.
*   **Final Inspection:** Each mattress undergoes a thorough check. Workers look for flaws in stitching, alignment, and overall appearance. This step ensures every Symbol Mattress meets quality standards before shipping.

This careful journey ensures a high-quality product reaches consumers. The manufacturing process balances efficiency with attention to detail.
