A dishwasher failing to drain often stems from simple obstructions like food particles in the filter or a kinked drain hose. More complex issues include a faulty drain pump, a clogged air gap, or problems with the garbage disposal connection. Identifying the specific cause helps you choose the right repair.

## Clogged Dishwasher Filter and Sump Area

One common reason your dishwasher will not drain is a clogged filter. Over time, food scraps, grease, and debris accumulate in the filter. This buildup blocks water from reaching the drain pump effectively. A dirty filter makes the dishwasher work harder without success. Cleaning it regularly prevents many drainage issues.

You can usually find the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher, below the spray arm. It is designed to catch larger particles. If this filter gets too full, water cannot pass through it to the drain. This means dirty water stays inside the tub after a cycle finishes. Cleaning this part is a simple first step in troubleshooting.

To clean the filter, remove the lower dish rack. Twist or lift out the filter assembly. Rinse it under running water to remove all debris. Use a soft brush or sponge to clean off stubborn grime. Make sure the filter is completely clear before putting it back. This simple act often solves the drainage problem immediately. For more detailed instructions, you can learn [how to clean your dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain).

The sump area sits directly below the filter. This area can also collect food particles and grease. Even with a clean filter, debris in the sump can hinder drainage. A flashlight helps you see if anything is blocking the opening. Clear any visible obstructions with your hand or a small tool. Keeping both the filter and sump clear is crucial.

Proper maintenance of these parts prolongs your dishwasher's life. It ensures efficient cleaning cycles. My experience shows that most drainage calls begin with a simple filter check. This quick task saves you time and money. Always consult your appliance manual for specific filter removal steps. Cleaning your [dishwasher filter and drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-and-drain) is a smart habit.

## Issues with the Drain Hose

The drain hose plays a critical role in removing water from your dishwasher. If your dishwasher does not drain, the hose might be the problem. A common issue is a kink in the hose. This often happens if the dishwasher moves slightly or during installation. Kinks restrict water flow, causing water to back up in the tub.

You can inspect the drain hose by pulling the dishwasher out slightly. Check the hose along its entire length. Straighten any bends or twists you find. The hose typically runs from the dishwasher to the garbage disposal or a dedicated drain. Ensure it has a high loop to prevent backflow of dirty water. This high loop is a critical installation detail.

Beyond kinks, the drain hose can also become clogged. Food particles, grease, and detergent residue build up inside. This buildup narrows the hose's diameter, blocking water passage. These clogs are harder to see from the outside. You might need to disconnect the hose to clear it. Be ready for some water to spill when you disconnect it.

To clear a clogged drain hose, first turn off the power to the dishwasher. Disconnect the hose from both ends. Use a long brush or snake to push through any blockages. You can also flush it with water in a utility sink. Make sure the hose is completely clear before reconnecting it. Reconnect the hose securely at both the dishwasher and the drain connection.

If you have a Samsung dishwasher that does not drain, the drain hose is a good place to start. Specific models might have unique hose configurations. Always refer to your appliance manual for detailed steps. Ensuring a clear, unkinked drain hose is a fundamental step. It often resolves drainage issues without needing a repair person. Understanding [how to get the dishwasher to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain) often involves checking this hose first.

## Malfunctioning Dishwasher Drain Pump

If your dishwasher will not drain, and you have checked the filter and hose, the drain pump might be faulty. The drain pump is an electric motor that pushes water out of the dishwasher. It uses an impeller to forcefully expel water through the drain hose. If the pump fails, water stays in the dishwasher tub. This is a more serious issue than a simple clog.

A drain pump can fail for several reasons. Sometimes, a hard object like a broken piece of glass or a bone fragment gets past the filter. This object can jam the impeller, stopping the pump from spinning. Other times, the motor itself can burn out. This happens due to age or overheating. A humming sound without water draining often indicates a jammed impeller. No sound at all might mean a dead motor.

Checking the drain pump involves accessing the pump assembly. This usually means pulling the dishwasher out from under the counter. You will need to remove the lower access panel. Locate the drain pump, which is typically at the bottom front. Inspect it for visible damage or obstructions. Before touching anything, always disconnect power to the dishwasher. Safety is paramount when dealing with electrical components.

If you find an obstruction, carefully remove it. Use pliers or a screwdriver if necessary. Be gentle to avoid damaging the impeller blades. If the pump runs but no water drains, it might have a cracked housing or a weak motor. If the pump does not make any sound, you can use a multimeter to test for continuity. A lack of continuity means the motor is likely bad.

Replacing a drain pump can be a complex task. It often requires specific tools and some technical skill. If you are not comfortable with appliance repair, it is best to call a professional. A new drain pump can extend the life of your dishwasher. Ignoring a bad pump can lead to standing water and possible overflow. Knowing [when your dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/when-dishwasher-does-not-drain) due to a pump issue helps you decide your next steps. For specific brands, like if your [Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-whirlpool-dishwasher), the pump is a key component to consider.

## Issues with the Air Gap or High Loop

Many dishwashers use an air gap device to prevent dirty water from flowing back into the clean water supply. The air gap is a small cylindrical fixture usually mounted on your kitchen counter or sink. If your dishwasher does not drain, a clogged air gap is a common culprit. Food debris or mineral deposits can build up inside it. This blocks the path for water to drain properly.

To check your air gap, first locate it. It typically sits near the faucet. Remove the cover by unscrewing or lifting it off. Look inside for any visible debris. You might see a black, slimy substance or hardened food particles. These blockages prevent air from entering the drain system. Without air, water cannot flow out due to vacuum pressure.

Cleaning the air gap is simple. Disconnect the hoses connected to its base. Use a wire brush or a pipe cleaner to clear out any gunk. Flush the air gap with water to ensure it is completely clear. Reconnect the hoses securely afterward. Test the dishwasher to see if the drainage issue resolves. This quick check can save you from a larger repair.

Not all dishwashers use an air gap. Many rely on a "high loop" in the drain hose instead. A high loop means the drain hose is routed upwards, forming a loop, before it connects to the sink drain or garbage disposal. This loop sits higher than the dishwasher's drain outlet. Its purpose is the same as an air gap: to prevent dirty drain water from siphoning back into the dishwasher.

If your dishwasher has a high loop instead of an air gap, ensure the loop remains intact. Check that the hose is properly secured at its highest point, usually under the countertop. If the hose sags, it loses its high loop function. This can cause slow draining or even backflow. Adjusting or securing the high loop can often fix drainage problems. Ensure that the high loop is as high as possible.

## Garbage Disposal Connection Problems

If your dishwasher will not drain, and you have a garbage disposal, the connection between the two might be the issue. Many dishwashers drain directly into the garbage disposal unit. If the disposal is clogged or improperly installed, it can prevent the dishwasher from draining. This is a very common oversight when troubleshooting.

The first thing to check is if the garbage disposal itself is clogged. Run your disposal with some cold water. If it drains slowly or makes a humming sound without grinding, it is probably clogged. Food waste can build up inside, blocking the dishwasher's drain line connection. Clearing the disposal often resolves the dishwasher's drainage problem.

A common installation error is forgetting to remove the "knock-out plug" from the new garbage disposal. When you install a new disposal, there is a small plug inside the dishwasher's drain port. This plug prevents leaks before the dishwasher is connected. If this plug is not removed, water from the dishwasher cannot enter the disposal. This results in standing water in the dishwasher.

To check for the knock-out plug, you need to disconnect the dishwasher's drain hose from the garbage disposal. Look inside the disposal's inlet where the hose connects. If you see a plastic plug, use a screwdriver and hammer to tap it out. Be careful to catch the plug so it does not fall into the disposal. Reconnect the hose securely.

Even with the plug removed, food particles can accumulate at this specific connection point. Over time, grease and small food scraps can create a blockage right at the hose's entry into the disposal. Disconnecting the hose and clearing any visible debris from both the hose end and the disposal port can help. This ensures a clear path for water to flow freely. Always run the disposal for a few seconds before starting the dishwasher cycle. This clears any lingering debris.

## Dishwasher Drain Valve Obstruction

Another reason your dishwasher may not drain is an obstructed drain valve. The drain valve controls the flow of water out of the dishwasher. It opens when the drain pump activates, allowing water to exit. If this valve gets stuck or blocked, water cannot escape. This can leave standing water in the bottom of your appliance.

The drain valve can become obstructed by small food particles or debris. Sometimes, hardened detergent residue can also cause it to stick. These obstructions prevent the valve from opening fully. A partially open valve slows drainage. A completely stuck valve stops drainage altogether. This can be tricky to diagnose without some disassembly.

Accessing the drain valve usually requires removing the lower spray arm and filter assembly. The valve is typically located near the drain pump or in the sump area. Once visible, inspect it for any foreign objects. Small pieces of glass, plastic, or even a bone can cause the blockage. You might need a flashlight to see clearly inside the sump.

Carefully remove any visible obstructions. You can use tweezers or needle-nose pliers for stubborn pieces. After clearing debris, manually check if the valve moves freely. It should open and close without resistance. If the valve itself is broken or corroded, it may need replacement. A faulty valve will not respond correctly to the drain pump's signal.

A non-functioning drain valve requires a replacement part. This repair can be involved. It often means disconnecting water and power lines and pulling the dishwasher out. If you are not comfortable performing this task, consider contacting an appliance repair technician. A professional can quickly diagnose and replace a faulty drain valve. Ensuring this valve operates properly is essential for efficient drainage. This part is critical for allowing your dishwasher to effectively remove water.

## Detergent and Hard Water Buildup

Detergent and hard water can contribute to drainage problems over time. If your dishwasher does not drain, consider the long-term effects of these common issues. Detergent, especially in powder or liquid form, can leave residue. This residue combines with minerals from hard water. The result is a sticky film that coats internal components.

This film often collects in the drain hose, sump, and filter. It acts like a magnet for food particles. Over time, this buildup hardens into a thick sludge. This sludge restricts water flow through the drain system. It can also cause the drain valve to stick. This problem often develops slowly, leading to gradually worsening drainage. My own dishwasher once had this problem, and it was a real surprise how much buildup had occurred.

Using too much detergent can worsen this issue. Excess soap creates more suds. These suds can overflow into the drain hose. They leave more residue behind. Using the correct amount of detergent for your water hardness is important. If you have soft water, you need less detergent. Hard water requires a bit more, but too much is still a problem. [Can dishwasher pods cause clogs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-dishwasher-pods-cause-clogs)? Yes, sometimes, especially if they do not dissolve completely.

To combat this buildup, regular cleaning is vital. Run a cleaning cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or white vinegar. Place a cup of white vinegar on the top rack. Run an empty hot water cycle. The vinegar helps dissolve mineral deposits and soap scum. You can also sprinkle baking soda in the bottom before the cycle. This helps to neutralize odors and cut through grease.

For severe buildup, you might need to manually clean affected parts. This includes scrubbing the filter, sump, and the accessible parts of the drain hose. Regular maintenance prevents these issues from escalating. It ensures your dishwasher drains freely and cleans dishes effectively. Understanding the role of water quality and detergent use is key. It helps maintain appliance health and prevents future drainage problems.
