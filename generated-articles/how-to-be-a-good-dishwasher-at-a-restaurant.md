#### The Importance of Pre-Scraping

Pre-scraping is a crucial first step. It involves removing all food particles from dishes. You use a rubber scraper or a spray nozzle. Do this before loading dishes into the machine.

Organize incoming dishes. Create separate areas for different items. Plates go here, glasses there, silverware in another spot. This sorting makes loading the machine much faster.

#### Developing a Consistent Flow

A consistent flow helps you maintain speed. Find a rhythm that works for you. This means moving from scraping to rinsing to loading without interruption. Avoid distractions.
