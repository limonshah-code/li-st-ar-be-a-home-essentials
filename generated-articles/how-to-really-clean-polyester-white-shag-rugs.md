This material also boasts good stain and fade resistance compared to some natural fibers like wool. However, the white color and shag construction present specific cleaning challenges. The synthetic nature of polyester can sometimes attract oily stains more readily than other dirt. This happens because polyester is a plastic-based fiber.

It also means spilled liquids can spread widely and quickly, absorbing into many fibers. White rugs, by their very nature, show every single bit of dirt, discoloration, or pet hair. This combination demands a specific cleaning approach. You need methods that effectively lift dirt without damaging the delicate, long fibers. It is important to know your rug's material properties.
