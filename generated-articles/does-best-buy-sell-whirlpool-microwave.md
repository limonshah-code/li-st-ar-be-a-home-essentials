## Maintaining Your Whirlpool Microwave for Longevity

Once you own a Whirlpool microwave, proper maintenance helps it last longer. Simple care steps keep your appliance working well. Regular cleaning is the first and most important step. A clean microwave performs better and prevents odors.

Heat it for a few minutes until it steams. The steam will loosen the grime. Then, you can easily wipe the interior clean. Always clean up spills immediately. This prevents food from baking onto the surfaces.

Avoid running the microwave when it is empty. This can damage internal components. Only use microwave-safe dishes. Metal containers or dishes with metallic trim can cause sparks. This can harm the microwave and be dangerous. Always check labels on dishes to ensure they are microwave safe.

If your microwave starts acting unusually, a quick check can often fix it. For instance, sometimes microwaves beep for various reasons.
