## Safely Get Water Out of Your Samsung Washing Machine

Having a Samsung washing machine full of standing water is frustrating. This common problem stops your laundry day. It can even lead to odors and potential damage. Knowing **how to get water out of Samsung washing machine** models is a valuable skill. This guide helps you clear the water safely and effectively.

I will walk you through the necessary steps. We will cover everything from basic checks to manual draining. Understanding the process prevents bigger issues. You will gain confidence in handling this situation. Let us ensure your Samsung washing machine works correctly again.

### Takeaway

When your Samsung washing machine holds water, take these immediate actions:

*   Unplug the machine from power.
*   Turn off the water supply valves.
*   Locate the drain pump filter and prepare for water release.
*   Manually drain the water using the filter hose or drain hose.
*   Check for clogs in the filter and hoses.

### Clear Answer

To get water out of a Samsung washing machine, first unplug it and turn off the water supply. Then, locate the drain pump filter at the bottom front. Place a shallow pan and towels, open the drain plug to release water, and clear any debris from the filter. Finally, check the main drain hose for kinks or clogs.

## Understanding Why Your Samsung Washer Has Standing Water

A Samsung washing machine full of water indicates a drainage problem. Several issues can cause this common fault. We need to identify the root cause to fix it properly. Understanding these reasons helps you prevent future occurrences. I want to explain each potential cause clearly.

One frequent reason is a clogged drain pump filter. This filter traps lint, coins, and small items. Over time, these items build up. They block water from leaving the machine. My own experience tells me this is often the first place to check.

Another issue involves the drain hose. The hose can become kinked or bent. This prevents water flow. Objects might also block the hose internally. Sometimes, the hose position is too low, causing a siphoning effect. Check the hose at the back of the machine.

The drain pump itself can fail. This internal component pushes water out. If it is broken or worn, water stays inside. You might hear a humming noise without water moving. This signals a pump problem.

Finally, an electrical or software glitch can stop the drain cycle. Your machine might display an error code. Resetting the machine sometimes resolves these issues. Knowing why your washer holds water directs your troubleshooting efforts effectively.

## Essential Safety Measures Before You Start

Safety always comes first when dealing with appliances. Water and electricity are a dangerous combination. Before attempting to **get water out of your Samsung washing machine**, you must take precautions. These steps protect you from electric shock. They also prevent further damage to your machine or home.

First, unplug the washing machine from its power outlet. This cuts all electrical supply. Do not just turn off the machine; remove the plug completely. This step is non-negotiable. It ensures no current flows during your work.

Next, turn off the water supply. Locate the hot and cold water valves behind the washer. Turn them clockwise until tight. This prevents more water from entering the machine. You can find detailed instructions on [how to turn off water to washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-off-water-to-washing-machine). This prevents a larger flood.

Prepare your workspace. Place old towels or absorbent mats on the floor around the washing machine. Have a shallow pan or bucket ready. This collects the water you drain from the machine. Spills are inevitable. Being prepared minimizes mess.

Wear protective gloves. The water can be dirty or contain detergent residue. Gloves protect your hands. These safety measures ensure a safe and clean process. Always prioritize your well-being when troubleshooting appliance issues.

## Draining Water Through the Drain Pump Filter

Draining water through the drain pump filter is the most common method. This technique works for most Samsung washing machine models. It helps you **get water out of Samsung washing machine** when it fails to drain. This process requires patience and preparation. I will guide you through each step.

First, locate the drain pump filter access panel. It is usually at the bottom front of your washing machine. You might need to open a small door or remove a kick panel. Consult your Samsung owner's manual if you cannot find it. This step is crucial for gaining access.

Once you find the panel, lay down towels and place a shallow container underneath. This container will catch the draining water. Remember, even a small amount of water can cause a mess. You may need to empty the container multiple times. A low-profile baking pan works well here.

Next, find the small drain hose, often capped or plugged. Gently pull it out and remove the cap or plug. Water will start to flow out. Direct this water into your container. You might need to hold the hose to control the flow. Be ready to re-cap the hose quickly if the container fills up. This method is a reliable way to [drain water from Samsung washing machine manually](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-water-from-samsung-washing-machine-manually).

After the initial draining, slowly twist open the large drain pump filter cap. More water will come out, so keep your container ready. Carefully remove the filter completely. Inspect it for any debris, such as lint, coins, or buttons. Clean the filter thoroughly under running water. Reinsert the clean filter and cap, then close the drain hose. This clears a common cause of drainage issues.

## Clearing Clogs and Blockages in the Drain Pump Filter

A clogged drain pump filter is a leading cause of standing water. Regularly cleaning this filter prevents drainage problems. If your Samsung washing machine has standing water, clearing this blockage is vital. I can help you understand this process. This step directly helps to **get water out of Samsung washing machine**.

First, access the drain pump filter. This panel is at the bottom front of your Samsung washer. You might need a screwdriver for some models. Open the small access door. You will see a small drain hose and the larger filter cap.

Before you remove the filter, drain as much water as possible using the small hose. As I mentioned earlier, use a shallow pan and towels. This minimizes spillage when you remove the main filter. When the water flow stops, you can proceed to the next step. If you need help finding it, refer to [where is the filter on a Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-filter-on-a-samsung-washing-machine).

Now, carefully unscrew the large drain pump filter cap counter-clockwise. Be prepared for more water to come out. Once removed, inspect the filter. It often traps lint, hair, coins, or small garments. These items can severely restrict water flow. I have found all sorts of things in my filter.

Clean the filter thoroughly under warm running water. Use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to remove stubborn debris. Also, check the filter housing cavity for any objects. Sometimes, items bypass the filter and sit directly in the pump area. Make sure the area is completely clear. Then, screw the clean filter back into place tightly. Cap the small drain hose and close the access panel.

## Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose

If the drain pump filter is clean, the problem might lie with the drain hose. A blocked or kinked drain hose can also prevent water from leaving your Samsung washing machine. Checking this component is another crucial step to **get water out of Samsung washing machine**. This process is straightforward. I will guide you through inspecting and clearing it.

First, pull the washing machine away from the wall. You need full access to the back of the appliance. Remember to be gentle to avoid damaging connections. Always ensure the machine is unplugged and water supply turned off. This prevents any accidents.

Locate the drain hose. It is typically a corrugated plastic hose. It connects from the back of the washing machine to a standpipe or utility sink. Visually inspect the entire length of the hose. Look for any visible kinks, bends, or severe crimps. Straighten any sections that appear restricted.

Next, disconnect the drain hose from the standpipe or sink. Have a bucket ready as more water may exit the hose. Lower the end of the hose to the floor into the bucket. Gravity will help drain any remaining water from the hose and the tub. This action often helps [drain your Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-your-samsung-washing-machine) significantly.

If water does not flow freely, the hose might have an internal blockage. You can try to clear it using a long, flexible brush. Alternatively, detach the hose completely from the washing machine. Then, run water through it from a faucet. This helps dislodge any clogs. If the hose is damaged or cannot be cleared, you may need to replace it. A clear drain hose is essential for proper drainage.

## Troubleshooting Drainage Issues and Error Codes

Sometimes, standing water is not just a simple clog. Your Samsung washing machine might show an error code or behave unusually. Understanding these signs helps you **get water out of Samsung washing machine** by addressing the core issue. I will discuss common troubleshooting steps. These can resolve deeper drainage problems.

First, check the error code displayed on your machine's panel. Samsung washing machines use specific codes for different issues. Refer to your owner's manual to decipher the code. Common drainage-related codes often point to pump or hose problems. Knowing the code provides a starting point for diagnosis.

A simple reset can sometimes clear a temporary glitch. To reset your Samsung washing machine, unplug it from the power outlet for a few minutes. Then, plug it back in. This can sometimes clear minor software issues. You can find more details on [how to reset Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-reset-samsung-washing machine). This often resolves minor electronic hiccups.

Ensure the washer is level. An unlevel machine can affect drainage sensor operation. Use a spirit level to check the top of your washer. Adjust the leveling feet if necessary. Proper leveling ensures the machine operates as intended. This might seem minor, but it can impact drainage.

Finally, consider the load size. Overloading your washing machine can sometimes prevent proper spinning and draining. The machine struggles to move water out of a very heavy, unbalanced load. Remove some items and try a smaller drain/spin cycle. If problems persist after these steps, the drain pump itself might be faulty. This would require professional service.

## Specific Methods for Samsung Top Load Washers

While many draining steps apply to all washing machines, Samsung top-load models have unique considerations. Understanding these specifics helps you **get water out of Samsung washing machine** top loaders more effectively. I want to highlight these differences for you. This ensures you handle your particular model correctly.

Samsung top-load washers often do not have an easily accessible drain pump filter at the front. The filter might be internal or part of the drain pump assembly. Therefore, the manual drain pump method might be less straightforward. If you cannot locate an external filter, you will rely more on the main drain hose.

For a top-load machine with standing water, start by checking the drain hose. Pull the washer out from the wall. Visually inspect the hose for kinks or blockages. Disconnect the hose from the standpipe or utility sink. Lower it into a bucket to drain water using gravity. This is a primary method for top-loaders. This specific method is detailed in our guide on [how to drain water from Samsung washing machine top load](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-water-from-samsung-washing-machine-top-load).

If the drain hose is clear and the machine still holds water, you might need to bail water out manually. Use a small cup or scoop to remove as much water as possible from the tub. Be careful not to spill water onto electrical components. This reduces the amount of water before you move the machine or check internal parts.

For persistent issues, the drain pump might be faulty. On top-load models, accessing the pump usually involves tilting the machine or removing back panels. This is a more involved repair. It may require a technician. Always ensure the machine is unplugged before attempting any internal access.

## When to Call a Professional for Drainage Issues

Most minor drainage issues can be resolved with DIY steps. However, some problems with **getting water out of your Samsung washing machine** require expert help. Knowing when to call a professional saves you time, effort, and potential damage. I will explain the situations that warrant a service call.

If you have tried all the troubleshooting steps, but water remains, it is time for a professional. You might have cleared the filter and drain hose. You might have even reset the machine. If the problem persists, it suggests a more complex internal fault. This could be a damaged drain pump or a faulty main control board. These components need specialized tools and knowledge to diagnose and replace.

If you are uncomfortable performing any of the manual draining or inspection steps, call a technician. Appliance repair can involve heavy lifting and working with electrical parts. Do not attempt a repair that makes you feel unsafe. Professionals have the training and safety equipment to handle these tasks. Your safety is paramount.

When your Samsung washing machine displays persistent error codes related to drainage, even after a reset, a professional is usually necessary. These codes often indicate specific component failures. A technician can quickly diagnose these. They can also order the correct replacement parts. This ensures a proper and lasting repair.

Finally, if you suspect internal damage or a leak, contact a professional immediately. Leaking water can cause significant damage to your home. It can also create electrical hazards. A professional can assess the damage and provide the best solution. They can also confirm if your issue requires [how to drain a Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-a-samsung-washing-machine) or a repair.
