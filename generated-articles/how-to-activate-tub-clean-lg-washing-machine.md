## Activating Tub Clean on Your LG Washing Machine for a Fresher Wash

Have you ever noticed a stale smell coming from your washing machine? Perhaps your clothes do not feel as fresh as they once did. Many homeowners face this common issue. Over time, detergent residue, fabric softener, and hard water minerals build up inside the washing machine tub. This creates an environment where mold and mildew thrive. It can lead to unpleasant odors and even affect the cleanliness of your laundry.

Fortunately, LG washing machines come with a fantastic feature designed to combat this problem: the Tub Clean cycle. This specialized cycle uses hot water and high spin speeds to wash away grime from the drum. Learning how to activate Tub Clean on your LG washing machine is simple. It is a vital step in maintaining your appliance. It also ensures your clothes come out truly clean and fresh. In this guide, I will show you how to start this important cycle. We will also cover essential tips for maintaining a sparkling clean washer.

### Takeaway

Keeping your LG washing machine clean ensures fresh laundry and a long appliance life.
*   Regularly run the Tub Clean cycle to remove buildup and odors.
*   Empty the washer completely before starting the cycle.
*   Add a suitable cleaning agent like bleach or a washing machine cleaner.
*   Wipe down the door seal and dispenser drawers after the cycle finishes.

To activate Tub Clean on your LG washing machine, ensure the drum is empty. Add a cleaning agent if desired. Select the "Tub Clean," "Cleaner," or "Sanitize" cycle on your control panel. Press "Start." The machine will run a specialized hot water cycle to clean the tub.

## Understanding LG's Tub Clean Feature and Its Importance

LG washing machines include a self-cleaning function known as Tub Clean. This feature helps remove mold, mildew, and detergent buildup from the inner drum. It runs a powerful cycle using very hot water. This hot water helps dissolve and wash away grime. The Tub Clean cycle keeps your washer fresh and free from odors.

Many people wonder what makes the Tub Clean cycle different. It is not a regular wash cycle. Instead, it focuses solely on the machine's interior. This special cycle uses no laundry detergent. It also runs without clothes in the tub. Regular use of Tub Clean prevents bacteria growth. It ensures your clothes come out truly clean.

### Why Tub Clean is Essential for Your Washing Machine

Running a Tub Clean cycle is vital for several reasons. First, it prevents unpleasant odors. These odors often come from mold and mildew that grow in damp areas. The Tub Clean cycle eliminates these sources. Second, it removes detergent and fabric softener residue. This residue can stick to the tub walls. Over time, it creates a sticky film. This film can transfer to your clothes.

Third, a clean tub improves washing performance. A machine free of buildup works more efficiently. Your clothes will get cleaner. They will also smell better. Finally, regular cleaning extends the life of your appliance. Preventing buildup reduces strain on internal components. This keeps your LG washing machine running smoothly for years. If you want to know more about this feature, you can find detailed information on [what is LG washing machine tub clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-lg-washing-machine-tub-clean).

### Common Signs Your Washer Needs a Tub Clean

Your washing machine will often tell you when it needs a clean. A musty smell is the most obvious sign. You might notice this smell on your clothes after a wash. Dark spots or a slimy film on the rubber gasket are also clear indicators. These are signs of mold and mildew. If your clothes do not feel truly clean, even after a wash, buildup might be the cause.

I always recommend checking the detergent dispenser too. If you see residue there, it is time for a Tub Clean. Stains on the inside of the drum are another sign. These stains might be from hard water minerals. Running the Tub Clean cycle helps remove these deposits. It keeps your washer looking and performing its best.

## Preparing Your LG Washer for a Tub Clean Cycle

Before you activate the Tub Clean cycle on your LG washing machine, some preparation steps are important. Proper preparation ensures the cycle works effectively. It helps you get the best cleaning results. Skipping these steps can reduce the cleaning power. It might leave some residue behind.

The first step is always to empty the washing machine. Make sure there are no clothes or other items inside the drum. The Tub Clean cycle is designed to clean the machine itself. It is not meant for laundry. Items left inside can get damaged. They can also interfere with the cleaning process.

### Emptying and Inspecting the Drum

Open the washer door and check inside. Remove any stray socks, small toys, or forgotten items. I always give the drum a quick visual inspection. Look for any visible grime or debris. If you see large pieces of lint or hair, wipe them away first. This prevents them from clogging the drain during the cycle.

A completely empty drum allows the hot water and cleaning agent to circulate freely. This free circulation reaches all areas of the tub. It ensures a thorough cleaning. It is a simple step, but it makes a big difference in the effectiveness of the Tub Clean cycle.

### Cleaning the Detergent Dispenser and Door Seal

The detergent dispenser and door seal are common spots for buildup. Before starting Tub Clean, clean these areas manually. Pull out the detergent dispenser drawer. Wash it with warm, soapy water. Use a small brush to clean out all compartments. Rinse it well and put it back. This removes old detergent and softener residue.

The rubber door seal (gasket) on front-load washers is a prime spot for mold. Wipe it down with a damp cloth. You can use a mild all-purpose cleaner. Pay attention to the folds and crevices. This manual cleaning removes visible mold and gunk. The Tub Clean cycle will then keep these areas cleaner for longer. For more specific guidance, you can read about [how to clean LG washing machine front load tub](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washing-machine-front-load-tub).

### Adding a Cleaning Agent (Optional, but Recommended)

You can run the Tub Clean cycle with or without a cleaning agent. For best results, I highly recommend using one. Common options include:
*   **White Vinegar:** Add 2 cups of distilled white vinegar directly into the detergent dispenser or the tub. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant and helps break down mineral deposits.
*   **Liquid Chlorine Bleach:** Add 1/2 to 1 cup of liquid chlorine bleach to the bleach dispenser. Bleach is a powerful disinfectant. It kills mold and mildew. Do not mix bleach and vinegar; they create harmful fumes.
*   **Washing Machine Cleaner Tablets/Powder:** Many brands offer specific cleaning products for washing machines. Follow the product instructions for placement. These are often placed directly in the drum.

Choose only one type of cleaning agent. Using a cleaner boosts the effectiveness of the Tub Clean cycle. It helps dissolve tough residue and kill bacteria. Always check your LG owner's manual for specific recommendations. Some models might suggest certain cleaners.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Activating Tub Clean on LG Washers

Activating the Tub Clean cycle on your LG washing machine is a straightforward process. The exact steps can vary slightly depending on your model. However, the core idea remains the same. I will walk you through the general procedure. This guide applies to most LG front-load and top-load washers.

First, ensure your washer is empty. We covered this in the preparation section. Double-check that no clothes or items are left inside. This is crucial for the cycle's effectiveness. Once the drum is empty, you can move to the control panel.

### Locating the Tub Clean Button or Setting

Look for a specific button or setting labeled "Tub Clean." On many LG models, this button is clearly marked. It might be on the main control knob or as a separate touch button. Some older models might have it under a different name. You might see "Clean Washer," "Sanitize," "Cleaner," or "Drum Clean."

If you cannot find a dedicated button, check the cycle options. Sometimes, Tub Clean is a selectable cycle. You turn the main dial to find it. Refer to your owner's manual if you are unsure. The manual will show the exact location for your model. I find that most newer LG washers make this option very easy to locate.

### Running the Tub Clean Cycle

Once you find the "Tub Clean" option, select it.
1.  **Select the Cycle:** Turn the dial or press the button to choose "Tub Clean." The display will usually show "Tub Clean" or "tCL."
2.  **Add Cleaner (Optional):** If you are using a cleaning agent, add it now. Place liquid bleach in the bleach dispenser. Put white vinegar in the liquid detergent dispenser. Drop a washing machine cleaner tablet directly into the empty drum.
3.  **Press Start:** Press the "Start/Pause" button to begin the cycle. The machine will fill with water. It will then agitate and spin at high speeds. This process usually takes about 1 to 2 hours. The duration depends on the model.

During the cycle, the washer door might lock. This is normal. Do not try to open the door. The machine is cleaning itself. It uses hot water and strong agitation. Once the cycle finishes, the door will unlock. Your washing machine is now cleaner.

### After the Cycle Finishes

When the Tub Clean cycle completes, wipe down the inside of the drum. Use a clean, soft cloth. Pay special attention to the door seal. Wipe away any remaining residue. Leave the washer door ajar for a few hours. This allows the drum to air dry completely. Air drying prevents new mold or mildew from growing.

Regular maintenance helps keep your LG washing machine in top condition. Running Tub Clean consistently makes a big difference. It ensures your laundry comes out fresh and clean every time.

## Specific Instructions for Different LG Washer Models

LG offers a range of washing machine models. This includes front-load and top-load designs. They also have different control panel layouts. While the core "Tub Clean" function is similar, the activation method can vary. I will provide specific tips for common LG washer types. This helps ensure you can find and run the cycle on your machine.

Understanding your specific model helps you use it best. Always check your owner's manual first. It has the most accurate information for your appliance. However, these general guidelines cover most scenarios.

### Activating Tub Clean on LG Front-Load Washers

LG front-load washers are very popular. They often have a dedicated "Tub Clean" button.
*   **Modern Models:** Look for a button labeled "Tub Clean" or "Cleaner" directly on the touch panel. Press it once to select. Then press "Start." The cycle usually takes over an hour.
*   **Older Models:** Some older front-load LG washers might require a button combination. You might need to press and hold "Rinse+Spin" or "Pre-Wash" for 3-5 seconds. The display will show "tCL" or "Tub Clean." Release the buttons and press "Start."
*   **HE Models:** If you have an LG HE (High-Efficiency) washing machine, the steps are largely the same. These machines are designed to use less water. The Tub Clean cycle on an HE machine will still use enough water to clean thoroughly. More details can be found on [how to clean LG HE washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-he-washing-machine).

Remember to wipe the rubber gasket thoroughly after the cycle. This area collects a lot of moisture and debris. Leaving the door open helps it dry out. This prevents mold growth.

### Activating Tub Clean on LG Top-Load Washers

LG top-load washing machines also feature the Tub Clean cycle. The process is slightly different from front-loaders.
*   **Dedicated Button:** Many top-load models have a "Tub Clean" button on the control panel. Select this option. Add your cleaning agent (if any) directly into the tub. Then press "Start."
*   **Cycle Selector Knob:** On some top-load models, "Tub Clean" might be one of the cycles you select using the main knob. Turn the knob to "Tub Clean" or "Cleaner." Then press the "Start" button.
*   **No Dedicated Button:** If there is no specific button, look for a "Deep Clean" or "Sanitize" cycle. These cycles often perform a similar function. If unsure, consult your manual.

Top-load washers do not have a rubber gasket around the door opening. However, you should still wipe the top rim of the drum. This area can accumulate residue. Leaving the lid open for a while after the cycle is a good practice for top-load machines too.

### What if My LG Washer Does Not Have a Tub Clean Setting?

It is rare for a modern LG washer not to have some form of tub cleaning cycle. However, if your model is very old or a basic type, it might lack this specific feature.
*   **Manual Cleaning:** You can still perform a deep clean manually. Fill the empty drum with the hottest water setting. Add 2 cups of white vinegar or 1 cup of bleach. Let it agitate for a minute. Then pause the cycle. Let the water sit in the drum for at least 30 minutes, or even an hour. Then resume the cycle to complete.
*   **Run a Hot Cycle with Cleaner:** Regularly run an empty hot water cycle. Add a washing machine cleaner or vinegar/bleach directly to the tub. This helps flush out buildup.

Even without a dedicated button, regular cleaning is vital. These manual methods provide good results. They keep your machine in better shape. Knowing how to maintain your appliance, even older ones, is part of being a smart homeowner.

## Choosing the Right Cleaning Agent for Your Tub Clean Cycle

Selecting the right cleaning agent for your LG washing machine's Tub Clean cycle is important. The agent you choose affects the cleaning power. It also affects the safety of your machine. There are a few popular options. Each has its pros and cons. I will explain them here.

Always read your LG washing machine manual first. Some manufacturers recommend specific types of cleaners. They might also warn against certain chemicals. Following these guidelines helps protect your warranty and your machine.

### Using White Vinegar for a Natural Clean

White distilled vinegar is a fantastic natural cleaner. It is mildly acidic. This property helps break down mineral deposits and soap scum. It also acts as a natural disinfectant. Many people prefer vinegar because it is non-toxic. It is also safe for most septic systems.

To use white vinegar:
*   Add 2 cups (about 500 ml) of white distilled vinegar.
*   Pour it into the liquid detergent dispenser. If your machine has no dispenser, pour it directly into the empty drum.
*   Select and run the "Tub Clean" cycle.

Vinegar is excellent for routine maintenance. It helps keep odors away. It is gentle on machine parts. It is a good choice if you prefer a chemical-free approach. For general cleaning with vinegar, you can also refer to [how to clean LG washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washing-machine-with-vinegar).

### Using Liquid Chlorine Bleach for Disinfection

Liquid chlorine bleach is a powerful disinfectant. It kills mold, mildew, and bacteria effectively. It is very good for tackling strong odors. Bleach provides a thorough sanitizing action. However, it is a strong chemical. You must use it carefully.

To use liquid chlorine bleach:
*   Add 1/2 to 1 cup (120-240 ml) of liquid chlorine bleach.
*   Pour it into the bleach dispenser. If your machine does not have one, add it directly to the empty drum.
*   Select and run the "Tub Clean" cycle.

**Important Warning:** Never mix bleach with vinegar or any other cleaning product. Mixing them can create dangerous, toxic fumes. Only use one type of cleaning agent per cycle. Bleach can be harsh on colors. So, always ensure the washer is completely empty.

### Using Commercial Washing Machine Cleaners

Many companies make specific washing machine cleaning products. These come in tablet, powder, or liquid form. Brands like Affresh, Washer Magic, or Tide Washing Machine Cleaner are common. These products are designed to target buildup. They often contain chemicals to dissolve grime and neutralize odors.

To use a commercial cleaner:
*   Follow the product's specific instructions.
*   Many tablets are placed directly into the empty drum.
*   Powder or liquid cleaners might go in the detergent dispenser.
*   Select and run the "Tub Clean" cycle.

Commercial cleaners are convenient. They are formulated for washing machines. They are often very effective. If your washer has severe odors or buildup, a commercial cleaner might be the best option. I find they often provide a deep clean. Always follow safety instructions on the product packaging.

## Optimizing Your Tub Clean Cycle for Best Results

Running the Tub Clean cycle regularly is key. But there are ways to make it even more effective. Optimizing your cleaning routine ensures your LG washing machine stays in top condition. It also helps your clothes remain truly fresh. I will share some important tips here.

These tips go beyond just pressing the button. They involve consistency and good habits. Incorporating them into your routine can prevent common washer problems. It can extend the life of your appliance.

### How Often Should You Run Tub Clean?

LG generally recommends running the Tub Clean cycle every 30 wash cycles. Or, run it at least once a month. This frequency prevents buildup from becoming severe. If you wash often, or if you live in an area with hard water, you might need to run it more frequently.

If you start noticing odors between cycles, increase the frequency. For example, try every two weeks. Consistency is more important than waiting for problems to appear. Preventative maintenance is always better than reactive cleaning.

### Additional Cleaning and Maintenance Tips

The Tub Clean cycle cleans the inner drum. But other parts of your washing machine also need attention.
*   **Wipe Down the Door Seal (Gasket):** On front-load washers, wipe the rubber gasket after every few loads. Use a damp cloth to remove moisture and lint. Pull back the folds to clean thoroughly. This prevents mold and mildew from settling.
*   **Clean the Detergent Dispenser:** Regularly remove and clean the detergent dispenser drawer. Residue can accumulate here. A small brush can help reach tight spots.
*   **Check the Drain Pump Filter:** Many front-load LG washers have a drain pump filter. This filter traps small items and lint. It can get clogged. Check your manual for its location. Clean it every few months. A clogged filter can cause odors or drainage issues. This is a very common place for unpleasant smells to start.
*   **Leave the Door Ajar:** After every wash cycle, leave the washer door slightly open. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps dry out moisture. This simple habit prevents mold and musty odors from forming.
*   **Use HE Detergent Correctly:** If you have an HE washer, always use high-efficiency (HE) detergent. Use the correct amount. Too much detergent creates excessive suds. These suds can leave residue. Residue leads to odors and buildup.

### The Importance of Proper Detergent Use

Using the right detergent and the correct amount is crucial. High-efficiency (HE) washers require HE detergent. HE detergents produce fewer suds. Regular detergent can create too many suds in an HE washer. These excess suds are harder to rinse away. They leave behind a film that attracts mold.

Always measure your detergent. Do not just pour it in. More detergent does not mean cleaner clothes. It often means more residue. If you have soft water, you might need even less detergent than recommended. Adjust based on your water hardness and load size. Proper detergent use helps your Tub Clean cycle work more effectively. It reduces the amount of residue needing removal.

## Troubleshooting Common Tub Clean Issues

Even with careful planning, sometimes things do not go as expected. You might encounter issues when trying to activate or complete the Tub Clean cycle on your LG washing machine. I will cover some common problems and their solutions here. This helps you get your machine back on track.

Knowing how to troubleshoot saves time and frustration. Most problems have simple fixes. Always refer to your LG owner's manual for model-specific advice. It is your best resource.

### Tub Clean Cycle Not Starting

You press the button, but nothing happens. Or the cycle does not begin.
*   **Check the Door:** Is the washer door fully closed and latched? Most washing machines will not start any cycle if the door is open. Front-load washers have a strong lock mechanism. Make sure it clicks shut.
*   **Power Supply:** Is the washer plugged in? Is there power to the outlet? Check the circuit breaker if needed.
*   **Child Lock:** Some LG models have a child lock feature. If activated, it prevents buttons from working. Look for a "Child Lock" indicator light. Hold down the corresponding button (often "Temp" or "Control Lock") for a few seconds to deactivate it.
*   **Pause/Cancel:** If the machine is paused from a previous cycle, press "Start/Pause" to clear it. Or press "Power" to turn it off and on again.
*   **Reset the Washer:** Sometimes, a simple reset can fix glitches. Unplug the washer for 5-10 minutes. Then plug it back in. This can clear internal errors. You can find more information on [how to reset your LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-your-lg-washing-machine).

If none of these work, there might be an internal error. The display might show an error code. Look up the code in your manual or LG's support website.

### Odors Persist After Tub Clean

You ran the cycle, but a musty smell remains. This is frustrating, but it happens.
*   **Gasket/Door Seal:** The most common culprit is residue in the door seal. Even after Tub Clean, you need to manually wipe it. Pull back the folds of the rubber gasket. Clean thoroughly with a cloth and a mild cleaner (like a vinegar-water solution).
*   **Detergent Dispenser:** Residue in the dispenser can also hold odors. Remove it and clean all parts thoroughly with a brush and warm, soapy water.
*   **Drain Pump Filter:** This filter collects lint, hair, and small items. These can rot and smell bad. Check your manual for the location of the drain pump filter (usually a small access door at the bottom front). Clean it out. Be ready with a shallow pan and towel, as water may come out.
*   **Frequency:** Are you running Tub Clean often enough? If odors return quickly, increase the frequency. Try running it every 2-3 weeks.
*   **Cleaning Agent:** Consider using a stronger cleaning agent. If you used vinegar, try a commercial washing machine cleaner or bleach (remember not to mix them).
*   **Hard Water:** If you have very hard water, mineral buildup can contribute to odors. Regular use of vinegar can help. You might also consider a water softener for your home.

### Washing Machine Not Draining After Tub Clean

If water remains in the tub after the cycle:
*   **Drain Pump Filter:** A clogged drain pump filter is the most common reason for drainage issues. Clean it thoroughly as described above.
*   **Drain Hose:** Check the drain hose. Ensure it is not kinked or blocked. Make sure it is installed correctly into the standpipe or sink.
*   **Error Code:** Look for an error code on the display. Codes like "OE" (Outlet Error) indicate a drainage problem.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, it might be a problem with the drain pump itself. In this case, professional service might be needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions About LG Tub Clean

### How often should I run the Tub Clean cycle on my LG washer?
LG recommends running the Tub Clean cycle every 30 wash cycles. Or, run it at least once a month. This regular cleaning helps prevent the buildup of mold, mildew, and detergent residue. If you wash frequently or notice odors, you might need to run it more often. Consistency keeps your machine fresh.

### Can I put clothes in the washing machine during the Tub Clean cycle?
No, you should never put clothes or any other items in the washing machine during the Tub Clean cycle. This cycle is specifically designed to clean the empty drum itself. Adding clothes can interfere with the cleaning process. It can also damage your garments or the machine.

### What if my LG washer does not have a specific "Tub Clean" button?
If your LG washer lacks a dedicated "Tub Clean" button, look for other labels. These might include "Cleaner," "Sanitize," "Drum Clean," or "Clean Washer."
