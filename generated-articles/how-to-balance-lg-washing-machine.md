## Stop The Shake: How To Balance Your LG Washing Machine

Ever feel like your laundry room turns into a rock concert during the spin cycle? That loud thumping and violent shaking usually mean your LG washing machine is off balance. An unbalanced washer makes noise. It moves across the floor. This condition puts stress on internal parts. It can shorten the appliance's life. I know this problem can be frustrating. You want your machine to work right.

This guide will show you how to balance an LG washing machine. We will cover common causes of unbalance. We will explain how to check your machine's level. You will learn to adjust the leveling feet. We also discuss how to handle uneven loads. We will talk about checking the floor. We will look at suspension components too. This information helps you solve the problem. You can make your LG washer run smoothly again.

### Takeaway

Balancing your LG washing machine prevents noise and extends its life. You can fix most unbalance issues yourself.
*   **Check the Load:** Distribute clothes evenly inside the drum. Do not overload or underload.
*   **Adjust Leveling Feet:** Use a level tool. Turn the feet to raise or lower each corner. Make sure all four feet touch the floor firmly.
*   **Inspect the Floor:** Ensure the floor surface is flat and strong.
*   **Review Internal Parts:** Check the shock absorbers or suspension rods if the problem persists.

To balance an LG washing machine, first ensure the load inside is evenly distributed and not too large or small. Then, use a level on top of the machine. Adjust the leveling feet at each corner by turning them clockwise or counterclockwise until the machine is perfectly level and stable on all four feet.

## Understanding Why Your LG Washer Is Unbalanced

An LG washing machine can become unbalanced for several reasons. Recognizing the cause helps you fix the issue quickly. Often, the problem is simple. It does not require a service call. Let us look at the common reasons. You can find out why your machine shakes.

### Uneven Laundry Loads

This is the most common reason for an unbalanced washer. Imagine a heavy wet towel stuck on one side of the drum. As the machine spins, this weight creates an imbalance. The drum tries to spin fast. The heavy side pulls it off center. This causes shaking and loud noises. Large items like blankets can also cause this. Small loads can clump together. This also leads to uneven weight distribution.

You can prevent this. Load clothes loosely. Mix large items with small ones. This helps distribute weight. Do not overload the machine. Leave space for clothes to move. Overloading prevents items from shifting correctly. This makes balancing harder. Sometimes, adding a few more items to a very small load helps. It gives the drum more material to distribute.

### Improper Installation or Uneven Floor

A washing machine needs a flat, stable surface. If your laundry room floor is uneven, the machine will wobble. This happens even if the machine itself is level. The legs cannot fully support it. Shims might be needed. Sometimes, the machine was not leveled properly during installation. The leveling feet might be set incorrectly. The machine might have moved over time.

New installations need careful leveling. Always use a spirit level tool. Check the front, back, and sides of the machine. Make sure it sits firmly. If the floor itself slopes, you have a bigger challenge. You might need to reinforce the floor. A strong, stable foundation is key. Without it, your LG washing machine will always struggle to stay balanced. This issue can also cause other problems, such as a [leaking LG washing machine from the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-lg-washing-machine-leaking-from-bottom).

### Worn or Damaged Components

Inside your LG washing machine, parts help keep it stable. These include shock absorbers and suspension rods. They dampen vibrations. They hold the tub centered. Over time, these parts wear out. They can become weak or broken. If a shock absorber fails, one side of the drum might drop. This leads to severe shaking. The problem gets worse during the spin cycle.

You might hear unusual grinding or scraping sounds. This suggests a component problem. Inspect these parts. Look for leaks around shock absorbers. Check for bent or broken rods. Replacing these parts usually requires some DIY skill. It is a more involved repair. If your LG washing machine keeps going off balance despite load and leveling checks, suspect internal parts. You can find more information about this particular issue here: [Why Does My LG Washing Machine Keep Going Off Balance](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-washing-machine-keep-going-off-balance).

### Debris Under The Machine

Sometimes, a small object gets under one of the leveling feet. This could be a coin, a piece of laundry, or even a pebble. This small item lifts one corner slightly. It makes the machine uneven. The machine then wobbles. This is an easy fix. You just need to check underneath.

Always check the floor directly under the machine. Clear away any objects. Ensure the feet have a clean, flat surface to rest on. This simple check can save you a lot of time. It prevents unnecessary adjustments. A clean base allows proper contact.

### Shipping Bolts Not Removed

For new LG washing machines, shipping bolts are a big cause of unbalance. These bolts secure the drum during transit. They prevent damage. If you do not remove them before using the machine, the drum cannot move freely. This causes extreme vibrations and loud noises. The machine will shake violently. This can damage the machine. It can also damage your floor.

Always check the installation manual for new machines. It will show you where the shipping bolts are. Remove them carefully. Store them in case you need to move the machine later. This step is critical. Do not skip it. An LG washing machine will not function correctly with shipping bolts still in place.

## Essential Tools For Leveling Your LG Washer

Before you start balancing your LG washing machine, gather the right tools. Having everything ready makes the job easier. It also ensures accuracy. You do not want to stop halfway through the process. Here are the essential items you will need.

### Spirit Level

A spirit level is crucial for this task. It helps you see if a surface is truly flat. You can buy one at any hardware store. A longer level works better. It covers more of the machine's surface. A 2-foot level is usually sufficient. Place it on top of your LG washing machine. Watch the bubble in the middle. The bubble must sit perfectly between the two lines. This tells you the surface is level.

Using a level ensures precision. It takes the guesswork out of the leveling process. Without a level, you might make the problem worse. Always check front-to-back and side-to-side. Some levels have a small circular bubble for checking surfaces in all directions at once.

### Adjustable Wrench or Pliers

LG washing machines have leveling feet. These feet have a locking nut and an adjustment foot. You need a tool to turn the locking nut. An adjustable wrench is perfect for this. Pliers can also work. The size of the wrench will vary. It depends on your specific LG model. Make sure the wrench fits snugly. This prevents slipping.

The locking nut secures the foot in place. It stops the foot from moving after you adjust it. You will loosen this nut first. Then you turn the foot. Finally, you tighten the nut again. This process locks the foot at the correct height. Always turn the nut clockwise to tighten. Turn it counter-clockwise to loosen.

### Flashlight

A flashlight helps you see under the machine. It is often dark and cramped there. You need to see the leveling feet clearly. You might also need to inspect the floor for debris. A bright flashlight reveals small objects. It shows you the condition of the feet.

Use the flashlight to guide your wrench. It helps you get a good grip on the nuts. Good visibility reduces frustration. It also helps prevent accidental damage. Never work in the dark. Safety is important.

### Shims (Optional)

Shims are thin pieces of material. They can be wood, plastic, or metal. You use them if your floor is very uneven. Shims go under the washing machine's feet. They raise a corner slightly. This helps if a leveling foot cannot extend far enough. They provide extra height.

Use shims as a last resort. Always try to adjust the leveling feet first. If the feet are fully extended and the machine is still not level, then use shims. Place them carefully under the foot. Make sure they are stable. Shims should not slip out. You can buy shims at hardware stores. They come in various thicknesses.

## Step-by-Step Guide To Leveling Your LG Washing Machine

Balancing your LG washing machine is a task most people can do. Follow these steps carefully. You will get your machine stable again. This guide breaks down the process. I will walk you through each part.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Washing Machine

Safety is first. Always disconnect power to your LG washing machine. Unplug the power cord from the wall outlet. This prevents accidental starts. It protects you from electric shock. Next, turn off the water supply. Close the hot and cold water valves behind the machine. This stops water from entering the machine. It also prevents leaks if you need to move the machine slightly.

Pull the machine away from the wall. You need space to work. Make sure you can reach the back and sides. You might need help if your machine is heavy. Do not strain your back. Place a towel or cardboard under the front feet. This makes it easier to slide. A clear workspace helps you work efficiently. Remove any items on top of the machine. Empty the drum of any laundry. An empty drum ensures accurate leveling. This is important for proper balance.

### Step 2: Check The Current Level

Place your spirit level on top of the LG washing machine. Check the level in a few spots. Place it on the front edge. Check the bubble. Then place it on a side edge. Check again. Finally, place it diagonally across the top. This gives you a full picture. Note which corners are high or low. The bubble will show you this. If the bubble is left of center, the right side is high. If it is right of center, the left side is high.

This step identifies the problem spots. You will know which feet need adjustment. Do not skip this check. It guides your next actions. A good check here saves time later. It ensures you adjust the correct feet. My own experience taught me that precise initial checks prevent rework.

### Step 3: Adjusting The Front Leveling Feet

Your LG washing machine has four leveling feet. The front two are usually easier to access. You will adjust these first. Tilt the machine slightly back to lift the front feet off the floor. Or, have someone help you lift it. This allows you to turn the feet freely. Look at the leveling foot. It has a threaded rod and a locking nut. The locking nut is usually above the foot.

Loosen the locking nut first. Turn it counter-clockwise with your wrench or pliers. Now you can turn the foot itself. Turn the foot clockwise to lower that corner. Turn it counter-clockwise to raise that corner. Make small adjustments. Lower the foot on the side that is too high. Raise the foot on the side that is too low. Once adjusted, gently lower the machine. Check the level again with your spirit level. Repeat this process until the front of the machine is level. When the front is level, tighten the locking nuts firmly. This locks the feet in place. Do not over-tighten them. Just make them snug.

### Step 4: Adjusting The Rear Leveling Feet (If Applicable)

Some LG washing machine models have self-leveling rear legs. These do not require manual adjustment. If your model has them, skip this step. If it does not, you must adjust the rear feet. This is similar to the front feet. However, accessing them can be harder. You might need to tilt the machine forward. Be careful. It is heavy. Have someone help you.

Loosen the locking nuts on the rear feet. Adjust them as needed to level the back of the machine. Use your spirit level often. Check both side-to-side and front-to-back. Make sure the entire machine is level. Tighten the locking nuts once adjustments are done. This ensures stability. Proper adjustment of all feet is crucial.

### Step 5: Rock The Machine To Check Stability

After leveling, test the machine's stability. Gently push down on each corner of your LG washing machine. Do this on the front, back, and sides. Does it rock or wobble? If it rocks, one or more feet are not firmly on the floor. Or, they are not bearing equal weight. If the machine rocks, you need more adjustments.

Find the rocking corner. Adjust the foot on that corner. Lower it slightly. This makes it bear more weight. Recheck all corners again. Keep adjusting until the machine sits perfectly still. It should not rock at all. This step is important. It ensures your machine is truly stable. A stable machine will not shake. This also helps with issues like those found in [how to balance a GE washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-balance-ge-washing-machine) or other brands, as the principle is similar.

### Step 6: Reconnect And Test

Once your LG washing machine is level and stable, reconnect everything. Plug the power cord back into the outlet. Open the water supply valves. Turn them fully counter-clockwise. Push the machine back into its spot. Make sure hoses are not kinked. They should not be pinched against the wall. A kinked hose can cause problems.

Run a small test load. Use a few towels. Select a spin-only cycle if possible. Watch the machine during the spin cycle. Does it still shake? Is it making noise? If it runs smoothly, you fixed the problem. If it still shakes, recheck your steps. You might need to adjust the feet slightly more. Or, consider internal issues. This final test confirms your work.

## Beyond Leveling: Other Factors Affecting Balance

Even after leveling your LG washing machine, problems can persist. The issue might not be the feet. Other factors influence a washer's balance. It is important to look at these possibilities. This helps you troubleshoot completely.

### Load Distribution and Size

As discussed, load issues are common. But let's look deeper. Are you washing a single heavy blanket? This creates a massive imbalance. The washer struggles to distribute that weight. Try washing two blankets instead of one. Or add some towels to balance the single blanket. Always mix items. Put small items with large ones. This fills the drum more evenly.

Do not overfill the washer. Clothes need space to tumble. If packed too tightly, they cannot redistribute. This leads to a lump of wet laundry on one side. Likewise, do not underfill. A very small load can also get stuck on one side. The minimal weight prevents even spreading. Aim for a load that fills the drum about three-quarters full. This gives clothes room to move. Proper loading is a key step to prevent unbalance.

### Floor Stability and Reinforcement

Your LG washing machine sits on the floor. If the floor is weak, it can flex or sag. This creates an unstable base. Wooden floors are more prone to this. Especially upper floors in older homes. The floor might not be strong enough for the machine's weight and vibration. Over time, constant shaking can loosen floorboards. This makes the problem worse.

You can check floor stability. Walk around the machine. Does the floor feel bouncy? Does it creak? If so, you might need to reinforce the floor. Add blocking between joists underneath. Use a thicker subfloor. This is a larger home improvement project. However, a stable floor is essential for a stable washing machine. Without it, you will fight unbalance issues constantly. Sometimes, a rubber anti-vibration mat helps on slightly uneven or less rigid floors. This mat absorbs some vibration. It provides a more stable grip.

### Inspecting Internal Suspension Components

If your LG washing machine is level, and you load it correctly, suspect internal parts. The suspension system holds the wash tub. It allows the tub to move freely. This system includes springs, rods, and shock absorbers. These parts absorb the force of the spinning tub. Over years of use, they wear out.

*   **Suspension Rods:** Look for bent or broken rods. Each rod has a spring on top. The spring helps absorb movement. If a spring is weak, that side of the tub will sag.
*   **Shock Absorbers:** These look like small car shocks. They slow down the tub's movement. If one leaks oil or feels loose, it is failing.
*   **Tub Bearings:** If you hear grinding or rumbling, the tub bearings might be worn. This is a more complex repair. It causes the tub to wobble.

Replacing these components usually requires opening the washer cabinet. It can be a DIY task. Many videos exist to guide you. However, it requires some technical skill. If you are not comfortable, call a professional. Proper functioning of these parts is vital for balance. This can be part of a broader [do it yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) project.

### Debris In The Drum Or Between Tubs

Sometimes, small items get caught. A sock might get between the inner and outer tubs. A bra wire could be stuck. This creates an internal imbalance. It can also cause grinding noises. Check the drum thoroughly. Look for anything that should not be there. Use a flashlight. Spin the inner tub by hand. Listen for scraping.

Removing debris can be tricky. You might need to remove the agitator or access panels. Follow your model's service manual. Sometimes, a clogged drain pump filter can also cause vibrations, as it struggles to remove water efficiently. While not directly a balance issue, inefficient draining can lead to heavier, water-logged loads. Keeping your machine clean, including cleaning the filter, is a good habit.

### Spin Speed Settings

Modern LG washing machines offer different spin speeds. Higher spin speeds remove more water. This saves drying time. However, higher speeds amplify unbalance issues. If your machine shakes violently at high spin, try a lower speed. This reduces the stress. It might also reduce the noise.

Consider if you always need the highest spin. For delicate items, a lower spin speed is better anyway. Adjusting this setting can be a temporary fix. It can also be a long-term solution. Especially if you cannot fully resolve a minor balance issue. A lower spin speed puts less strain on the machine. This extends its life.

## When To Call A Professional For Your LG Washer

You have tried everything. You leveled the machine. You checked the load. You looked at the floor. Still, your LG washing machine shakes violently. It makes loud noises. At this point, it is wise to consider calling a professional. Some problems are beyond a simple DIY fix. Knowing when to get help saves you time and prevents further damage.

### Persistent Unbalance After All Adjustments

You have followed every step in this guide. You adjusted the leveling feet multiple times. You checked the floor. You ensured correct loading. Yet, the machine continues to shake. This strong vibration often points to internal component failure. It might be worn shock absorbers. It could be broken suspension rods. It might even be damaged tub bearings.

These repairs often need specialized tools. They require experience. A professional can quickly diagnose the exact part that needs replacement. They have the right parts on hand. Attempting these complex repairs yourself without experience might cause more damage. It can also void your warranty. When troubleshooting fails, professional help is the best next step.

### Loud Grinding or Squealing Noises

Normal washing machines make some noise. A humming motor, water sloshing, clothes tumbling. These are fine. But grinding, squealing, or loud banging sounds are not normal. These noises often mean metal parts are rubbing. Or, bearings are failing. A failing bearing can cause the inner tub to wobble. This creates severe unbalance.

These sounds indicate serious mechanical issues. They suggest parts are on the verge of breaking. Continued use can lead to catastrophic failure. It can damage the motor or the tub. Call a technician immediately. They can identify the source of the noise. They can replace the worn part. Fixing it early prevents bigger, more expensive repairs.

### Leaking Water From The Machine

If your LG washing machine is leaking, stop using it. Leaks are a major concern. An unbalanced machine can stress hoses and seals. This leads to leaks. However, leaks can also be due to damaged parts. A cracked tub, a faulty pump, or loose hose connections cause water to escape. Water near an appliance is dangerous. It creates electrical hazards. It can also damage your floor or home.

A professional can find the leak source. They can repair it safely. Do not try to operate a leaking machine. Disconnect power and water. Wait for a technician. A leak combined with unbalance suggests a serious issue that needs expert attention. This is especially true if you notice water coming from the bottom of the machine.

### Error Codes Related To Unbalance

Modern LG washing machines have smart diagnostics. They often display error codes. These codes appear on the digital screen. Some codes specifically indicate an unbalance issue. Other codes might point to a spin cycle problem. Consult your LG washing machine manual for code meanings. If you frequently get an unbalance error (like "uE" or "Ub"), it is a clear sign.

While you can try to resolve the unbalance yourself first, persistent error codes mean something is wrong. The machine senses a fault. It might be trying to protect itself. A technician has diagnostic tools. They can read hidden error codes. They can test components. They provide a precise diagnosis. Do not ignore recurring error codes. They are your machine's way of asking for help.

## Preventative Maintenance To Keep Your LG Washer Balanced

Prevention is always better than cure. Performing regular maintenance on your LG washing machine can keep it balanced. This reduces wear and tear. It extends the life of your appliance. I follow these steps myself. They save money and frustration.

### Proper Loading Habits

This is the most impactful preventative step. Always load your LG washing machine correctly. Avoid washing only one very heavy item. For example, do not wash a single wet comforter alone. Add a few towels or smaller items. This distributes the weight. Mix large and small clothes. This prevents items from clumping.

Do not overload the machine. Leave space at the top of the drum. This allows clothes to tumble and redistribute. Overloading forces clothes into a tight ball. This causes major unbalance. Also, do not underload. A tiny load can get stuck on one side. This causes shaking. Aim for a load that fills the drum about 75%. This is the sweet spot for balance and cleaning.

### Regular Cleaning And Inspection

Dirt and debris can cause problems. A build-up of lint or gunk can weigh down one side of the drum. It can also interfere with the suspension system. Regularly clean your LG washing machine. Run a tub clean cycle. Use a washer cleaner or vinegar solution. This removes residue. It prevents blockages. You can find specific instructions on [how to clean an LG washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washing-machine-with-vinegar).

Inspect the interior. Check for foreign objects. Coins, buttons, or small toys can get caught. They can cause internal imbalance. Check the leveling feet. Make sure they are still tight. Ensure they are still firmly on the floor. A quick visual check before each wash can identify small issues early.

### Periodic Leveling Checks

Even if your LG washing machine seems stable, check its level regularly. Do this once every six months. Or, do it yearly. Over time, machines can settle. Floors can shift. The vibration from cycles can slightly loosen leveling feet. A quick check with a spirit level takes minutes.

If you notice a slight tilt, adjust the feet immediately. Do not wait for major shaking. Early correction prevents severe unbalance. It reduces stress on internal parts. This simple check is a cornerstone of preventative care. It keeps your machine running optimally.

### Avoid Washing Inappropriate Items

Some items are not meant for a washing machine. Or, they need special care. Heavy rubber-backed rugs can absorb a lot of water. They become extremely heavy. This creates an unmanageable load. Pet beds filled with foam can also become waterlogged. This leads to massive imbalance.

Always check care labels. Consider hand-washing very heavy, dense, or unusual items. Or, take them to a professional cleaner. Using your LG washing machine only for appropriate laundry prevents unbalance issues. It also protects your machine from damage. This extends its overall service life.

### Routine Professional Maintenance

Just like your car, your LG washing machine benefits from professional checks. Consider having a technician inspect your machine every few years. They can check internal components. They can look at shock absorbers. They can inspect suspension rods and tub bearings. These parts wear out over time.

A professional can spot wear before it becomes a major problem. They can replace worn parts. This prevents sudden failures. It ensures the machine stays balanced. This proactive approach saves you from costly emergency repairs later. It maximizes the life and performance of your LG washing machine.
