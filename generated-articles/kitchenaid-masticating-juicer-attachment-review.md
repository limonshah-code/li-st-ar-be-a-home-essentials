## Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer: A Detailed Review

Many of us love our Kitchenaid stand mixers. They handle everything from baking bread to whipping cream. Did you know your trusty mixer can also make fresh, delicious juice? The Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment transforms your stand mixer into a powerful slow juicer. I have put this attachment through its paces to see how it performs. We will explore its design, performance, and how easy it is to use and clean.

This comprehensive Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment review will guide you. It covers everything from assembly to the quality of juice it produces. I will share my personal experiences with various fruits and vegetables. You will learn if this attachment is a worthwhile addition to your kitchen. Let's dive in and see if this Kitchenaid accessory can meet your juicing needs.

### Takeaway

Here are the key points about the Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment:

*   It offers excellent juice yield, especially from leafy greens and hard produce.
*   The slow masticating process preserves more nutrients and reduces oxidation.
*   Assembly is straightforward, connecting easily to any Kitchenaid stand mixer.
*   Cleaning requires attention to several parts but is manageable with the included brush.
*   It is a good investment if you already own a Kitchenaid mixer and want quality juice.
*   The attachment saves counter space compared to a dedicated standalone juicer.

The Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment is an excellent choice for Kitchenaid owners seeking high-quality, nutrient-rich cold-pressed juices. It efficiently extracts juice, preserves nutrients, and offers good value by leveraging an existing appliance. Its performance with various produce types makes it a versatile kitchen tool.

## Why Choose a Masticating Juicer Attachment?

A masticating juicer works differently than a centrifugal juicer. It uses a slow-speed auger to crush and press fruits and vegetables. This method extracts juice gently. It minimizes heat buildup and oxidation. As a result, your juice retains more vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. This process makes healthier, more vibrant juice.

The Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment brings these benefits right to your stand mixer. You use your existing appliance motor to power the juicer. This saves you from buying another large kitchen device. It also saves precious counter space. For people who want fresh, high-quality juice without a dedicated machine, this attachment is a smart solution. This type of juicer is often called a "slow juicer" or "cold press juicer" for these reasons.

Choosing a masticating juicer attachment makes good sense for health-conscious people. It provides a way to get the most nutrients from your produce. The juice also tastes better and lasts longer in the refrigerator. This is a significant advantage over faster juicing methods. If you are still exploring the options, understanding [how to pick a masticating juicer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-pick-masticating-juicer) can help guide your decision. It ensures you choose the right juicer for your lifestyle and needs.

### Unboxing and First Impressions: Design and Build Quality

The Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment comes neatly packed. Inside the box, you will find the main auger, three pulp screens (fine, coarse, and sauce/jam), a food pusher, and a cleaning brush. Each part feels solid and well-made. Kitchenaid is known for its durable products. This attachment lives up to that reputation.

The design is sleek and matches the classic Kitchenaid aesthetic. The plastic components are BPA-free. They are thick and sturdy. The auger itself is robust. It looks capable of handling tough produce. I appreciate the clear plastic components. These allow you to see the juicing process. This transparency is not just for looks; it helps you monitor for clogs.

The entire unit attaches to the front power hub of your Kitchenaid stand mixer. The connection mechanism is secure. Once attached, it feels like a single, integrated appliance. The overall build quality inspires confidence. It suggests this attachment will last for many years of regular use. My first impression was very positive; this feels like a premium accessory.

## Assembly and Setup: Getting Started with Your Kitchenaid Juicer

Assembling the Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment is a straightforward process. First, you attach the main juicer body to your Kitchenaid stand mixer's power hub. A simple twist and lock mechanism secures it firmly. You then insert the auger into the juicer body. It slides in easily with a small click.

Next, you choose your desired pulp screen. The fine screen is for most fruits and vegetables, while the coarse screen works well for softer produce or if you prefer more pulp. The sauce/jam screen is for pureeing. You place the chosen screen over the auger, followed by the juicing basket. Finally, the cover locks onto the front. The food pusher completes the setup.

I found the instructions clear and easy to follow. Everything fits together intuitively. Even if you are new to juicing attachments, you will have it ready in minutes. This ease of assembly is a huge plus. It means less time fiddling with parts and more time making fresh juice. For general guidance on putting together juicers, you might find some universal principles in how to assemble specific models, like [how to put Champion juicer together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-champion-juicer-together). While the specific steps differ, the idea of slotting components into place remains similar.

### Performance Test: Juicing Fruits and Vegetables

The real test of any juicer is its performance. I tried the Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment with a variety of produce. I wanted to see how it handles different textures and densities. The results were consistently impressive. This attachment truly excels at extracting juice.

The slow speed of the auger works its magic. It crushes and presses ingredients thoroughly. You can see the dry pulp coming out. This indicates maximum juice extraction. The juice itself comes out smoothly. It has very little foam, which is a sign of good juice quality. I noticed the flavors were vibrant and fresh. This is exactly what you expect from a cold-press juicer.

This attachment proved its worth across all categories of produce. It is a reliable performer for daily juicing. The power from the Kitchenaid mixer motor handles the job easily. This is true even with the toughest vegetables.

#### Soft Fruits (Berries, Oranges, Grapes)

Juicing soft fruits with this Kitchenaid attachment is simple and effective. I started with oranges. I peeled them first, then cut them into manageable pieces. The juicer handled them beautifully. It produced a smooth, sweet orange juice with very little pulp. The pulp coming out was quite dry. This shows good extraction.

Berries and grapes also worked well. For grapes, I fed them in whole. The juicer extracted the juice efficiently. The resulting juice was rich in color and flavor. I recommend using the fine screen for most soft fruits. This gives you the clearest juice. However, if you prefer a bit more body, the coarse screen is an option. For a comparison on juice extraction efficiency with soft fruits, you could look at other dedicated juicers like the [Nutribullet Juicer Pro 1000W Juicer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/nutribullet-juicer-pro-1000w-juicer-review), which, while centrifugal, still gives a good idea of juice volume from similar produce.

One tip for very soft or overripe fruits is to alternate them with harder ingredients. This helps push everything through the auger effectively. The Kitchenaid attachment handles soft fruits with high yield and delicious results.

#### Hard Vegetables (Carrots, Beets, Celery)

Hard vegetables are often the true test of a masticating juicer. I put the Kitchenaid attachment to work with carrots, beets, and celery. I cut the carrots and beets into one-inch pieces. Celery stalks were cut into shorter segments. The attachment powered through them without hesitation.

The juice yield from these hard vegetables was excellent. The pulp that exited was noticeably dry. This means almost all the liquid was extracted. The carrot juice was bright orange and smooth. The beet juice was a deep red. Both tasted incredibly fresh and concentrated. Celery juice, known for its stringiness, was also handled well. The fibers were efficiently separated.

The powerful Kitchenaid motor is a big advantage here. It provides consistent torque. This prevents the auger from bogging down. I found no issues with stalling. This makes juicing large quantities of hard produce easy. Comparing its performance with other slow juicers, it holds its own very well. You can get an idea of the performance of other top-tier juicers like the [Omega Effortless Batch Juicer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/omega-effortless-batch-juicer-review) which is known for its robust handling of tough produce. The Kitchenaid attachment delivers solid performance with these demanding ingredients.

#### Leafy Greens (Spinach, Kale, Wheatgrass)

Leafy greens are notoriously difficult for many juicers. They can be fibrous and yield less juice. The Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment performs exceptionally well with them. I bundled spinach and kale leaves together before feeding them into the chute. The slow auger method squeezes every drop of liquid.

The yield from greens was surprisingly high. The pulp was almost bone dry, which is impressive for leafy produce. Wheatgrass, a popular but challenging ingredient, also juiced effectively. I found it best to feed greens in small batches. This prevents tangling around the auger. Alternating greens with a piece of apple or cucumber can also help push them through.

The resulting green juices were vibrant and rich. They had very little pulp, which is ideal for smooth green drinks. If you love green juices, this attachment will not disappoint. Its ability to handle fibrous greens is a major highlight. It maximizes nutrient extraction from these superfoods.

### Cleaning and Maintenance: Keeping Your Attachment Pristine

Cleaning any juicer can be a chore, but the Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment makes it as painless as possible. Disassembly is the reverse of assembly. It takes just a few seconds. All parts separate easily. This allows for thorough cleaning.

The attachment includes a specially designed cleaning brush. This brush is essential for clearing out pulp from the screens. I found that rinsing the parts immediately after juicing helps greatly. This prevents pulp from drying and sticking. For tougher pulp, a quick scrub with the brush and some warm soapy water does the job. Many parts are top-rack dishwasher safe. This adds convenience.

I recommend paying close attention to the fine screen. Small pulp fibers can get lodged in the tiny holes. The cleaning brush is perfect for this. While the cleaning process involves several pieces, it is not overly complicated. It typically takes me about 5-7 minutes to clean everything thoroughly. Regular cleaning ensures the juicer performs optimally and lasts a long time.

## Value for Money and Comparison to Standalone Juicers

Considering the cost of the Kitchenaid Masticating Juicer Attachment, its value depends heavily on whether you already own a Kitchenaid stand mixer. If you do, this attachment is a fantastic investment. It expands the functionality of an appliance you already have. This eliminates the need to buy and store a separate, bulky juicer. The cost of the attachment alone is significantly less than many high-quality standalone masticating juicers.

When comparing it to dedicated slow juicers, the Kitchenaid attachment holds its own in terms of performance. It produces excellent juice yield and quality, similar to models like the [Kuvings Juicer B1700](https://homeessentialsguide.com/kuvings-juicer-b1700-review) or the [Bosch Slow Juicer MESM731M](https://homeessentialsguide.com/bosch-slow-juicer-mesm731m-review). These standalone units often come with higher price tags. However, they may offer slightly larger feed chutes or specialized features. The Kitchenaid attachment's main advantage is its integration.

If you do not own a Kitchenaid mixer, the total cost of buying both the mixer and the attachment might exceed that of a good standalone juicer. In that scenario, it is worth comparing prices directly. However, for current Kitchenaid owners, this attachment offers unparalleled convenience and performance. It delivers premium slow juicing capabilities at a fraction of the cost of a dedicated machine. It truly enhances the utility of your stand mixer.
