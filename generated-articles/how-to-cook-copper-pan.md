The two main types of lining are tin and stainless steel. Each lining offers different cooking advantages. Understanding these differences helps you use your pan correctly. It also ensures safety and extends your pan's life. Choosing the right pan type ensures proper cooking.

### Tin-Lined Copper Pans

Tin is a traditional lining for copper cookware. It is soft and melts at lower temperatures. This means you should never use tin-lined pans over very high heat. High heat can cause the tin to bubble or melt, which exposes the copper. Exposed copper can react with acidic foods. Tin also scratches easily. Use wooden or silicone utensils with these pans. They are excellent for delicate cooking tasks. Many chefs believe tin-lined copper offers the best heat distribution. The tin surface naturally acts as a non-stick layer.

### Stainless Steel-Lined Copper Pans

Stainless steel is a durable and modern lining. It does not react with food acids. This makes stainless steel-lined pans more versatile. You can use them for a wider range of foods, including acidic sauces. Stainless steel can withstand higher temperatures than tin. This makes them suitable for searing or browning meats. These pans are generally easier to maintain. They do not require the same careful handling as tin-lined ones. While stainless steel does not conduct heat as well as tin, the overall copper body still provides excellent thermal control.
