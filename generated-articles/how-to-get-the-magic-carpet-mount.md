Talk to other players about prices. They might have insights into why prices are high or low. Sometimes, new patches or events can affect item values. Community knowledge is a powerful tool.

Do not rush into a purchase. If the price seems too high, wait. Another seller might list a cheaper one soon. Being patient can save you a lot of money. Remember, getting a good deal feels great.

### Safe Trading Practices

When buying items from other players, especially expensive ones like a magic carpet mount, safety is key. There are dishonest people in every game. You need to protect your in-game currency and your account. Always be vigilant during trades.

Use the official in-game trade window for direct trades. This system helps prevent common scams. It shows you exactly what items you are receiving and what you are giving. Double-check everything before confirming.

Never click on suspicious links or download unknown files. Scammers often try to trick you into giving away your account details. Reputable players will only use in-game tools for trades. Keep your personal information private.

Record your trades if possible. Some games have built-in logs. If not, taking screenshots can provide proof if something goes wrong. This evidence can help game support resolve issues. Safety makes the trading process smooth.
