Another popular configuration involves separate appliances. You can install a built-in electric oven into a cabinet at eye level. Then, you can place a gas hob into the countertop above a different cabinet. This setup offers more flexibility in kitchen design. It can improve ergonomics because you do not have to bend down to access the oven. This choice also allows you to select specific models from different brands. You might choose a high-end electric oven and a professional-grade gas hob separately. For a freestanding kitchen, you could have a separate electric oven and a separate gas hob unit if space permits. This is less common for modern built-in kitchens. However, it offers maximum flexibility in appliance placement. Consider your kitchen layout, space availability, and aesthetic preferences when choosing the best configuration for your home.
