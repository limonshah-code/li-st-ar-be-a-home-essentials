To fix a Miele dishwasher intake drain issue, you must first identify if the problem is with water intake, drainage, or both. Begin by checking and cleaning all filters and ensuring no kinks or clogs exist in the water supply and drain hoses. Test the drain pump and clear any air gap blockages to restore proper water flow.

### Understanding Miele Dishwasher Water Systems

Your Miele dishwasher relies on two crucial systems: water intake and drainage. The intake system brings fresh water into the wash tub. This system includes the water inlet valve and the intake hose. The drain system removes dirty water after cycles. This system involves filters, a drain hose, and the drain pump. Both systems must work perfectly for your dishwasher to operate.

A problem in one system can impact the other. For instance, if the dishwasher does not drain water, it cannot take in new water. If water cannot enter, the wash cycle cannot start. Understanding these connections helps in troubleshooting. Knowing which part handles which function makes diagnosis simpler. I find it very useful to think of them as two halves of a whole.

The Miele system is designed for efficiency. However, even the best systems can encounter issues. Dirt, food debris, and mineral buildup are common culprits. These can affect valves, hoses, and pumps. Regular maintenance can prevent many of these problems. We will explore each component in detail soon.

Consider the journey of water through your Miele machine. Fresh water enters, mixes with detergent, cleans dishes, and then drains away. Any interruption along this path causes problems. The dishwasher usually signals these problems with error codes. These codes help us pinpoint the exact issue.

We will focus on "Intake Drain 3" in particular. This error typically points to a failure in both processes. It may mean the machine struggles to take in water *and* to get rid of it. Or, it could indicate a specific sequence error where a drain problem impacts the intake phase. I want you to understand the full picture.

### Common Causes of Miele Intake and Drain Problems

Several issues can lead to your Miele dishwasher having intake or drain problems. One major cause is clogged filters. Food particles and grease can build up in the coarse filter, fine filter, and micro-filter. This blockage prevents water from draining properly. When the filters are clogged, water backs up in the tub.

Another frequent culprit is a kinked or blocked drain hose. The drain hose carries dirty water away from the dishwasher. If this hose is bent, crushed, or has a blockage, water cannot exit. Similarly, the water intake hose can also get kinked or blocked, preventing water from entering. I always check these hoses first. Inspecting them is a simple step. You can find more information about [how to replace Miele dishwasher drain hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-miele-dishwasher-drain-hose) if needed.

The air gap, if your installation includes one, can also cause issues. An air gap prevents dirty drain water from flowing back into your clean water supply. Food debris often gets stuck inside the air gap. This blockage can prevent proper drainage. Clearing the air gap is usually a quick fix.

The drain pump is another critical component. Its job is to force water out of the dishwasher. If the drain pump fails or is obstructed, water will not drain. Small broken glass pieces or food debris can jam the impeller. A faulty pump motor will also stop drainage. Sometimes, the pump simply needs a reset. If your dishwasher does not drain, you might want to learn [why won't my Miele dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-miele-dishwasher-drain).

Finally, problems with the water inlet valve can affect intake. This valve opens to let water into the dishwasher. If it is stuck closed, defective, or has low water pressure, no water will enter. This can lead to error codes related to water intake. Always ensure your home's water supply to the dishwasher is fully open.

### Troubleshooting Miele Dishwasher Error Codes

Miele dishwashers are smart machines. They often display error codes when something is wrong. These codes provide specific clues about the problem. For "Intake Drain 3," Miele usually points to issues with water supply or drainage. Common codes related to intake include "Water intake/drain," "Water intake," or a flashing inlet/drain symbol. This indicates the machine is not getting enough water or cannot get rid of it.

Your Miele manual is your best friend here. It lists all error codes and their meanings. Always consult it first. The manual also provides initial troubleshooting steps. For example, it might tell you to check the water tap. I always keep my manual handy for this reason.

Here are general steps to troubleshoot error codes:

*   **Turn Off and Unplug:** Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before doing any work. This protects you and the appliance.
*   **Check Water Supply:** Ensure the water tap connected to the dishwasher is fully open. Sometimes, it gets accidentally turned off.
*   **Inspect Hoses:** Look for kinks in both the water supply hose and the drain hose. Straighten any bends you find.
*   **Clean Filters:** A clogged filter is a very common cause of drain issues. Remove and clean all filters in the bottom of the tub. This simple step often solves the problem.
*   **Clear Air Gap:** If you have an air gap on your sink, check it for blockages. Debris can accumulate there.
*   **Reset Dishwasher:** Sometimes a soft reset clears a temporary glitch. Turn off the dishwasher, unplug it for a few minutes, then plug it back in and restart.

If the error persists after these basic checks, the problem might be more complex. It could involve internal components like the water inlet valve or the drain pump.

### Checking and Cleaning Miele Intake Filters and Valve

A clear intake path is vital for your Miele dishwasher. The first place to check is the water inlet hose filter. This small filter is usually located where the water intake hose connects to the dishwasher or the water supply valve. It prevents sediment from entering the machine. If this filter gets clogged, water flow will be restricted. This can trigger an "Intake" error.

To check this filter, you must first turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. Then, carefully disconnect the intake hose from the appliance or the wall valve. You should see a small mesh filter inside the connector. Use pliers or tweezers to pull it out gently. Rinse it under running water to remove any debris. If it is damaged, you might need to replace it. After cleaning, reinsert the filter and reattach the hose securely.

Next, consider the water inlet valve itself. This component controls water entry into the dishwasher. If it is faulty, it may not open fully or at all. This can cause the "Intake Drain 3" error if the machine is waiting for water that never comes. Testing the valve typically requires a multimeter to check for continuity and proper voltage. However, before testing, ensure there is adequate water pressure from your home's supply. A lack of water pressure can mimic a faulty valve.

A simpler step is to ensure that the water supply hose is not kinked or restricted. Sometimes, the issue is not the valve but the path to it. I always trace the hose from the wall to the dishwasher. Look for any sharp bends or items pressing against the hose. Fixing these often resolves the intake problem. For more on this, you can learn about [how to clean intake valves](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-intake-valves) effectively.

If after checking the filter and hose, the intake problem persists, the water inlet valve may need replacement. This is a more involved repair. It may require disconnecting the dishwasher and accessing the valve from underneath or behind. Always consult your Miele service manual before attempting such repairs. If you are unsure, calling a qualified technician is the best option.

### Inspecting and Clearing Miele Dishwasher Drain Hoses and Filters

Proper drainage is just as important as proper intake for your Miele dishwasher. When your machine struggles to drain, it can lead to standing water and a dirty wash. The first step to fixing this is to check the internal filters. Miele dishwashers typically have a coarse filter, a fine filter, and sometimes a micro-filter at the bottom of the wash tub. These trap food particles and debris. If they are clogged, water cannot drain out.

To clean these filters, open your dishwasher door. Locate the filter assembly in the center of the bottom rack area. Twist and lift out the main coarse filter. Separate the fine mesh filter from it. Rinse both thoroughly under running water. Use a soft brush to remove any stuck-on food or grease. Miele advises regular cleaning of these filters, often after every few washes. I make it a habit to clean mine weekly. This simple action prevents many drain issues. For more specific cleaning tips, you can read about [how to clean out dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-out-dishwasher-drain).

After cleaning the internal filters, inspect the drain hose. This hose connects from your dishwasher to your sink's drain pipe or garbage disposal. Look for any visible kinks, twists, or blockages along its path. If the hose is kinked, straighten it out. If it is blocked, you might need to disconnect it to clear the obstruction. Place a bucket underneath when disconnecting to catch any residual water. Use a thin brush or a long, flexible wire to push through any clogs.

Also, check the connection point at your sink or garbage disposal. Sometimes, food debris can accumulate there. If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, ensure the knockout plug was removed during installation. If the plug is still in place, water cannot drain. Run the disposal for 30 seconds to clear any debris before testing the dishwasher again. My experience shows that these small checks often fix the problem quickly.

Ensure the drain hose is properly elevated. The hose needs a high loop to prevent backflow of dirty water. This loop is usually secured under the countertop. Without it, water might drain too easily or even siphon back into the dishwasher. Checking this simple setup can solve mystery drain problems. This is a crucial step to ensuring your dishwasher drains correctly.

### Addressing Miele Drain Pump Issues

If you have cleaned the filters and checked the hoses, but your Miele dishwasher still will not drain, the drain pump might be the culprit. The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the dishwasher at the end of a cycle. When it malfunctions, water simply sits in the tub. You might hear a humming noise but no water movement, or no sound at all.

First, power off and unplug your dishwasher for safety. Accessing the drain pump often requires removing the lower kick plate or pulling the dishwasher out from its cabinet. Consult your Miele service manual for exact instructions on accessing the pump for your specific model. The drain pump is usually located underneath the dishwasher, near the front.

Once you access the pump, inspect it for obstructions. Small pieces of glass, plastic, or hard food particles can get past the filters and jam the pump's impeller. Use gloves and carefully remove any foreign objects you find. You may need to use pliers or tweezers to extract stubborn debris. I remember finding a broken piece of a fork that had completely stopped my drain pump. If you need to remove the pump, instructions on [how to remove Miele dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-miele-dishwasher-drain-pump) can be helpful.

After clearing any obstructions, try to manually spin the impeller (if visible) to ensure it moves freely. If it feels stiff or does not spin at all, the pump might be seized or the motor might be faulty. In this case, the pump will likely need replacement. Testing the pump with a multimeter can confirm if it is receiving power or if its internal motor winding is open.

A faulty drain pump can manifest as your Miele dishwasher saying "Drain" or other drainage-related errors. Before replacing the pump, always double-check the electrical connections to ensure they are secure. A loose wire can prevent the pump from operating. If you decide to replace the pump, make sure you get the correct Miele-specific part for your model. This ensures compatibility and proper function. If your Miele dishwasher still struggles to drain after these steps, it might be time to call a professional.

### Advanced Troubleshooting: Sensors, Pressure, and Control Boards

Sometimes, the "Intake Drain 3" error goes beyond simple clogs or mechanical failures. Your Miele dishwasher uses various sensors to monitor water levels, pressure, and flow. If these sensors malfunction, they can send incorrect signals to the control board. This can cause the dishwasher to stop filling or draining, even if the physical components are fine. For example, a faulty pressure sensor might tell the machine the tub is full when it is empty.

One critical sensor is the float switch. This switch detects when the water level in the tub reaches a certain height. If it gets stuck or becomes defective, it might incorrectly signal an overflow. This would prevent the dishwasher from taking in more water or trigger a drain cycle prematurely. You can usually find the float switch at the bottom of the tub. Ensure it moves freely and is not obstructed by debris. Gently lift and release it to see if it springs back.

Water pressure is also vital for the intake system. If your home's water pressure is too low, the dishwasher might not fill adequately. This can also trigger "Intake" errors. You can test your home's water pressure with a gauge. Ensure it meets Miele's recommended specifications. Sometimes, even partially closed shut-off valves for the dishwasher can reduce pressure. I always check that the main water valve to the house is fully open too.

The control board acts as the brain of your Miele dishwasher. It interprets sensor readings and controls all operations. A faulty control board can send incorrect commands to the intake valve or drain pump. This can lead to intermittent or consistent errors that are hard to diagnose. However, control board issues are less common than clogs or pump failures. They are also more expensive and complex to fix.

Diagnosing sensor or control board issues often requires specialized tools and expertise. If you have exhausted all other troubleshooting steps, and the "Intake Drain 3" error persists, it is wise to consider professional help. A technician can use diagnostic equipment to pinpoint exact sensor failures or control board malfunctions. Attempting to fix these without proper knowledge can cause more damage. It is good to know when to call in the experts.

### When to Call a Professional for Your Miele Dishwasher
