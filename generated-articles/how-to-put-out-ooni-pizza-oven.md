## Safely Shut Down Your Ooni Pizza Oven

After making delicious pizzas, knowing how to put out your Ooni pizza oven correctly is important. Proper shutdown ensures safety for you and your oven. It also helps maintain your Ooni for many years of use. This guide will walk you through the correct steps to safely extinguish and cool down any Ooni model, whether it uses gas, wood, or charcoal. We will cover specific instructions for each fuel type. We will also discuss essential cooling procedures and safe storage tips.

### Takeaway:

*   Turn off gas supply for propane Oonis.
*   Allow wood or charcoal to burn down completely in solid fuel Oonis.
*   Never use water to extinguish an Ooni oven.
*   Let your Ooni cool naturally before cleaning or moving it.
*   Always follow Ooni's specific safety instructions.

To put out an Ooni pizza oven, first turn off the gas supply for propane models. For wood or charcoal Oonis, stop adding fuel and let remaining fuel burn down naturally. Never use water to extinguish hot embers or flames. Always allow the oven to cool completely on its own before handling or storing.

## Understanding Your Ooni Fuel Type for Shutdown

Ooni pizza ovens come in different models. Each model uses a specific type of fuel. The way you put out your Ooni pizza oven depends on its fuel source. Knowing your oven's fuel is the first step in a safe shutdown. We need different methods for gas-powered ovens compared to solid fuel ovens.

Gas-powered Ooni ovens, like the Ooni Koda or Ooni Karu (when using gas burner), rely on propane. Propane allows for quick heating and cool-down. Shutting off the gas supply stops the heat immediately. This makes gas ovens simple to turn off. Always ensure the gas knob on the oven is turned off. Then, turn off the gas supply at the tank. This dual action prevents any gas leaks.

Solid fuel Ooni ovens use wood pellets, charcoal, or wood chunks. The Ooni Fyra uses wood pellets. The Ooni Karu models can use wood or charcoal. These ovens build up significant heat in their stone and body. The extinguishing process involves letting the fuel burn out naturally. It takes longer for these ovens to cool down completely. This natural burn-down is crucial. It avoids sudden temperature changes that can damage the oven's components. Understanding your specific Ooni model and its fuel is key to a safe shutdown process. For example, knowing [how to light Ooni pizza oven pellets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-light-ooni-pizza-oven-pellets) is helpful, but knowing how to extinguish them is just as vital.

Different Ooni models have unique features. Some Ooni ovens can reach incredibly high temperatures. Knowing [how hot does an Ooni pizza oven get](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-hot-does-an-ooni-pizza-oven-get) helps you appreciate the need for careful shutdown. Whether you use wood, charcoal, or gas, the ultimate goal is a safe and controlled cool-down. This prevents accidents and extends the life of your Ooni oven. Always consult your oven's manual for specific instructions.

## Putting Out a Gas-Powered Ooni Pizza Oven

Shutting down a gas-powered Ooni oven is straightforward. These ovens offer convenience because of their quick heat control. Safety is still important when handling propane. I always make sure to follow the correct sequence of steps to ensure a safe shutdown.

First, stop cooking your pizzas. Turn the temperature control knob on your Ooni oven to the "off" position. This immediately stops the flow of gas to the burner inside the oven. You will see the flames go out instantly. This is the primary way to stop the heating process. Give the oven a few moments. Ensure all flames are completely gone.

Next, go to your propane tank. Locate the valve on top of the tank. Turn this valve clockwise until it is fully closed. This action completely shuts off the propane supply. It disconnects the oven from its fuel source. Double-checking both the oven knob and the tank valve is a good practice. This prevents any accidental gas leaks. Once the gas supply is off, the oven will begin to cool down.

Do not disconnect the gas regulator immediately. Allow the oven to cool down for a significant period. The oven stone and body will still hold heat for a while. Disconnecting the gas line when the oven is hot is dangerous. It can cause burns. Wait until the oven is cool to the touch. This can take an hour or more, depending on [how long does it take Ooni pizza oven to heat up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-does-it-take-ooni-pizza-oven-to-heat-up) and how long it was running. Ensure the outside of the oven is no longer hot. For more details on connecting the gas, you can refer to [how to connect Ooni pizza oven to gas](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-connect-ooni-pizza-oven-to-gas).

## Extinguishing a Wood-Fired Ooni Pizza Oven

Extinguishing a wood-fired Ooni oven, including those that use charcoal or pellets, requires patience. Unlike gas ovens, you cannot instantly stop the heat. The process involves allowing the fuel to naturally burn down. This method ensures safety and prevents damage to the oven.

First, stop adding any new wood, charcoal, or pellets to the fuel tray or hopper. This is the most important step. No new fuel means the existing fuel will eventually run out. Let the remaining fuel in the oven burn completely. You will see the flames diminish. The wood will turn into embers, then into ash. This process can take a while, sometimes an hour or more. Do not be tempted to close the door or tamper with the fuel. Let it burn naturally.

Never use water to put out flames or hot embers in your Ooni. Pouring water into a very hot oven can cause significant damage. The sudden temperature drop can crack the sensitive pizza stone or other oven components. It also creates a lot of steam. This steam can cause severe burns. Water also mixes with ash to create a difficult mess to clean. It can even cause the ash to solidify. This makes future cleaning harder.

Allow the embers to cool down fully to ash. Once you see only cold ash, the burning process is complete. The oven will still retain a lot of residual heat. For ovens like the Ooni Karu, which can also use charcoal, the process is similar to using wood. If you are curious about using charcoal, you can learn more about [how to use Ooni pizza oven charcoal](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-ooni-pizza-oven-charcoal). This natural cool-down is important for the longevity of your oven.

## Post-Shutdown Cooling Procedures and Safety

After you have properly shut off the fuel source, the Ooni oven still needs to cool down. This cooling phase is critical for safety and the longevity of your oven. I always prioritize this step before any cleaning or storage. The oven retains significant heat, especially the pizza stone. This heat can cause burns if handled too soon.

Allow the Ooni oven to cool completely and naturally. Do not try to speed up the cooling process. Avoid hosing it down with water or placing ice on it. Rapid temperature changes can damage the oven's materials. The cordierite pizza stone is especially vulnerable to thermal shock. This can lead to cracks. A cracked stone means you cannot cook pizzas effectively. It may also need replacement. Patience is important during this stage.

The time it takes for your Ooni to cool varies. It depends on how long you used it and what temperature it reached. Gas ovens typically cool faster than wood-fired ovens. Wood-fired ovens can hold heat for several hours. You can tell the oven is cool when the exterior is no longer warm to the touch. You might wonder [how hot does the outside of an Ooni pizza oven get](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-hot-does-the-outside-of-an-ooni-pizza-oven-get) during operation; this gives you an idea of the heat it needs to dissipate.

Always wear heat-resistant gloves if you must handle the oven during the cooling process. This is good for any potential residual heat. Ensure children and pets are kept away from the oven during this time. The oven's base and legs might also be warm. Even the surface you placed your Ooni on can get hot. Consider if [does Ooni pizza oven get hot underneath](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-ooni-pizza-oven-get-hot-underneath) applies to your setup to ensure proper safety with your table or stand. Full cooling might take several hours. Some ovens might even take overnight to reach ambient temperature.

## Cleaning and Storing Your Ooni Oven After Use

Once your Ooni oven is completely cool, you can begin the cleaning process. Proper cleaning and storage after each use extend your oven's life. It also keeps it ready for your next pizza-making session. Never attempt to clean a hot or warm oven. I always make sure my oven is cool to the touch before doing anything.

Start by removing any loose ash from solid fuel ovens. Use a small brush or ash scoop for this. For gas ovens, you won't have ash, but you might have some carbon residue. Scrape off any burnt food bits from the pizza stone. A stiff wire brush or a special Ooni pizza oven brush works well. Do not use soap or water on the pizza stone. The stone is porous and will absorb water and soap. This can cause issues with flavor and heating in the future. Just dry brush the stone clean.

Wipe down the inside and outside of the oven body. Use a damp cloth to remove soot or grease. For stubborn stains, a mild, non-abrasive cleaner can be used on the stainless steel parts. Ensure the oven is completely dry before storing it. Moisture can lead to rust or other damage over time. This is especially true if you are storing it in a damp environment.

Consider covering your Ooni oven with a weather-resistant cover. This protects it from dust, rain, and other elements. Ooni offers specific covers for their ovens. If you plan to leave your oven outdoors, a cover is essential. You might wonder, [can you use Ooni pizza oven in the rain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-ooni-pizza-oven-in-the-rain)? While some models handle light rain, a cover is best for long-term protection. During colder months, if you live in a region with harsh winters, you should store your Ooni indoors. Moving your Ooni inside can prevent damage from extreme temperatures.

Operating an Ooni pizza oven provides great fun and delicious food. However, safety must always come first. Knowing how to put out your Ooni pizza oven correctly is a big part of safe operation. Beyond shutdown, several other safety tips ensure a worry-free experience. I always keep these in mind when I am using my Ooni.

Always place your Ooni oven on a stable, heat-resistant surface. Ooni ovens get very hot. The surface underneath and around the oven needs to withstand high temperatures. Never put your Ooni directly on flammable materials like wood decks without proper insulation. For guidance, check out [what can I put my Ooni pizza oven on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-can-i-put-my-ooni-pizza-oven-on). This prevents fire hazards. Ensure there is enough clearance around the oven. This means keeping it away from walls, fences, or other structures.

Never use your Ooni oven indoors or in enclosed spaces. All Ooni ovens, whether gas or solid fuel, produce carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a dangerous, odorless gas. It can be deadly in unventilated areas. Always operate your Ooni outdoors in an open space. Good airflow is essential for safety. Even a partially enclosed patio might not be safe enough.

Keep children and pets away from the Ooni oven during operation and cooling. The oven's exterior, exhaust, and stone reach extreme temperatures. Accidental contact can cause severe burns. Establish a safety zone around the oven. Supervise children closely when the oven is in use. Remind them not to touch the hot surfaces.

Have a fire extinguisher or a bucket of sand nearby. This is a good precaution for any outdoor cooking. While unlikely with proper use, a small grease fire or flare-up can occur. Never use water on a grease fire or a wood/charcoal fire inside the oven. A fire extinguisher rated for Class B (flammable liquids) or Class K (cooking oils) fires is best. Sand can also smother small fires. Being prepared helps handle unexpected situations quickly.

Finally, always read your specific Ooni model's manual. Each oven has unique instructions for setup, operation, and shutdown. The manual provides the most accurate safety guidelines for your particular oven. Following these guidelines ensures a safe and enjoyable pizza-making experience every time.
