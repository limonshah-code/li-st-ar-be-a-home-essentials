## Understanding Pre Wash in LG Washing Machines

Have you ever faced stubborn stains or extra dirty laundry? Sometimes, a regular wash cycle just does not cut it. This is where the pre wash in an LG washing machine becomes your laundry hero. It offers a powerful first step for truly soiled items.

Understanding this cycle can greatly improve your laundry results. The pre wash feature works to loosen dirt and prepare clothes for a deeper clean. In this article, we explore what pre wash means, when to use it, and how it works. We also cover its benefits and how to activate it on your LG washer. Get ready to transform your laundry routine.

### Takeaway

*   Pre wash removes heavy dirt and loose soil before the main wash cycle.
*   It involves a separate water fill, gentle agitation, and rinse.
*   Use pre wash for items like muddy clothes, work uniforms, or heavily stained garments.
*   This cycle boosts cleaning power, helps with stain removal, and prevents dirt redeposition.
*   Always add detergent to the specific pre wash dispenser for optimal results.

### What is Pre Wash in an LG Washing Machine?

The pre wash cycle in an LG washing machine is an initial, short wash and rinse phase. It removes loose dirt and heavy soil before the main wash cycle begins. This process ensures a more thorough cleaning for heavily soiled clothes, preparing them for optimal detergent action and better overall results.

## What is the Pre Wash Cycle?

The pre wash cycle acts as a crucial first step in your laundry routine. It is a preliminary wash phase that happens before the main wash. Think of it as a warm-up for your clothes. This cycle aims to loosen and remove a lot of the surface dirt.

Its main function is to handle excessive soil. When clothes are very dirty, they carry a lot of loose particles. A pre wash helps get rid of these before the main cleaning. This keeps the main wash water cleaner.

A regular wash jumps right into cleaning with detergent and agitation. The pre wash, however, is gentler and shorter. It uses water and often a small amount of detergent to simply dislodge the most obvious dirt. LG designs this feature to boost the overall cleaning power of your machine. It makes sure that your main wash works on deep-seated dirt, not just surface grime. This initial step is vital for achieving truly clean laundry, especially for items that have seen a lot of action. It prepares the fabric, allowing the main detergent to work better on tougher stains and deeper dirt.

Many people confuse pre wash with a pre-soak. While both involve an initial water contact, they are different. A pre-soak is often just soaking clothes in water, sometimes with detergent, for an extended period. The pre wash cycle is an active, shorter wash and rinse. It prepares the clothes more actively for the next stage. Knowing [what does pre-soak do on a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-does-pre-soak-do-on-a-washing-machine) can help you pick the right initial treatment for your laundry.

## When to Use Pre Wash in Your LG Washer

Deciding when to use the pre wash cycle is simple. You use it for items that are dirtier than average. If your clothes have visible mud, heavy grease, or large stains, pre wash is a smart choice. It handles the initial layer of grime.

Consider work clothes, like those worn by mechanics or construction workers. These garments often collect significant dirt throughout the day. Sports uniforms, covered in grass stains or sweat, also benefit greatly from this extra step. Any item with dried-on dirt, such as garden clothes, will clean better with a pre wash.

Baby clothes are another good example. They often have food spills, formula stains, or diaper accidents. A pre wash helps lift these before the main cycle. This protects the delicate fabrics. You should not use pre wash for lightly soiled items. It uses extra water and time, which is not necessary for clothes that just need a quick freshening.

If you are unsure, inspect your laundry closely. If you see thick dirt, caked-on mud, or a lot of loose debris, then pre wash is your answer. It is specifically for those moments when your laundry needs an extra boost. Using it wisely saves resources and helps you get the cleanest clothes possible. I find it really helpful after a weekend of outdoor activities. My children's clothes come out much cleaner when I use this feature for their muddy play clothes.

## How Pre Wash Works on an LG Washing Machine

The pre wash cycle in an LG washing machine follows a specific sequence. This ensures effective initial cleaning. First, the machine fills with a small amount of water. This water is usually cold, but some cycles might use warm water depending on the setting. The cold water helps to prevent setting protein-based stains, like blood or food.

Next, the machine adds a small amount of detergent. Many LG washers have a dedicated pre wash dispenser for this purpose. The machine then begins a gentle agitation phase. This agitation is not as vigorous as the main wash. Its goal is to loosen heavy dirt and soil from the fabric fibers.

After agitation, the machine drains the dirty water. It then performs a brief rinse. This step washes away the loosened dirt and any residual detergent from the pre wash. The clothes are now free from the heaviest soil. This prepares them for the main wash cycle.

The main wash cycle follows immediately after the pre wash finishes. With the heaviest dirt removed, the main wash detergent can work more effectively. It targets deeper stains and overall fabric cleaning. This two-stage process means your clothes get a more thorough cleaning overall. The pre wash truly helps to break down that initial layer of grime, setting the stage for sparkling clean laundry.

## Benefits of Using the Pre Wash Setting

Using the pre wash setting on your LG washing machine offers many benefits. It significantly improves the cleaning performance for heavily soiled items. This cycle removes a large amount of dirt and grime. This means the main wash can focus on deeper cleaning.

One major advantage is preventing redeposition. Heavily soiled clothes can release dirt into the wash water. In a single wash cycle, this dirt might settle back onto other clothes, making them look dull. Pre wash removes this initial dirt, keeping the main wash water cleaner. This helps all your garments come out brighter and fresher.

Pre wash also leads to better stain removal. By tackling surface dirt first, the main detergent can work directly on stubborn stains. It does not get "distracted" by overall soil. This can be key for things like grass stains or food spills. It truly boosts the power of your laundry detergent.

Using pre wash can also extend the life of your clothes. Loose, abrasive dirt can wear down fabric fibers during agitation. Removing this dirt early reduces wear and tear. This helps your favorite garments last longer. It is a simple step that makes a real difference. Maximizing the efficiency of your main wash cycle means you get cleaner clothes with less effort. This results in an overall feeling of freshness in your laundry.

## Activating Pre Wash on LG Washing Machines

Activating the pre wash feature on your LG washing machine is usually simple. The exact steps might vary slightly between models, but the general process is consistent. First, load your clothes into the washer. Make sure not to overload the machine. Overloading can reduce cleaning effectiveness.

Next, you add your detergent. Most LG washers have a dedicated dispenser for pre wash detergent. You will add the main wash detergent to its own compartment. It is important to put the correct amount in each dispenser. Using too much detergent in the pre wash can create too many suds. This is not ideal.

Then, you select your desired main wash cycle. This could be "Normal," "Heavy Duty," or another option. After selecting the main cycle, look for a "Pre Wash" button or option on the control panel. This might be a physical button or a touch-sensitive icon. You simply press or select it to activate the pre wash cycle. The machine's display often shows that the pre wash option is active.

Finally, you start the cycle. The machine will begin with the pre wash phase, then move to the main wash automatically. If you are unsure about your specific model, always check your LG washing machine's user manual. It provides exact instructions for your particular washer. Some newer LG models might even allow you to select pre wash through a smart app. This gives you remote control over your laundry. Always refer to your product documentation for the most accurate guidance.

## Detergent and Additives for the Pre Wash Cycle

Choosing the right detergent and additives for your LG washing machine's pre wash cycle is important. You typically use a small amount of liquid laundry detergent for the pre wash. Liquid detergents dissolve easily in cooler water, which is often used during this initial phase. Powder detergents can sometimes clump if the water is too cold or if not enough water is used.

Most LG washing machines have a specific compartment in the dispenser drawer for pre wash detergent. It is important to add the detergent here, not in the main wash compartment. Adding too much detergent is a common mistake. This can cause excess suds. Too many suds can hinder the cleaning process and even leave residue on clothes. Read your detergent instructions for recommended amounts for a small load or pre wash.

You generally do not use fabric softener during the pre wash. Fabric softener is for the final rinse cycle. It works to soften clothes and reduce static. Adding it during pre wash would wash it away before it could do its job. For specific spot stains, you might want to use a pre-treatment spray. Apply this directly to the stain *before* loading the clothes into the washer. This targets the stain even before the pre wash begins.

Remember, the pre wash is different from other cycles, like a [quick wash](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-lg-washing-machine-have-quick-wash). A quick wash is designed for lightly soiled items that need a fast clean. Pre wash, however, is for heavily soiled items needing an initial dirt removal. Each cycle has its purpose, and understanding them helps you get the best results for your clothes. Using the correct products in the right way ensures your pre wash is as effective as possible.

## Maintaining Your LG Washer with Pre Wash Use

Regular use of the pre wash cycle helps get clothes cleaner. However, it also means your LG washing machine handles more dirt. This increased dirt load makes machine maintenance even more important. A well-maintained washer works better and lasts longer.

One key area to focus on is the detergent dispenser. Dirt, detergent residue, and even mold can build up here. Clean the pre wash dispenser compartment regularly. Pull out the drawer if your model allows. Wash it with warm, soapy water. Use a small brush to get into tight spots. This prevents blockages and bad odors.

LG washing machines often have a "Tub Clean" or "Self Clean" cycle. Run this cycle regularly, perhaps once a month or every few weeks. This cycle uses hot water and strong agitation to clean the inside of the drum. It removes soap scum, mold, and odor-causing bacteria. This is especially important for [how to clean an LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-an-lg-washing-machine), keeping it fresh for every load.

Check the washer's filters, especially the drain pump filter. This filter traps small items and lint. Heavy soil from pre wash cycles can cause it to clog faster. Refer to your user manual for filter location and cleaning instructions. Cleaning this filter prevents draining issues and machine errors.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: Is pre wash always necessary for my laundry?

No, pre wash is not always necessary. It is for heavily soiled items, like muddy clothes or work uniforms. For everyday loads with light dirt, a standard wash cycle is enough. Using pre wash for every load wastes water and energy. Evaluate your laundry's dirt level before selecting this option.

### Q2: Can I use fabric softener in pre wash?

No, you should not use fabric softener in the pre wash cycle. Fabric softener is meant for the final rinse. Adding it during pre wash would cause it to be washed away before it can condition your clothes. Always add fabric softener to the specific dispenser for the final rinse.

### Q3: What if my LG washer does not have a pre wash option?

If your LG washer does not have a specific pre wash option, you can still achieve a similar effect. You can run a short, cold wash cycle with a small amount of detergent first. Then, select your main wash cycle. Alternatively, you can pre-soak clothes in a tub with water and detergent before loading them into the machine.

### Q4: Does pre wash use more water and energy?

Yes, pre wash uses more water and energy compared to a cycle without it. It involves an additional water fill, agitation, and drain cycle. This extra step consumes more resources. Use pre wash only when your clothes are truly heavily soiled to save water and energy.

### Q5: How long does the pre wash cycle last?

The duration of an LG washing machine's pre wash cycle varies by model and selected main cycle. Generally, it is a short cycle, lasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes. This time includes water fill, gentle agitation, and a brief drain and rinse. It does not add a significant amount of time to the overall wash.

### Q6: Can I use bleach during pre wash?

It is generally not recommended to use bleach in the pre wash cycle. Bleach is very powerful and can be harsh on fabrics. If you plan to use bleach, it is usually added during the main wash cycle, or in a specific bleach dispenser for a later stage. Refer to your bleach product instructions and your LG washer manual for proper use.
