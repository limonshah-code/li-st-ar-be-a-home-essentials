### What causes water not to drain from a dishwasher?

When your dishwasher does not drain, it often points to a clog in the filter, drain hose, air gap, or garbage disposal connection. A faulty drain pump or check valve can also prevent water from leaving the unit. Addressing these issues can restore proper drainage.

## Clogged Dishwasher Filter and Drain Screen

One of the most frequent reasons for a dishwasher not draining is a clogged filter or drain screen. During wash cycles, food particles, grease, and other debris wash off your dishes. These particles settle into the filter system at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Over time, this buildup can become so dense that it blocks water from passing through to the drain pump.

A blocked filter prevents the water from reaching the drain pump efficiently. This means the pump tries to push water out, but the heavy debris acts like a dam. The water then sits in the tub because it cannot pass through the blocked pathways. Regularly cleaning these components is a vital step in preventing drainage issues. I always recommend checking these first.

### How to Clean Your Dishwasher Filter

Cleaning your dishwasher filter is a simple task that can prevent many drainage problems. First, locate the filter assembly at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It usually consists of a cylindrical filter and a flat filter screen. You will need to remove the lower dish rack to access it easily.

Twist the cylindrical filter counter-clockwise and lift it out. Then, remove the flat filter screen underneath. Take both parts to your sink and rinse them under warm running water. Use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to gently scrub away any stubborn food particles or greasy residue. Make sure to clean all crevices thoroughly. Once clean, reassemble the filters in the reverse order. This simple maintenance step can make a big difference.

## Blocked Air Gap or High Drain Loop

Dishwashers rely on specific plumbing setups to drain correctly and safely. Two common components related to drainage are the air gap and the high drain loop. A blockage in either of these can easily cause your dishwasher to stop draining. It is important to check these components if you find standing water.

An air gap is a small, cylindrical fixture found on your kitchen countertop, usually near the sink. Its purpose is to prevent contaminated water from your sink or disposal from flowing back into the dishwasher. If food particles or mineral deposits clog this air gap, it creates a blockage. This blockage stops the wastewater from your dishwasher from passing through to the drain.

### Cleaning a Clogged Air Gap

Cleaning a clogged air gap is a straightforward process. First, remove the cap from the top of the air gap on your countertop. You might need to gently pry it off. Underneath, you will find an inner cap or cover. Remove this as well. Look inside the opening for any visible debris, such as food particles or greasy buildup.

Use a small brush, a pipe cleaner, or even a screwdriver to clear out any obstructions. Be careful not to push debris further into the plumbing. Once clear, run your garbage disposal and then your dishwasher briefly to flush any remaining loose debris. Reattach the caps, and your air gap should function correctly again.

### The Role of a High Drain Loop

If your dishwasher does not have an air gap, it likely uses a high drain loop. This means the drain hose rises high under the counter before connecting to the sink drain or garbage disposal. The high loop serves a similar purpose to the air gap. It prevents wastewater from backing up into the dishwasher from the sink. It also stops water from siphoning out of the dishwasher during a wash cycle.

If the drain hose drops below the connection point at any point, it can lose its high loop function. This can lead to inefficient draining or standing water. Ensure the drain hose maintains its high position, usually secured with a clamp or strap. The high drain loop is a simple yet effective passive drainage mechanism.

## Issues with the Dishwasher Drain Hose

The drain hose is a critical part of your dishwasher's drainage system. This flexible hose carries the dirty water from the dishwasher tub to your home's main drain line, usually through the garbage disposal or a dedicated sink drain. If this hose encounters a problem, water cannot exit the dishwasher. This often results in standing water after a cycle.

The drain hose can face a few common issues. It might become kinked or bent, especially if the dishwasher was moved during installation or if items stored under the sink press against it. A severe bend restricts water flow just like a blocked pipe. Over time, food debris, grease, and even hard water mineral deposits can accumulate inside the hose. This buildup narrows the hose's diameter, making it difficult for water to pass through.

### Inspecting for Kinks and Obstructions

To inspect your dishwasher drain hose, you will need to pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet recess slightly. This allows better access to the back of the unit. First, unplug the dishwasher from the power outlet for safety. Then, gently slide the dishwasher forward. Locate the drain hose, which is typically a corrugated plastic hose connected to the dishwasher's drain pump and then to the sink or garbage disposal.

Carefully examine the entire length of the hose for any visible kinks, twists, or sharp bends. If you find one, try to straighten it out. If the hose feels hard or inflexible in certain spots, it might indicate an internal clog. You can also disconnect the hose from the sink or disposal side and try to blow air through it. If air does not pass easily, there is likely an obstruction. You may need to remove the hose completely to clear a stubborn clog, often using a long brush or snake. Ensuring a clear and properly routed drain hose is essential for effective drainage. The drain hose is a direct path for water to leave, even for passive draining. The question of [Can a Dishwasher Drain Without Being On?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-dishwasher-drain-when-not-on) often depends on the hose's condition and routing.

## Garbage Disposal Connection Problems

Many modern dishwashers are plumbed to drain directly into the garbage disposal unit in your kitchen sink. This setup is convenient, but it also means the garbage disposal can be a source of drainage problems for your dishwasher. If the disposal itself is clogged, or if a specific installation step was missed, your dishwasher will not drain properly. It is a common oversight when troubleshooting.

A garbage disposal full of food waste can create a blockage. If you have not run your disposal recently, or if it is struggling to grind food, the drain path for your dishwasher might be obstructed. Additionally, if you recently installed a new garbage disposal, there is a crucial step often overlooked. New disposals come with a knockout plug in the dishwasher inlet port. This plug must be removed before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. If the plug remains in place, it completely blocks the dishwasher's drain path.

### Checking the Knockout Plug

First, ensure your garbage disposal is completely clear. Run it with plenty of cold water for a minute or two to clear any food debris. If your dishwasher still does not drain, and you recently installed a new garbage disposal, you need to check for the knockout plug. This plug is designed to be removed for dishwasher connections.

To check for the knockout plug, unplug the garbage disposal from its power source for safety. Disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the garbage disposal's inlet port. Look inside the disposal's inlet port. If you see a solid piece of plastic blocking the opening, this is the knockout plug. You can usually remove it by gently tapping it inward with a screwdriver and a hammer. Once it falls into the disposal, retrieve it and reconnect the drain hose. This simple fix solves a surprisingly common problem.

## Malfunctioning Dishwasher Drain Pump

If you have checked for clogs in the filter, air gap, drain hose, and garbage disposal and your dishwasher still has standing water, the problem might be more serious. A malfunctioning drain pump is a common cause of complete drainage failure. The drain pump is the motor-driven component responsible for forcibly expelling water from the dishwasher tub and sending it through the drain hose. If the pump fails, water has nowhere to go.

The drain pump can fail for several reasons. Sometimes, small pieces of debris, like broken glass, fruit seeds, or even a piece of silverware, can get past the filter and jam the pump's impeller. Over time, the motor itself can wear out, or electrical connections can become faulty. When the pump is not working, the dishwasher cannot complete its drain cycle. This leaves dirty water stagnant in the bottom of the unit.

### Signs of a Failing Drain Pump

Several signs can indicate a failing dishwasher drain pump. One common sign is an unusual noise during the drain cycle. You might hear a loud humming or grinding sound, which suggests the motor is trying to work but is either jammed or failing. Conversely, if you hear no sound at all during the drain portion of the cycle, it could mean the pump motor is completely dead or not receiving power. In a properly functioning dishwasher, you should hear the distinct sound of water being forcefully pumped out.

Another clear sign is the presence of standing water at the end of every cycle, even after you have cleared all potential clogs. If the water remains and the pump is silent or making strange noises, it strongly suggests a pump issue. Replacing a drain pump can be a complex task, often involving tilting or removing the dishwasher and accessing components from the underside. For most homeowners, this job often warrants calling a professional appliance repair technician. Attempting this repair yourself without proper knowledge can cause further damage or pose safety risks.

## Defective Check Valve or Sump Assembly

Beyond the drain pump, other internal components play a vital role in proper drainage. The check valve and the sump assembly are two such parts. A problem with either of these can prevent your dishwasher from fully draining or cause dirty water to flow back into the tub. Understanding their function helps pinpoint potential issues.

The check valve is a one-way valve located in the drain pump or the drain hose connection. Its purpose is to allow water to flow out of the dishwasher but prevent it from flowing back in. If the check valve becomes stuck open, dirty water from the drain line can re-enter the dishwasher tub after the drain cycle has finished. If it gets stuck closed, it can completely block water from leaving the dishwasher. This blockage acts like a dam, leaving standing water.

The sump assembly is the lowest part of the dishwasher tub where water collects before being pumped out. It houses the drain pump, filter, and often the heating element. If the sump itself becomes excessively clogged with debris or if there is an issue with the passages leading to the drain pump within the sump, it can restrict water flow. This means the pump cannot draw all the water out, leaving some behind.

### Inspecting the Check Valve and Sump

To inspect the check valve, you will usually need to access the drain pump area, often by removing the lower spray arm and filter assembly. The check valve might be a small flap or ball inside a housing near where the drain hose connects to the pump. Check if it moves freely and is not obstructed by debris. Gently clear any visible buildup. If the valve itself is broken or corroded, it will need replacement.

Inspecting the sump assembly involves removing the filters and checking for any large items or significant buildup in the bottom of the tub. Sometimes, small bones, broken glass, or even a foreign object can get lodged in the sump, blocking the intake for the drain pump. Use a flashlight to get a good look and carefully remove any obstructions. If the issue persists after clearing these areas, it might indicate a more complex internal problem with the sump's design or a hidden obstruction, requiring a technician's expertise. Proper maintenance of these areas is crucial, even for understanding if and [Can a Dishwasher Drain Without Being On?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-dishwasher-drain-when-not-on).

## Float Switch Malfunction

Your dishwasher has a built-in safety mechanism called the float switch. This component detects the water level inside the tub. It serves two main functions: preventing the dishwasher from overflowing by shutting off the water inlet, and ensuring there is enough water for the wash cycle. If the float switch malfunctions, it can trick the dishwasher into thinking it has too much water, even if it does not. This false signal can stop the drain pump from activating.

A float switch typically consists of a plastic float that rises with the water level and a sensor or switch below it. If the float gets stuck in the "up" position, it signals to the dishwasher's control board that the tub is full. The control board will then prevent the dishwasher from filling more water and, critically, might also prevent the drain cycle from starting or completing. This leaves standing water in the tub, as the dishwasher thinks it is already "full" and has no reason to pump out more.

### How to Check the Float Switch

Checking the float switch is a relatively simple diagnostic step. First, ensure your dishwasher is unplugged from its power source to prevent electrical shock. Locate the float switch inside the dishwasher tub. It is usually a small, mushroom-shaped plastic cap or a round disc found at the bottom of the tub, often near the front.

Gently press down on the float. It should move freely up and down without sticking. If it feels stiff or does not move, it might be stuck. Remove any visible debris, such as food particles, soap scum, or mineral deposits, that might be causing it to stick. You can use a soft brush or a damp cloth for cleaning. If the float moves freely but the dishwasher still does not drain, the internal switch mechanism itself might be faulty. In this case, the float switch may need to be replaced. This is a common part that can be found and installed with moderate DIY skills.
