Opening your Whirlpool dishwasher and being hit with an unpleasant odor is a common problem. Many homeowners experience this frustrating issue. A **smelly Whirlpool dishwasher** can indicate several underlying problems, ranging from simple food residue buildup to more complex drainage issues. I understand how much you rely on a fresh-smelling appliance. This guide will help you understand why your dishwasher smells bad. We will provide clear, actionable steps to eliminate those odors and keep your appliance fresh. You will learn to identify the source of the smell and implement effective cleaning and maintenance routines.

### Takeaway

*   Regularly clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter to remove trapped food particles.
*   Address standing water promptly by checking the drain hose and air gap.

*   Use the correct detergent type and amount, and load dishes properly.

### Why does my Whirlpool dishwasher smell?

Your Whirlpool dishwasher often smells due to trapped food particles, grease buildup, mold, or mildew inside the machine. These organic materials decompose and produce foul odors. Poor drainage or infrequent cleaning also contributes to the problem. Fixing these issues typically involves thorough cleaning and proper maintenance.

## Understanding Common Causes of a Smelly Whirlpool Dishwasher

A strange smell coming from your Whirlpool dishwasher can feel unpleasant. It is more than just an annoyance; it signals a problem. Most odors develop because of leftover food, grease, or grime. These things collect in various parts of the dishwasher. Your appliance may also smell from mold and mildew growth.

Small food pieces often wash off dishes during a cycle. They then get caught in the filter or other crevices. Over time, these particles rot. They create a foul odor, like old food. Grease and soap scum can also build up on the interior walls. This creates a sticky film where bacteria grow. This bacterial growth causes many bad smells. It is important to clean your dishwasher regularly to prevent this.

Sometimes, the smell comes from water that does not drain completely. Standing water can become stagnant. It creates a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. This is a common issue that needs quick attention. You might notice a musty or mildew smell in this case. Addressing these common causes will lead to a fresher appliance. You may find similar smell issues with other brands, as dirty components can cause a bad smell for any appliance.

## The Crucial Role of Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter

Your Whirlpool dishwasher filter plays a vital role in preventing odors. The filter catches food particles and debris. This prevents them from recirculating onto your dishes. If the filter is not cleaned, these trapped particles start to decompose. This decomposition produces a very unpleasant smell. It is a main reason your **Whirlpool dishwasher smells**.

Cleaning the filter is a simple task. I recommend doing it at least once a month. You might need to clean it more often if you wash very dirty dishes. Most Whirlpool dishwashers have a removable filter. You twist it to unlock it. Then, you lift it out. Rinse the filter under running water to remove all food debris. Use a soft brush and a little dish soap to scrub away stubborn grime. You can find detailed instructions on [how to clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-whirlpool-dishwasher-filter).

After cleaning, place the filter back into its position. Make sure it clicks securely into place. A properly installed filter ensures efficient dishwasher operation. It also keeps your appliance smelling clean. Neglecting this part of maintenance is a frequent cause of bad odors. After cleaning, be sure you know [how to put your Whirlpool dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-whirlpool-dishwasher-filter-back-in) correctly.

## Addressing Odors from Standing Water in Your Whirlpool Dishwasher

Standing water at the bottom of your Whirlpool dishwasher is a strong indicator of an odor problem. This water becomes stagnant quickly. It creates an environment for bacteria and mold to thrive. The result is a foul, musty smell. This issue often points to a drainage problem.

First, check your dishwasher's drain hose. It might be kinked or clogged. Make sure the hose has a high loop. This high loop prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If the hose is clear, the issue could be with the air gap. The air gap is a small fixture on your countertop near the faucet. It prevents drain water from siphoning back into the dishwasher. Debris can clog it. Remove its cap and clear any blockages you find. This will help resolve standing water issues. If your [Whirlpool dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom), addressing it immediately is key.

A clogged drain pump or a faulty check valve can also cause standing water. The drain pump removes water from the dishwasher. If it fails, water stays inside. The check valve stops water from returning to the tub after draining. If it sticks open, water can flow back. For these deeper issues, you might need professional help. However, checking the basic drainage components is a good first step. If your [Whirlpool dishwasher fills with water but does not wash](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-fill-with-water-but-not-wash), it could also be a drainage-related problem causing the smell.

## Tackling Mold and Mildew in Your Whirlpool Dishwasher

Mold and mildew love dark, damp places. Your Whirlpool dishwasher provides an ideal environment for them. You will often notice a musty or earthy smell when mold grows. This growth typically appears on the rubber gaskets around the door. It also grows on the spray arms and interior walls. Mold and mildew contribute heavily to a **smelly Whirlpool dishwasher**.

To remove mold, use a mixture of white vinegar and water. Dampen a cloth with this solution. Wipe down all visible mold. Pay special attention to the door gasket. Mold loves to hide in its folds. For stubborn areas, a soft brush can help. You can also run an empty cycle with two cups of white vinegar in a dishwasher-safe bowl on the top rack. This helps clean the interior.

After the vinegar cycle, sprinkle baking soda on the bottom of the dishwasher. Then, run a short hot water cycle. Baking soda absorbs odors. It also helps scrub away any remaining residue. Do this regularly, perhaps once a month, to keep mold at bay. Ensure proper ventilation after each cycle. Leave the dishwasher door slightly ajar for a while. This allows moisture to escape. It prevents new mold from forming. Addressing mold in a stainless steel dishwasher is also important if you have one, as [a stainless steel dishwasher can smell bad](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-stainless-steel-dishwasher-smell-bad) from similar causes.

## The Importance of Proper Dishwasher Loading and Detergent Use

Proper loading and detergent use are more important than you might think for preventing a smelly Whirlpool dishwasher. Incorrect loading can block spray arms. This prevents water and detergent from reaching all dishes. Food particles then remain on dishes and inside the dishwasher. This left-behind food becomes a source of bad smells. I always tell people to avoid overcrowding the racks. Give water a clear path. Place larger items in the back or sides. Make sure bowls and cups face downwards.

The type and amount of detergent also matter greatly. Using too little detergent means dishes do not get clean enough. Leftover food then causes odors. Too much detergent, especially with hard water, creates excessive suds. This leaves behind a sticky film. This film traps food particles and promotes bacterial growth. Always use detergent specifically for dishwashers. Measure the correct amount for your water hardness and soil level. Many modern detergents are concentrated. A small amount often works best.

Consider using a rinse aid. Rinse aid helps water sheet off dishes. This reduces water spots and aids drying. It also helps prevent water from pooling. Less standing water means fewer opportunities for odors to form. Choosing the right products and loading correctly keeps your dishwasher running cleanly. It helps your kitchen smell fresh.

## Maintaining Your Whirlpool Dishwasher for Long-Term Freshness

Regular maintenance is key to preventing your Whirlpool dishwasher from smelling bad. Beyond cleaning the filter, other steps keep your appliance fresh. I make sure to do these things consistently. First, run a monthly cleaning cycle. Place a cup of white vinegar in a dishwasher-safe bowl on the top rack. Run the dishwasher on its hottest setting. This helps remove grease, soap scum, and hard water deposits. These deposits can trap food particles.

After the vinegar cycle, sprinkle a cup of baking soda on the bottom of the empty dishwasher. Run a short, hot water rinse cycle. Baking soda absorbs any lingering odors. It also helps to freshen the interior. You can also use commercial dishwasher cleaners. These products specifically target tough buildup and odors. Follow the product instructions carefully.

Do not forget to clean the spray arms. Food debris can block the small holes on the spray arms. This reduces washing efficiency. Remove the spray arms if possible and rinse them. Use a small wire or toothpick to clear any clogged holes. Also, wipe down the door seal regularly. Food and grime often collect there. Keeping all parts clean ensures your dishwasher works well. It will smell fresh every time you open it. This regular cleaning prevents many odor issues.

## When to Call a Professional for Your Smelly Whirlpool Dishwasher

Sometimes, even after thorough cleaning, your Whirlpool dishwasher still smells. This usually indicates a deeper problem. I understand the frustration when DIY fixes do not work. At this point, it is wise to consider professional help. Certain mechanical issues can cause persistent odors. These problems require a technician's expertise.

One common issue is a failing drain pump. If the pump does not fully expel water, it will sit and stagnate. This leads to a persistent, foul smell. Another issue could be a faulty check valve. This valve prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If it is broken, wastewater can re-enter the tub. This causes odors. You may also have problems with the garbage disposal if your dishwasher drains into it. A clogged disposal can back up into the dishwasher.

Persistent mold growth, even after cleaning, might mean mold is growing in inaccessible areas. These areas include the drain hose or internal plumbing. A professional can properly diagnose and address these hidden issues. They have specialized tools and knowledge. Attempting complex repairs yourself can cause further damage. It could also void your warranty. If you have tried all common solutions and your **Whirlpool dishwasher smells** strongly, call an appliance repair technician. They can restore your dishwasher's performance and freshness.

## FAQ Section

### Why does my Whirlpool dishwasher smell like rotten eggs?

### Does overloading my dishwasher make it smell?
Yes, overloading your dishwasher can make it smell. Too many dishes block water circulation. This prevents proper cleaning. Food residue then remains on dishes and inside the dishwasher. This leads to bacterial growth and unpleasant odors. Load your dishwasher properly for best results.
