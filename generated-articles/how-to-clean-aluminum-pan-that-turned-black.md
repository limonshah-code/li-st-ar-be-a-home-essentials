**How do you clean an aluminum pan that has turned black?**
You clean an aluminum pan that turned black by using acidic solutions like white vinegar or lemon juice. These acids neutralize the oxidation causing the black discoloration. Boiling the pan with water and an acidic agent, or scrubbing with a paste of baking soda and water, removes the dark stains effectively.

### Why Your Aluminum Pan Turns Black: Understanding the Discoloration

An aluminum pan that turned black signals a chemical reaction. Aluminum is a reactive metal. It forms a protective oxide layer when exposed to air. This layer usually keeps the pan from corroding. Certain foods and cleaning agents can cause this layer to thicken or change color.

Highly alkaline foods are a common culprit. Potatoes, cauliflower, and even some hard tap water contain minerals that react with aluminum. Cooking these items can lead to a dark, oxidized film inside the pan. Dishwasher detergents are another major cause. Many detergents are very alkaline. They strip the protective layer and cause the pan to darken. Harsh scrubbing or abrasive cleaners can also damage the surface. This damage makes the pan more prone to discoloration. Understanding these causes helps you prevent future blackening. It ensures your cleaning efforts last longer.

### Essential Supplies for Cleaning Blackened Aluminum Pans

Before you begin cleaning your aluminum pan, gather your materials. You will need a few simple items. Most of these are likely already in your kitchen. Having everything ready makes the cleaning process smooth.

Here is a list of what you will need:
