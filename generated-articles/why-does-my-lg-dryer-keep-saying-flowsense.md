## Understanding Your LG Dryer's FlowSense System

Your LG dryer includes a smart feature called FlowSense. This system monitors airflow through the dryer's exhaust duct. It acts as a safety and efficiency mechanism. The dryer needs good airflow to work correctly. Without proper airflow, drying takes longer. Restricted airflow also creates a fire hazard.

LG designed FlowSense to protect your home. The system detects when air cannot move freely. It uses sensors to measure air pressure. When the pressure drops below a safe level, it triggers the alert. This alert tells you to check the ventilation. You can see the FlowSense message on the dryer display. Sometimes the dryer also stops operating. You must address this alert quickly. Ignoring it can lead to poor drying performance. It can also increase energy use and fire risk. This sensor is crucial for safe dryer operation.

### How FlowSense Protects Your Home

FlowSense prevents overheating. A dryer generates a lot of heat. This heat needs to escape through the exhaust vent. If the vent is blocked, heat builds up inside the dryer. This can damage internal components. More importantly, it can ignite lint. Lint is highly flammable. The FlowSense system helps avoid such dangerous situations. It warns you before a serious problem develops. This feature adds a layer of safety to your appliance.

The system also optimizes drying cycles. When airflow is good, clothes dry faster. They use less energy. The FlowSense alert tells you when efficiency drops. Addressing the alert restores proper drying times. It helps you save on electricity bills. This system provides peace of mind. It ensures your dryer operates safely and effectively.

## Common Causes of the FlowSense Alert

Several issues can trigger the LG FlowSense alert. Most relate to blocked airflow. Understanding these causes helps you find the problem faster. A common culprit is a dirty lint filter. Lint collects here with every load. Another major cause involves the dryer exhaust vent. This vent carries moist air outside. Blockages in the vent trap air. External vent hoods also get clogged.

### Clogged Lint Filter

The lint filter traps lint from your clothes. This is its main job. You should clean it after every use. A thick layer of lint blocks airflow. This blockage triggers the FlowSense warning. It prevents moist air from leaving the dryer. This makes drying cycles longer. It also wastes energy. [Many dryer models alert you to clean the filter regularly](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-keep-saying-clean-filter). Always check this filter first when you see the FlowSense alert. Pull it out and remove all the lint. A clean filter is essential for efficient drying.

### Blocked Dryer Exhaust Vent

The dryer vent system moves hot, moist air outside. This system includes flexible ductwork. It connects to a rigid duct in your wall. This duct leads to an outdoor vent hood. Lint can build up along this entire path. This buildup restricts airflow significantly. A blockage in the exhaust vent is a very common cause of FlowSense. This problem can also make your LG dryer take a long time to dry clothes. [When your LG dryer takes too long to dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-take-so-long-to-dry), restricted airflow is a likely reason. Regular cleaning of the dryer vent is important. This prevents performance issues and safety hazards.

### Restricted External Vent Hood

The outdoor vent hood can become blocked. Lint can build up around the flap or screen. Birds' nests or small animals might also block it. This external blockage stops air from leaving. It directly impacts the FlowSense system. Check the vent hood from outside your home. Clear any debris. Make sure the flap opens freely. This step is often overlooked. It is vital for full airflow.

### Kinked or Damaged Dryer Duct

The flexible duct connecting your dryer to the wall vent can kink. This happens if the dryer sits too close to the wall. A kink severely restricts airflow. It creates a bottleneck. The duct can also get crushed or torn. This damages the airflow path. Inspect the duct behind your dryer. Make sure it runs smoothly. There should be no sharp bends or compression. Replace damaged ductwork immediately. You can check [how to clean your dryer thoroughly](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-dryer) which includes checking ductwork.

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting for FlowSense

You can fix most FlowSense issues yourself. Start with the simplest checks. Move to more involved steps. Always unplug your dryer before performing any internal checks. Safety is most important. Follow these steps methodically.

### Step 1: Clean the Lint Filter

This is the easiest and most common fix. Remove the lint filter from its slot. Pull off all accumulated lint. Hold the filter up to a light. Can you see light through it? If not, it needs deeper cleaning. Sometimes detergent residue or fabric softener can clog the mesh. Wash the filter with warm, soapy water. Use a soft brush to scrub it gently. Rinse it thoroughly. Let it air dry completely before putting it back. A clean lint filter greatly improves airflow. My LG dryer usually runs better after I do this.

### Step 2: Inspect the Dryer Vent Hose

Pull the dryer away from the wall. This lets you access the back. Disconnect the flexible vent hose. It usually connects with a clamp. Check inside the hose for lint buildup. Feel for any clogs. Also, look for kinks or crushed sections. Flexible foil vents are prone to kinking. Consider replacing them with rigid metal ducting. Rigid ducts offer better airflow. They are less likely to crush. Clear any visible lint from the hose. Use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment.

### Step 3: Clean the Dryer Exhaust Duct (In-Wall/Floor)

Lint builds up inside the rigid ductwork over time. This is the duct hidden in your wall or floor. You need a dryer vent cleaning brush kit. These kits come with long, flexible rods. Attach the brush to the rods. Push the brush through the duct from the dryer end. Work it back and forth. This dislodges lint. A vacuum cleaner can also help suck out the loosened lint. Clean until no more lint comes out. You might need to clean the vent from the outside too. [Learn more about how to clean an LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer). This ensures comprehensive cleaning.

### Step 4: Check the External Vent Hood

Go outside your house. Locate the dryer vent hood. It's usually a small box or pipe coming out of the wall. Check for lint buildup around the opening. Make sure the flap or louver opens freely. Birds or small animals can nest inside. Remove any debris or obstructions. Use a brush or your hand to clear it. Ensure the flap moves easily. This allows hot, moist air to escape.

### Step 5: Verify Proper Dryer Installation

Sometimes the FlowSense issue relates to how the dryer is installed. The dryer needs enough space behind it. This prevents the vent hose from kinking. The vent path should be as short and straight as possible. Excessive turns or long vent runs reduce airflow. Review your dryer's installation manual. Make sure your setup follows recommendations. If you have questions about side venting, for instance, you can refer to resources about [whether an LG dryer can be vented from the side](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-an-lg-dryer-be-vented-from-the-side).
