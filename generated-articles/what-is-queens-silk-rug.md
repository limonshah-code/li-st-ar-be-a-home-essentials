These historical roots lay the foundation for what we now consider a Queens Silk Rug.

Traditional silk rugs were made for royalty and nobles. They were symbols of wealth and power. Emperors and kings commissioned these rugs. They wanted unique designs and the finest materials. This history contributes to the "Queens" designation. It connects modern high-quality silk rugs to this ancient tradition of royal patronage.

### Unraveling the Craftsmanship: How Queens Silk Rugs are Made

The creation of a Queens Silk Rug is a labor of love and immense skill. It involves a detailed hand-knotting process. This process sets these rugs apart from machine-made alternatives. Each knot is tied by hand. This takes countless hours. Many skilled artisans work together to complete one rug. Their dedication makes each rug unique.

#### The Art of Hand-Knotting

The hand-knotting process begins with a foundation. This foundation is made of warp and weft threads. Artisans sit at a loom. They tie individual silk knots onto the warp threads. These knots form the pile of the rug. There are two main types of knots: the Persian (Senneh) knot and the Turkish (Ghiordes) knot. The choice of knot affects the rug's texture and pattern clarity. A high knot count per square inch means a denser, more detailed rug. Queens Silk Rugs often boast very high knot counts. This high density allows for extremely fine designs. It also makes the rug more durable.

#### Premium Silk Materials

The quality of the silk is very important. Queens Silk Rugs use premium silk. This silk typically comes from mulberry silkworms. Mulberry silk is known for its strength, softness, and natural sheen. The silk fibers are carefully spun into fine threads. These threads are then dyed using natural pigments. Natural dyes create rich, lasting colors. They also give the rug a unique depth. The colors do not fade easily over time. This makes the rug even more valuable.

The entire process, from preparing the silk to tying the last knot, requires immense patience. It demands precision from the weavers. This deep commitment to detail ensures a rug that is beautiful and durable. The time and effort put into each rug reflect its value. It becomes a piece of art that tells a story of human skill. This is why a Queens Silk Rug is so special. It is a true masterpiece of textile art.
