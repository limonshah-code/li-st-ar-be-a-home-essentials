## Fixing Your LG Dishwasher NE Error

There is nothing more frustrating than loading your dishwasher, starting a cycle, and then seeing an error code. If you own an LG dishwasher, you might encounter the dreaded NE error. This code indicates a problem with the dishwasher's water distribution system, specifically related to the nozzle or spray arm function. When this happens, your dishes will not get clean.

Understanding the LG dishwasher NE error code is the first step to resolving the issue. This guide provides a detailed look at common causes behind this error. I will walk you through clear, simple steps to fix spray arm blockages, low water pressure, and diverter motor problems. You can get your LG dishwasher working properly again and enjoy sparkling clean dishes.

### Takeaway

*   Check spray arms for blockages and clean them regularly.
*   Verify your home's water pressure and ensure the inlet valve screen is clear.
*   Inspect and test the diverter motor; replace it if it is faulty.
*   Examine wiring connections for damage or looseness.
*   Consider a faulty control board if other steps fail.

The LG dishwasher NE error means the dishwasher detects a problem with water not spraying correctly from the nozzles or spray arms. You can usually fix this by cleaning the spray arms, checking water supply, or inspecting the diverter motor. These steps often resolve the issue without professional help.

## Understanding the LG Dishwasher NE Error Code

When your LG dishwasher displays an NE error code, it points to a "Nozzle Error." This means the appliance is not sensing proper water flow through its spray arms. The dishwasher needs water to spray effectively to clean dishes. If water flow is weak, blocked, or misdirected, the NE error will appear. This error often stops the wash cycle, leaving dishes dirty.

Common symptoms beyond the code itself include dirty dishes after a cycle, poor rinsing, or a wash cycle that seems to stop early. You might also hear unusual noises, like humming or grinding, from the dishwasher. These sounds can indicate a component struggling to move water. Addressing the NE error quickly ensures your dishwasher functions as intended. I find it important to understand what the error means before attempting any fixes.

### Initial Checks for NE Error

Before you dive into technical repairs, perform a few simple checks. These initial steps can often resolve minor issues. First, always try a power cycle. This is a basic troubleshooting step for many electronic devices. It can clear temporary glitches in the system.

To power cycle your LG dishwasher:

1.  Unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet. If it is hardwired, flip the circuit breaker off.
2.  Wait for at least five minutes. This allows the internal components to fully discharge.
3.  Plug the dishwasher back in or flip the circuit breaker on.
4.  Turn on the dishwasher and try to start a new cycle.

Sometimes, a simple power reset is all you need. If the NE error returns immediately, you know the problem is more persistent. You then need to investigate further. This basic check helps rule out minor electronic hiccups. It ensures you focus on physical or mechanical problems if the error persists.

## Checking for Blockages in the Spray Arms

One of the most common reasons for an LG dishwasher NE error is blocked spray arms. The spray arms are the spinning components inside your dishwasher that shoot water onto your dishes. Over time, food particles, hard water deposits, or small debris can clog the tiny holes in these arms. When these holes are blocked, water cannot spray out effectively. The dishwasher's sensors detect this lack of proper water distribution. This then triggers the NE error code.

Maintaining clean spray arms is vital for your dishwasher's performance. If you notice your dishes are not getting clean, or if you see the NE error, spray arm inspection is a good starting point. This is often an easy fix you can do yourself. I always recommend checking these components first because they are so prone to clogs. You might be surprised how much gunk can accumulate in these small holes.

### Removing and Cleaning Spray Arms

Cleaning your spray arms is a straightforward process. You do not need special tools. Most LG dishwasher spray arms twist off or simply unclip. Here is how you can do it:

1.  **Locate the Spray Arms:** Your LG dishwasher usually has two or three spray arms. One is at the bottom, one in the middle (under the top rack), and sometimes a third at the very top.
2.  **Remove the Racks:** Pull out the dish racks to give yourself full access to the spray arms. This makes the removal process much easier.
3.  **Detach the Spray Arms:**
    *   The lower spray arm typically lifts straight up off a central post or unscrews from a nut.
    *   The middle spray arm often unthreads counter-clockwise or unclips from its mounting.
    *   The upper spray arm might require more careful handling, often twisting off.
    Refer to your LG dishwasher's user manual if you have trouble.
4.  **Inspect and Clear Holes:** Hold each spray arm up to a light. Look for any clogged holes. Use a toothpick, a small wire, or a straightened paperclip to poke through any blocked openings. Make sure every hole is clear.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Run water through the spray arms to flush out any loosened debris. You can do this under a sink faucet. Ensure water flows freely from all holes.
6.  **Clean the Arm Surface:** You might also want to clean the entire surface of the spray arm with a soft brush and warm, soapy water. This removes any film or residue that could contribute to future clogs.
7.  **Reinstall:** Reattach the spray arms securely. Ensure they can spin freely without hitting anything. Test their rotation by hand.

After cleaning, run a short cycle without dishes. This helps flush out any remaining debris. It also confirms the NE error is gone. Sometimes, blocked spray arms can also impact the dishwasher's ability to drain properly, leading to other issues. If you notice drainage problems, consider exploring solutions like those for [how to fix an LG dishwasher that won't drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-an-lg-dishwasher-that-wont-drain). A clear water path is essential for overall dishwasher function.

## Investigating Water Pressure and Supply Issues

The LG dishwasher NE error can also stem from insufficient water pressure or problems with the water supply. Your dishwasher needs a consistent flow of water at adequate pressure to operate correctly. If the water supply is restricted, the spray arms will not receive enough force to distribute water effectively. The dishwasher's sensors will detect this issue. This then triggers the NE error.

Several factors can cause low water pressure to your dishwasher. This includes issues with your home's main water supply, kinks in the inlet hose, or a malfunctioning water inlet valve. It is important to check these components to ensure your dishwasher gets the water it needs. I always recommend checking the most obvious causes first before moving to more complex diagnostics.

### Checking Household Water Pressure

First, check the overall water pressure in your home. Low pressure can affect all your appliances, not just the dishwasher.

*   **Faucet Test:** Turn on a nearby kitchen faucet to full hot and cold. Is the water flow strong and consistent? If it seems weak, the issue might be with your home's main water supply.
*   **Main Water Valve:** Ensure the main water shut-off valve for your house is fully open. Sometimes, it might be partially closed, reducing water pressure.
*   **Dishwasher Water Supply Valve:** Locate the water shut-off valve for the dishwasher itself, usually under the sink. Make sure this valve is fully open. A partially closed valve will restrict water flow.

### Inspecting the Water Inlet Valve Screen

Your dishwasher has a water inlet valve. This valve controls the flow of water into the appliance. It often has a small mesh screen or filter. This screen prevents sediment and debris from entering the dishwasher. Over time, this screen can become clogged, restricting water flow.

To check and clean the water inlet valve screen:

1.  **Turn Off Water and Power:** Shut off the water supply to the dishwasher at the under-sink valve. Unplug the dishwasher or turn off its circuit breaker. This is a crucial safety step when working with water and electricity.
2.  **Locate the Inlet Hose:** Find the water inlet hose connected to the back of the dishwasher. It is typically a flexible braided hose.
3.  **Disconnect the Hose:** Use a wrench to carefully disconnect the inlet hose from the dishwasher's water inlet valve. Be prepared for a small amount of water to leak out. Have a towel ready.
4.  **Inspect the Screen:** Look inside the threaded opening of the water inlet valve where the hose connects. You will see a small mesh screen. If it is clogged with debris, carefully remove it. You might need needle-nose pliers or tweezers.
5.  **Clean the Screen:** Rinse the screen under running water. Use a small brush or a toothpick to gently remove any stubborn debris. Do not use sharp objects that could damage the mesh.
6.  **Reinstall:** Once the screen is clean, reinsert it into the valve. Reconnect the water inlet hose securely.
7.  **Restore Power and Water:** Turn the water supply back on. Then, restore power to the dishwasher.
8.  **Test:** Run a short wash cycle to see if the NE error has cleared.

Ensuring proper water pressure and a clear inlet valve screen is essential for your dishwasher's performance. If your dishwasher has other water-related error codes, like an "over-level water error" on other brands, some of these water supply troubleshooting steps might also apply, even if the error code is different. For example, similar water flow issues might be seen in other dishwashers, such as when you might troubleshoot a [Samsung dishwasher over-level water error](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-samsung-dishwasher-over-level-water-error). Always check your specific appliance's manual for details.

## Troubleshooting the Diverter Motor Assembly

The diverter motor plays a critical role in your LG dishwasher's water distribution. It directs water to different spray arms at various stages of the wash cycle. For example, it might send water to the upper spray arm for delicate items and then switch to the lower spray arm for heavily soiled pots. If the diverter motor malfunctions, water may not reach the correct spray arms or may not spray with enough force. This leads to the NE error code.

A faulty diverter motor can manifest in several ways. You might hear strange grinding or buzzing noises during the cycle. Sometimes, water only sprays from one set of arms, or no water sprays at all. Diagnosing a diverter motor problem requires a bit more effort than cleaning spray arms. However, it is a common cause for the NE error. This component is crucial for proper water flow. I often find this to be the culprit when basic checks do not resolve the issue.

### How to Test for a Faulty Diverter Motor

Testing the diverter motor usually involves checking its electrical continuity and its mechanical function.

1.  **Safety First:** Disconnect power to your dishwasher at the circuit breaker. Turn off the water supply valve. This is non-negotiable for your safety.
2.  **Access the Diverter Motor:** The diverter motor is typically located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, usually underneath the sump area. You might need to remove the lower spray arm, filter assembly, and possibly a sump cover to access it. This involves laying the dishwasher on its side or pulling it out from under the counter. Refer to your LG dishwasher's service manual or a specific repair video for your model.
3.  **Visual Inspection:** Once you access the motor, inspect it for any visible signs of damage, such as burnt wires, corrosion, or cracks. Also, check if the impeller or diverter disc connected to the motor moves freely. It should not be jammed by debris.
4.  **Electrical Test (Continuity):** Use a multimeter to test the electrical continuity of the diverter motor. Disconnect the electrical connectors from the motor. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. Place the probes on the motor's terminals. Consult your dishwasher's wiring diagram or service manual for the correct resistance values. A reading outside the specified range, or no continuity at all, indicates a faulty motor.
5.  **Mechanical Test (Manual Rotation):** If accessible, try to manually turn the shaft or disc on the diverter motor. It should move smoothly without excessive resistance. If it feels stuck or grinds, the internal gears or components might be worn out.

### Steps for Diverter Motor Replacement

If your testing confirms the diverter motor is faulty, replacement is usually the solution.

1.  **Purchase the Correct Part:** Order a replacement diverter motor specific to your LG dishwasher model. Make sure the part number matches.
2.  **Disconnect Wires and Hoses:** Carefully disconnect all electrical wires and any water hoses connected to the old diverter motor. Label them if necessary to ensure proper reinstallation.
3.  **Remove Old Motor:** Unmount the old diverter motor. It might be held in place by screws, clips, or a twisting mechanism.
4.  **Install New Motor:** Position the new diverter motor in place. Secure it with the screws or clips you removed earlier.
5.  **Reconnect Wires and Hoses:** Reattach all electrical connectors and water hoses to the new motor. Double-check all connections to ensure they are secure and correctly fitted.
6.  **Reassemble Dishwasher:** Put back any filters, spray arms, or sump covers you removed. Ensure everything is correctly aligned.
7.  **Test:** Restore water and power to your dishwasher. Run a diagnostic cycle or a normal wash cycle to confirm the NE error is gone and water is distributing properly.

Replacing the diverter motor can be a bit challenging, but it is a repair many homeowners can complete with patience. Sometimes, other LG dishwasher errors, such as the [LG dishwasher code BE](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-dishwasher-code-be), might also involve accessing internal components or dealing with electrical connections. Always prioritize safety and consult your model's specific service manual for detailed instructions.

## Examining the Dishwasher's Wiring and Connections

Electrical problems can easily cause an LG dishwasher NE error. The diverter motor, spray arm sensors, and main control board all rely on sound electrical connections to function. If wires are loose, frayed, or damaged, the necessary signals might not reach these components. This results in the dishwasher not understanding how to properly distribute water. It then displays the NE error code.

A thorough inspection of the wiring harness and connections is a crucial troubleshooting step. You are looking for any signs of wear, breaks, or disconnections. Rodents can also chew through wires, causing intermittent or complete failures. I always advise a careful visual check after exhausting mechanical possibilities. This ensures electrical integrity.

### Where to Check Connections

You will need to access different areas of the dishwasher to inspect the wiring. Always ensure the dishwasher is unplugged from the power outlet or the circuit breaker is off before touching any electrical components.

1.  **Behind the Kick Plate:** Remove the lower kick plate at the bottom front of the dishwasher. You might find connections related to the water inlet valve or main power supply here. Look for loose terminals or chewed wires.
2.  **Under the Dishwasher (Sump Area):** If you access the diverter motor, you will also see its wiring. Check the connectors going to the diverter motor and any sensors in the sump. Ensure they are firmly seated.
3.  **Control Panel Area:** The wiring that connects the control panel to the main control board can sometimes become loose. This might involve carefully removing the outer door panel. Look for any wires that have come unclipped or appear stressed.
4.  **Main Control Board Connections:** The main control board is the brain of your dishwasher. All major components, including the diverter motor and sensors, connect to it. Inspect all harnesses plugged into the main control board for tightness and damage.
5.  **Door Latch Wires:** Although less common for an NE error, sometimes wiring related to the door latch can impact cycle initiation. Ensure these are secure.

### Safety Precautions

Working with electrical components carries risks. Always follow these safety measures:

*   **Disconnect Power:** This is the most important step. Always unplug the dishwasher or shut off its circuit breaker before starting any inspection or repair. Do not rely on simply turning the dishwasher off.
*   **Wear Gloves:** Insulated gloves can provide an extra layer of protection, especially if you are unsure about live wires (though you should always ensure power is off).
*   **Avoid Water:** Ensure the area is dry when working with electrical components. Water and electricity are a dangerous combination.
*   **Document:** Take pictures or notes of wire connections before disconnecting them. This helps you remember where everything goes during reassembly.
*   **Use Proper Tools:** Use insulated tools when working with wires. Avoid using damaged or makeshift tools.
*   **Professional Help:** If you are uncomfortable working with electrical wiring, call a qualified appliance technician. Do not take unnecessary risks.

If you find any loose connections, firmly reattach them. If you find frayed or damaged wires, they need replacement. You can typically find replacement wiring harnesses specific to your LG dishwasher model. Repairing wiring often requires basic electrical skills, such as splicing wires or crimping new connectors. This step is critical because proper electrical flow ensures accurate communication between all dishwasher parts.

## Addressing a Faulty Main Control Board

If you have cleaned the spray arms, confirmed good water pressure, and checked the diverter motor and wiring, yet your LG dishwasher still shows an NE error, the issue might lie with the main control board. The control board is like the brain of your dishwasher. It receives signals from various sensors, processes them, and then sends commands to components like the diverter motor, water inlet valve, and wash pump. If the control board malfunctions, it might misinterpret sensor readings or fail to send proper commands. This results in the NE error.

A faulty main control board is less common than other issues. However, it can certainly be the cause of persistent, unexplained error codes. This is typically a last resort in troubleshooting. I usually consider the control board if all other, simpler solutions have failed. It is an expensive part, so you want to be sure it is the problem before replacing it.

### Signs of a Bad Control Board

Identifying a faulty control board can be tricky because its symptoms can mimic other problems. However, some specific indicators suggest the control board is failing:

*   **Intermittent Errors:** The NE error appears randomly, sometimes clearing on its own, only to return later without any clear pattern.
*   **Multiple Unrelated Errors:** If your dishwasher is showing the NE error alongside other unrelated error codes (e.g., draining issues, heating problems) at the same time, it strongly suggests a central control issue.
*   **Dishwasher Not Responding:** The dishwasher might become completely unresponsive, lights might flicker, or buttons may not work.
*   **Component Malfunctions:** Even after replacing a component like the diverter motor, the NE error persists. This indicates the component itself might be fine, but the board is not controlling it properly.
*   **Burnt Smell or Visible Damage:** In rare cases, you might notice a burning smell from the control panel or visible burn marks on the control board itself. This is a clear sign of board failure.

### Professional vs. DIY Replacement Considerations

Replacing a main control board is a more advanced repair. Here are some considerations:

*   **DIY Replacement:**
    *   **Access:** The control board is usually located behind the control panel at the top of the dishwasher door or sometimes in a sealed box at the bottom. Accessing it involves careful disassembly of the door panel or lower access panels.
    *   **Cost Savings:** You save on labor costs by doing it yourself.
    *   **Complexity:** It involves disconnecting numerous wire harnesses. You must accurately match the new board to your model. It requires careful handling of sensitive electronics.
    *   **Risk:** An incorrect installation can damage the new board or other dishwasher components. It can also pose electrical safety risks.

*   **Professional Replacement:**
    *   **Expertise:** A certified technician has the experience to accurately diagnose a control board issue. They can install the new board correctly.
    *   **Warranty:** Professional repairs often come with a warranty on parts and labor.
    *   **Cost:** This is the most expensive option due to labor fees.
    *   **Convenience:** You do not have to spend your time and effort on the repair.

Before replacing the control board, ensure you have exhausted all other troubleshooting steps. Always get
