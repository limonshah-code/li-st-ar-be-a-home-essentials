This electronic brain directs all dishwasher functions. Knowing how to test a Whirlpool dishwasher control board can save you money. You can avoid costly service calls and determine if you need a new part.

Many dishwasher problems trace back to the control board. Issues like cycles not starting or strange error codes often point here. I have faced these frustrating moments myself. This guide offers a clear path to diagnose your Whirlpool dishwasher. We will cover safety, access, and multimeter testing methods. You will gain confidence in handling this repair. Let us empower you to keep your kitchen running smoothly.

### Takeaway

*   Always disconnect power before working on your dishwasher.
*   Locate the control board, usually behind the control panel or kickplate.
*   Inspect the board for visible damage like burn marks or corrosion.
*   Use a multimeter to test for proper voltage and continuity at specific points.
*   Confirm symptoms match common control board failures before replacing.

To test a Whirlpool dishwasher control board, first disconnect power to the appliance. Then, access the control board, typically behind the door panel or toe kick. Visually inspect the board for damage. Finally, use a multimeter to check for correct voltage readings and continuity at key connection points. This identifies circuit issues.

## Understanding Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Control Board

The control board is the central processing unit of your Whirlpool dishwasher. It sends signals to all components. It tells the wash pump when to run and the heating element when to heat. Every cycle, from pre-wash to drying, relies on this board. Think of it as the director of an orchestra. Each instrument plays its part when the director signals it.

When the control board fails, your dishwasher may exhibit various symptoms. Cycles might not complete. Buttons may not respond. Error codes could appear on the display. These are signs that the "brain" of your appliance is unwell. Diagnosing these issues correctly saves time and money.

A common sign of a faulty board is erratic behavior. Your dishwasher might start a cycle, then stop mid-way. It might fill with water but not wash. Sometimes, the display remains blank or shows garbled text. These behaviors often indicate power delivery issues or internal circuit damage on the board itself. Identifying these symptoms early helps you narrow down the problem.

Older control boards use relays and basic circuits. Newer ones often incorporate microprocessors. Both types can fail due to power surges, water damage, or old age. Knowing what to look for helps in effective troubleshooting. My own experience with appliance repair showed me that control board problems are surprisingly common.

## Safety First: Preparing for Dishwasher Testing

Safety is paramount before you begin any appliance repair. Working with electricity poses risks. You must take steps to protect yourself. Ignoring safety can lead to electric shock or serious injury. I always emphasize this rule.

First, disconnect power to the dishwasher. Locate your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position. If labels are unclear, flip the main breaker for your entire home. Confirm the power is off by trying to turn the dishwasher on. No lights or sounds mean it is safe.

Next, gather your tools. You will need a Phillips head screwdriver and a flathead screwdriver. A nut driver set may also be helpful. The most crucial tool is a multimeter. It measures voltage, resistance, and continuity. Ensure your multimeter has fresh batteries and works correctly.

Wear protective gloves, especially if handling old wiring or sharp edges. Work in a well-lit area. Clear any clutter around the dishwasher. You need room to maneuver. Taking these precautions ensures a safe and productive repair session. This step sets the stage for accurate diagnosis.

## Accessing the Control Board in Your Whirlpool Dishwasher

Accessing the control board varies by Whirlpool dishwasher model. Most models place the control board in one of two main locations. It is either behind the toe kick panel at the bottom or behind the main control panel at the top of the door. Knowing your model helps determine the exact location. Always consult your owner's manual for specific instructions.

For models with the control board at the bottom:
1.  Open the dishwasher door.
2.  Locate the two or three screws securing the toe kick panel. This panel runs along the bottom front.
3.  Remove these screws using a Phillips head screwdriver.
4.  Carefully pull the toe kick panel away. The control board often sits in a plastic housing behind it.
5.  You might need to remove another set of screws to open this housing.

For models with the control board behind the door panel (common for top-control models):
1.  Open the dishwasher door fully.
2.  Look along the inner edge of the door panel for screws. These screws secure the inner panel to the outer panel.
3.  Remove all screws around the perimeter of the inner door panel. Keep them organized.
4.  Carefully separate the inner door panel from the outer panel. The control panel, along with the main control board, will be attached to the outer panel.
5.  Support the outer panel as you disconnect wiring harnesses from the control board. Be gentle with the wires and connectors.

Once you gain access, the control board will be visible. It is usually a rectangular circuit board with various wire connectors plugged into it. Take a picture of the wiring before disconnecting anything. This helps with reassembly. Make sure all connections are clearly visible for inspection.

## Visual Inspection and Basic Checks

Before reaching for your multimeter, perform a thorough visual inspection. Many control board issues are obvious. This step is quick and can save you time. A careful look can reveal a clear problem.

First, check for any visible burn marks on the board. Overheating can cause components to scorch or melt. Look for discolored areas, especially around resistors or capacitors. These components regulate current flow. A black or brown spot usually indicates a short circuit or overload.

Next, inspect for signs of water damage. Water and electronics do not mix. Look for corrosion, rust, or mineral deposits on the board's surface. These can bridge circuits and cause malfunctions. Water leaks from the dishwasher can sometimes splash onto the control board. Even old water stains can indicate past problems.

Examine the wire harnesses connected to the control board. Ensure all connectors are firmly seated. Loose connections can mimic control board failures. Gently tug on each wire to confirm it is secure. Look for any frayed or broken wires. A damaged wire prevents proper communication with the board.

Check the board for bulging or leaking capacitors. Capacitors are small, cylindrical components. When they fail, their tops can bulge outwards or leak fluid. This is a clear sign of a defective capacitor, which can disable the entire board. This visual check often provides immediate answers.

## Using a Multimeter to Test Control Board Components

A multimeter is essential for diagnosing the control board. It measures electrical properties. You can test continuity, voltage, and resistance. These tests help determine if the board receives power or if its internal circuits are broken. Always handle the multimeter probes carefully.

First, set your multimeter to the voltage (V) setting, typically DCV if checking board output to components, or ACV if checking incoming power. With the dishwasher power still off, connect the multimeter leads to the power input terminals of the control board. Turn the power back on *briefly* to check for the correct incoming voltage (usually 120V AC). If the voltage is absent or low, the problem is not the control board but the power supply to it. For general guidance on testing appliance control boards, you can refer to how to test an [electric oven control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-electric-oven-control-board), as many principles apply.

Next, disconnect the power again. Set your multimeter to the continuity setting (often indicated by a speaker icon). This setting checks if a circuit is complete. Touch the probes to two points on a circuit path you suspect is open. If the multimeter beeps or shows a low resistance reading, there is continuity. No beep or an "OL" (over limit) reading indicates an open circuit. This suggests a break in the path. This test is useful for checking fuses or specific traces on the board. Similar principles apply when you [test LG dishwasher control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-lg-dishwasher-control-board) components for functionality.

You can also test for resistance (Ohms, Î©) on individual components if you suspect specific parts. However, this often requires advanced knowledge of circuit diagrams. For most users, checking input voltage and continuity on clearly marked paths is sufficient. Remember to always have the power off when checking continuity or resistance. This prevents damage to your multimeter. These electrical checks provide concrete evidence of a healthy or faulty board.

## Troubleshooting Common Whirlpool Dishwasher Control Board Symptoms

Different symptoms can point to a faulty Whirlpool dishwasher control board. Understanding these signs helps confirm your diagnosis. Knowing what to look for makes troubleshooting more efficient. It ensures you address the correct problem.

A common symptom is the dishwasher not starting at all. You press the start button, but nothing happens. No lights, no sounds. This indicates the control board is not receiving power. It might also mean the board cannot process the start command. Check power supply first. Then, look for a blown fuse on the control board itself. Sometimes, a reset can fix minor glitches. If the board remains unresponsive, it likely needs replacement.

Another frequent issue is incorrect cycle behavior. The dishwasher might get stuck in a wash cycle. It might skip parts of the cycle, like draining or rinsing. This suggests that the control board is not correctly advancing through the program. The internal programming or relays on the board might be failing. For example, if your [Whirlpool oven control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-whirlpool-oven-control-board) had similar issues, you would follow comparable diagnostic steps. The logic is often consistent across appliance types.

Error codes on the display are often direct indicators of control board problems. Each error code points to a specific component or system failure. Sometimes, the code indicates a problem with the sensor or pump. Other times, the control board itself is reporting an internal error. Refer to your dishwasher's manual for specific error code definitions. If multiple, seemingly unrelated error codes appear, the control board is highly suspect. This indicates a general communication failure or a broad system malfunction.

## Deciding Between Repair or Replacement

Once you confirm the control board is faulty, you face a decision. Should you attempt a repair, or is replacement the better option? This choice depends on several factors. Consider the severity of the damage and your technical skills.

If the visual inspection reveals minor damage, such as a loose wire or a slightly corroded terminal, a repair might be feasible. You could clean the corrosion or re-solder a loose connection. However, internal circuit damage, like a burnt trace or a failed microprocessor, is often beyond basic repair. These issues require specialized tools and advanced electronics knowledge. My advice is simple: if you are not comfortable with soldering tiny components, replacement is safer.

The cost of a new Whirlpool dishwasher control board is a major factor. Prices vary widely. Get a quote for a new board before deciding. Compare this cost to the price of a brand-new dishwasher. If the control board is very expensive, and your dishwasher is old, replacement of the entire appliance might be more economical. A new dishwasher offers a warranty and improved efficiency. Replacing a control board is often easier than tackling major mechanical components. For insights into general replacement procedures, consider how to [replace a GE dishwasher control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-ge-dishwasher-control-board) or how to [replace a KitchenAid dishwasher control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-kitchenaid-dishwasher-control-board), as the process can share similarities in terms of dismounting and remounting the board.

Consider the age of your dishwasher. If your Whirlpool dishwasher is nearing the end of its typical lifespan (usually 10-12 years), investing in a major repair might not be wise. The control board might be fixed, but other components could fail soon. However, if your dishwasher is relatively new, replacing the control board is often the most cost-effective solution. This extends the life of a valuable appliance. Make an informed decision based on your specific situation.
