## Master Your Scrunchies: A Guide to Cleaning Hair Accessories

Do your favorite scrunchies feel a littleâ€¦less than fresh? I know the feeling. Scrunchies are essential hair accessories for many of us, but they gather dirt, oils, and product buildup over time. Cleaning scrunchies regularly is not just about hygiene; it helps maintain their elasticity and extends their life. A clean scrunchie feels better in your hair and lasts longer.

This comprehensive guide will show you exactly how to clean scrunchies of different materials. We will cover everything from basic hand washing to machine washing tips. You will also learn how to dry them properly and tackle common issues. Get ready to refresh your entire scrunchie collection!

### Takeaway

Keeping your scrunchies clean preserves their look and function. Here is the key takeaway:

*   **Assess Material:** Choose cleaning method based on scrunchie fabric (e.g., delicate hand wash for silk, machine wash for cotton).
*   **Use Gentle Products:** Mild detergent is best for all scrunchies.
*   **Dry Properly:** Air dry to maintain shape and elasticity.

To clean scrunchies, you should first identify the fabric. Most can be gently hand washed with mild soap and cool water, then air-dried. Durable materials like cotton can often be machine washed in a mesh bag on a delicate cycle. Always avoid harsh chemicals to protect the fabric and elastic.

## Why Your Scrunchies Need Regular Cleaning

Scrunchies are lovely hair accessories. We wear them almost every day. They hold our hair in place. However, scrunchies pick up many things from our hair and surroundings. These include natural oils from your scalp, styling products like hairspray or gel, and even dust from the air.

Over time, this buildup makes your scrunchies feel greasy and look dull. It can also cause them to lose their vibrant color. A dirty scrunchie can even transfer grime back to your clean hair. This defeats the purpose of washing your hair. Keeping your scrunchies clean ensures they are always ready to use. It makes them a fresh addition to your hairstyle.

Regular cleaning prevents unpleasant odors. The combination of sweat, oils, and dirt can create a stale smell. This smell can cling to the fabric. Nobody wants their hair to smell like a dirty scrunchie. A consistent cleaning routine keeps your scrunchies smelling fresh. It also helps them feel soft and comfortable.

Think about how often you touch your scrunchies. You pull them on and off your wrist or through your hair. This means they accumulate germs from your hands and environment. Washing them removes these unwanted particles. This promotes better hygiene for your hair and skin. It makes wearing your scrunchies a more pleasant experience.

Finally, proper care helps maintain the scrunchie's structure. The elastic inside can weaken if exposed to constant dirt and product buildup. Cleaning helps preserve the elastic's stretchiness. It also keeps the fabric soft and less prone to damage. This means your favorite scrunchies will last much longer. Regular washing is a simple way to extend the life of your entire collection.

## Pre-Cleaning Steps for Your Scrunchies

Before you start washing your scrunchies, a few simple steps prepare them for cleaning. This preparation ensures a more effective and gentle wash. It also helps protect the scrunchies from any potential damage during the process. I always take these preliminary steps.

First, sort your scrunchies by material. Different fabrics require different care methods. Silk, satin, and velvet scrunchies are delicate. They need more gentle handling. Cotton or thicker synthetic scrunchies are often more durable. They can withstand a more robust wash. Separating them prevents damage to delicate items. It ensures each type receives the right treatment.

Next, check for any obvious debris or loose hairs. Gently pull out any strands of hair tangled in the fabric. You can use your fingers or a lint roller for this. Removing large pieces of dirt or hair makes the actual washing process easier. It also prevents these items from clogging your drain if you are hand washing.

Inspect your scrunchies for stains. If you see specific spots, you might need to pre-treat them. For most fabric scrunchies, a small drop of mild liquid detergent or a gentle stain remover can work wonders. Apply the treatment directly to the stain. Gently rub it with your finger or a soft brush. Let it sit for a few minutes before washing. This helps lift the stain more effectively.

Consider the color of your scrunchies. Just like with clothes, dark colors can bleed onto lighter ones. If you have brightly colored or dark scrunchies, wash them separately. Alternatively, wash them with similar colors. This prevents color transfer. It keeps your scrunchies looking new and vibrant.

Finally, if you plan to machine wash, gather your mesh laundry bags. Placing scrunchies in a mesh bag protects them during the wash cycle. It prevents the elastic from getting tangled or stretched. It also keeps small scrunchies from getting lost in the washing machine. This simple step adds an extra layer of protection.

## Hand Washing Scrunchies: A Gentle Approach

Hand washing is often the best method for cleaning scrunchies. It is gentle on delicate fabrics like silk, satin, or velvet. This method also helps preserve the elastic inside. I use hand washing for my favorite and most expensive scrunchies. It gives me control over the cleaning process.

First, gather your supplies. You will need a clean basin or sink, cool or lukewarm water, and a mild detergent. Baby shampoo or a delicate fabric wash works perfectly. Avoid harsh soaps or strong detergents. These can damage the fabric fibers or elastic. You can also use a small amount of distilled white vinegar for odor removal, similar to how one might use [vinegar to clean a shower](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shower-with-vinegar).

Fill your basin with cool or lukewarm water. Add a tiny amount of your chosen mild detergent. Swirl the water gently to mix the soap. The water should be slightly sudsy, but not overly bubbly. Too much soap can be hard to rinse out.

Submerge your scrunchies into the soapy water. Gently knead them with your hands. This helps the water and soap penetrate the fabric. Focus on areas that seem dirtiest. Avoid harsh scrubbing or twisting. This can stretch out the elastic or damage the fabric. Let them soak for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the soap to break down oils and dirt.

After soaking, drain the soapy water. Rinse each scrunchie thoroughly under cool, running water. Squeeze gently to remove excess water. Keep rinsing until all the soap suds are gone. You want the water running clear from the scrunchie. Any leftover soap can leave residue on the fabric.

Once rinsed, gently press excess water from each scrunchie. Do not wring them out forcefully. This can damage the elastic. Lay them flat on a clean towel. Roll the towel up with the scrunchies inside. Press down to absorb more water. This prepares them for air drying. Hand washing is a small effort for long-lasting, beautiful scrunchies.

## Machine Washing Scrunchies: For Durability

Machine washing can be a convenient option for cleaning scrunchies made from more durable materials. This includes cotton, linen, or sturdy synthetic blends. While hand washing is generally safer, the machine method is quicker for a large collection. I often machine wash my everyday cotton scrunchies. It saves time.

Before placing scrunchies in the washing machine, prepare them properly. The most crucial step is to use a mesh laundry bag. Place all your scrunchies inside the bag. This protects them from getting tangled around the machine's agitator. It also prevents the elastic from stretching out. Small items like scrunchies can easily get lost in the wash. A mesh bag keeps them contained and safe. This protective measure is similar to how you might protect other small items, such as [cleaning shoes in the washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer), by using a laundry bag.

Select the right wash cycle. Choose a delicate or gentle cycle. Use cold water. Hot water can cause certain fabrics to shrink or colors to fade. Cold water is effective for cleaning most scrunchies. It is also gentler on the elastic. A gentle cycle minimizes agitation. This protects the scrunchies from harsh movements.

Use a mild detergent. Just like with hand washing, harsh chemicals can damage scrunchie fabric and elasticity. A small amount of liquid laundry detergent designed for delicate items is ideal. Avoid using bleach unless the scrunchie is pure white and the fabric is bleach-safe. Bleach can weaken fibers and cause discoloration.

Avoid washing scrunchies with heavy items like towels or jeans. The weight and friction from these items can damage delicate scrunchies. Wash them with other lightweight items, or even a load of delicates. This ensures they do not get crushed or stretched.

Once the cycle is complete, promptly remove the scrunchies from the mesh bag. Do not leave them in the machine. This can lead to mildew growth if they remain damp. Proceed to air dry them. Machine washing can be efficient when done correctly. It helps keep your durable scrunchies clean and ready for use.

## Cleaning Specific Scrunchie Materials

Not all scrunchies are created equal when it comes to cleaning. Different fabrics require specific care. Understanding these differences protects your scrunchies. It ensures they stay beautiful for a long time. I pay close attention to material type for this reason.

### Silk and Satin Scrunchies

Silk and satin scrunchies are luxurious. They are also very delicate. Always hand wash these materials. Use cool water and a tiny amount of mild, pH-neutral detergent. Baby shampoo works well. Gently swirl the scrunchie in the soapy water for a minute or two. Do not scrub or wring. Rinse thoroughly under cool running water until all soap is gone. Press out excess water with a clean towel. Lay flat or hang to air dry. Direct sunlight can damage silk, so avoid it.

### Velvet Scrunchies

Velvet scrunchies have a plush texture. They need careful handling to avoid crushing the pile. Hand washing is the preferred method for velvet. Use cool water and a very small amount of mild liquid soap. Gently dab and squeeze the scrunchie in the soapy water. Avoid rubbing, as this can flatten the velvet pile. Rinse well under cool water. Gently press out excess water with a towel. Do not wring. Hang or lay flat to air dry. Use a soft brush to gently fluff the pile once dry, if needed.

### Cotton and Linen Scrunchies

Cotton and linen scrunchies are sturdy. They are typically the easiest to clean. You can hand wash them or machine wash them. If machine washing, always use a mesh laundry bag. Choose a delicate cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. These fabrics are more forgiving. However, avoid hot water to prevent shrinkage and color fading. Air dry to maintain shape. These materials can often withstand more general cleaning products, but always check for colorfastness. For common cleaning issues like stains on different materials, consider techniques used for [cleaning stains off walls](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-off-walls), applying gentle stain removal principles.

### Other Materials (e.g., Chiffon, Rayon, Faux Fur)

For scrunchies made from other delicate synthetic fabrics like chiffon or rayon, hand washing is usually the safest bet. Follow the same steps as for silk. Use cool water and mild soap. For faux fur scrunchies, hand washing is also best. Spot clean if possible. If a full wash is needed, use cool water and a gentle cleanser. Rinse carefully. Air dry only, and never put faux fur in a dryer. The heat can damage the fibers. Always read any care tags on your scrunchies if they have them.

## Drying and Storing Clean Scrunchies

Proper drying and storage are just as important as washing. These steps ensure your scrunchies maintain their shape, elasticity, and freshness. Incorrect drying can ruin a scrunchie. I am very particular about how I dry my scrunchies.

After washing, gently squeeze excess water from each scrunchie. Do not twist or wring them aggressively. This can stretch out the elastic or damage the fabric. For delicate materials, roll them in a clean, dry towel and gently press to absorb more moisture. This removes much of the water without stress.

Air drying is almost always the best method for scrunchies. Avoid using a machine dryer. The heat from a dryer can cause the elastic to weaken or break. It can also shrink certain fabrics or damage delicate ones like silk or velvet. High heat is a scrunchie's worst enemy.

To air dry, you have a few options. You can lay scrunchies flat on a clean, dry towel. Make sure they are not overlapping to allow for good airflow. Another method is to hang them. You can use a clothing line, a drying rack, or even clip them onto a hanger. Ensure they are not stretched while hanging. Hanging them over a thin dowel or a chopstick works well. This allows the air to circulate evenly around the entire scrunchie.

Choose a well-ventilated area for drying. A spot with good air circulation helps them dry faster and prevents mildew. Avoid direct sunlight for silk or brightly colored scrunchies. Sunlight can fade colors and weaken delicate fibers over time. Allow scrunchies to dry completely before storing them. Even slight dampness can lead to mold or a musty smell.

Once fully dry, store your clean scrunchies properly. Keep them in a clean, dry place. A dedicated drawer, a decorative basket, or a clear container works well. Avoid storing them in humid environments like bathrooms. Humidity can encourage mold growth. Proper storage keeps them organized. It also prevents them from collecting dust between uses. This extends their freshness and readiness.

## Troubleshooting Common Scrunchie Cleaning Issues

Even with the best cleaning practices, you might encounter a few common issues. These problems are usually easy to fix. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps you keep your scrunchies in top condition. I have dealt with these issues many times.

### Dealing with Stubborn Stains

Sometimes, a scrunchie might have a stubborn stain. This could be from makeup, food, or something else. For oil-based stains, a small amount of dish soap can work wonders. Apply a tiny drop directly to the stain. Gently rub it in with your finger or a soft brush. Let it sit for a few minutes before hand washing. For other types of stains, a mild laundry pre-treatment spray might be effective. Always test stain removers on a hidden area first. This ensures it does not damage the fabric or color. If the stain is from mold, consider using a vinegar solution, similar to how one might [clean mold with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar).

### Removing Odors

Scrunchies can develop an unpleasant odor from sweat or hair products. If regular washing does not remove the smell, try a vinegar soak. Add about a quarter cup of white vinegar to a basin of cool water. Soak your scrunchies for 30 minutes. The vinegar neutralizes odors. After soaking, rinse them thoroughly with cool water. Then wash them as usual with mild detergent. Air dry completely. Baking soda can also absorb odors. Sprinkle dry baking soda on a dry scrunchie. Let it sit for a few hours, then shake it off.

### Restoring Elasticity

Over time, the elastic inside a scrunchie can lose its stretch. This often happens from repeated use or improper drying. Unfortunately, it is difficult to fully restore stretched-out elastic. However, gentle washing and proper air drying can help preserve the remaining elasticity. Avoid hot water and machine drying. These actions speed up elastic degradation. If the elastic is completely gone, it might be time to replace the scrunchie. Some crafty individuals can open the scrunchie, replace the elastic, and sew it back up.

### Preventing Shrinkage

Shrinkage is a common problem with certain fabrics, especially cotton or rayon, if exposed to high heat. Always use cold or lukewarm water for washing scrunchies. Never put them in a machine dryer. The intense heat of a dryer is the primary cause of shrinkage. Air dry all scrunchies. If a scrunchie has already shrunk slightly, you can try to gently stretch it back into shape while it is still damp. Do this carefully to avoid tearing the fabric. Consistent gentle care is key to preventing shrinkage.

### Fading Colors

Brightly colored scrunchies can fade over time. This happens due to sunlight exposure, harsh detergents, or hot water. To prevent fading, wash scrunchies with cold water and mild, color-safe detergents. Avoid direct sunlight when air drying. Store them out of direct light. Washing dark and bright colors separately also helps. This prevents dye transfer and keeps colors vibrant.

## Maintaining Scrunchie Freshness Between Washes

Cleaning scrunchies is essential, but you can do things to keep them fresh between washes. These simple habits reduce the need for frequent deep cleaning. They also extend the life of your scrunchies. I try to follow these tips daily.

First, rotate your scrunchies. Do not wear the same scrunchie every day. Giving them a break allows them to air out. This helps dissipate any accumulated moisture or minor odors. Having a collection means you can easily switch them out. This prevents excessive buildup on a single scrunchie.

Store your scrunchies in a clean, open space. Avoid throwing them into a cluttered drawer or a closed bag right after wearing them. An open basket or a scrunchie holder allows air to circulate around them. This helps them dry out naturally. Good airflow prevents musty smells and mildew formation. It keeps them feeling fresh.

Avoid placing dirty scrunchies on unwashed surfaces. When you take a scrunchie out of your hair, do not just toss it onto your bed or a dirty table. Place it on a clean surface or directly into your laundry basket. This prevents it from picking up more dirt or germs. It also keeps your living space cleaner.

Be mindful of hair product residue. Hairspray, gel, and styling creams can build up on scrunchies. If you use a lot of product, consider waiting for your hair to dry completely. This might lessen the transfer of sticky residue to the scrunchie
