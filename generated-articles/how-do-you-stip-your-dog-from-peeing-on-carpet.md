## Stop Your Dog From Peeing On Carpet: A Complete Guide

Discovering a puddle of urine on your soft carpet can feel frustrating. It is a common problem many dog owners face. This issue often signals an underlying cause or a gap in training. You want your home to stay clean and fresh, not smell like a kennel. Dealing with dog urine on carpet takes patience and the right approach.

This guide will help you stop your dog from peeing on carpet. We will explore common reasons for these accidents. We will also provide clear steps for effective house training. You will learn how to manage behavioral issues. We will also cover essential cleaning methods. My goal is to help you create a harmonious, clean home for you and your dog.

### Takeaway

*   Identify the root cause: rule out medical issues first.
*   Establish a consistent potty training schedule.
*   Supervise your dog closely, especially indoors.
*   Clean all accidents thoroughly with enzymatic cleaners.
*   Seek professional help if problems continue.

To stop your dog from peeing on carpet, identify the cause, which can be medical or behavioral. Implement a consistent potty training schedule, including frequent outdoor breaks and positive reinforcement. Always clean accidents completely using enzyme-based cleaners to eliminate odor and discourage repeat marking.

## Understanding Why Dogs Pee On Carpet

Dogs do not pee on carpets to annoy you. There is always a reason behind this behavior. Understanding these reasons helps you find the right solution. It is the first step in stopping accidents. I have learned that looking for the "why" makes the process smoother.

### Medical Reasons for Carpet Accidents

Sometimes, a dog peeing on carpet signals a health problem. This is a very common cause. Dogs cannot tell you they feel sick. Increased urination or loss of bladder control can be symptoms.

*   **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** A UTI causes pain and a strong urge to urinate. Your dog may need to go more often. Accidents happen because they cannot hold it.
*   **Diabetes:** Dogs with diabetes drink more water. They also urinate more frequently. This makes accidents more likely, even for well-trained dogs.
*   **Kidney Disease:** Impaired kidney function affects how your dog processes water. This can lead to increased thirst and urination.
*   **Bladder Stones:** These can irritate the bladder. They also block the flow of urine. Both conditions cause discomfort and frequent urination.
*   **Cushing's Disease:** This hormonal disorder leads to excessive thirst and urination. It is more common in older dogs.
*   **Incontinence:** Older dogs, especially spayed females, may develop incontinence. Their bladder muscles weaken. They may leak urine, especially when sleeping.

If your dog suddenly starts having accidents, a vet visit is crucial. Rule out any medical conditions first. This ensures you address the core issue. Ignoring medical signs can worsen your dog's health.

### Behavioral Issues Leading to Indoor Urination

If your vet clears your dog of medical problems, the cause is likely behavioral. Dogs communicate through actions. Peeing inside can be a sign of stress, anxiety, or confusion.

*   **Separation Anxiety:** Dogs with separation anxiety get very stressed when alone. They may urinate indoors as a coping mechanism. This is not defiance. It is a panic response.
*   **Excitement Urination:** Some dogs pee a little when they get very excited. This often happens during greetings or play. It is more common in puppies but can affect adults.
*   **Submissive Urination:** A dog may urinate when feeling intimidated or submissive. This happens during scolding or when meeting new people. They show they are not a threat.
*   **Territorial Marking:** Intact male dogs often mark their territory with urine. Females can also mark. They leave small amounts to claim an area.
*   **Attention Seeking:** Sometimes, a dog learns that peeing indoors gets your attention. Even negative attention is still attention. They may repeat the behavior.
*   **Fear and Phobias:** Loud noises or new environments can scare a dog. They might urinate out of fear. This is an involuntary reaction.

Understanding these behaviors helps you respond appropriately. Punishment often makes behavioral issues worse. A calm, consistent approach works better.

### Incomplete Potty Training or Regression

Many indoor accidents trace back to training gaps. Puppies need clear, consistent training. Older dogs can sometimes regress. This means they forget their training or stop following it.

*   **Lack of Consistency:** House training needs a strict schedule. Missing potty breaks or varied routines confuse a dog. They do not know when or where to go.
*   **Not Fully House-trained:** Some dogs are rushed through training. They may seem house-trained but still have accidents. They need more reinforcement.
*   **Changes in Routine:** Moving homes or a new family member can disrupt a dog's routine. This stress can lead to accidents. They need time to adjust.
*   **Poor Previous Training:** Dogs adopted from shelters might have inconsistent past training. They need a fresh start with clear rules.
*   **Learning Opportunity Missed:** If you do not catch your dog in the act, they do not connect peeing inside with disapproval. They learn nothing from it.

Regression happens sometimes. A previously house-trained dog starts having accidents. This requires going back to basics. Treat them like a puppy again. Re-establish routines. My own dog had a regression phase. We went back to square one, and it worked wonders.

## Foundation of Potty Training and Housebreaking

A strong house training foundation is critical. It sets your dog up for success. This involves clear rules and positive reinforcement. This process requires patience. It builds good habits.

### Establishing a Consistent Potty Schedule

Consistency is the most important part of potty training. Dogs thrive on routine. They learn when and where to relieve themselves. I always tell new puppy owners to make a schedule.

*   **Frequent Potty Breaks:** Young puppies need to go out every 1-2 hours. Adult dogs need breaks every 4-6 hours. Take them out first thing in the morning. Take them out last thing at night. Take them out after waking up from naps. Take them out after playing. Take them out after eating and drinking.
*   **Designated Potty Spot:** Always take your dog to the same spot. The scent helps them understand its purpose. This reinforces the idea that this is their toilet area.
*   **Wait and Reward:** Wait for your dog to eliminate. As soon as they finish, praise them. Give them a small, high-value treat. This positive reinforcement connects going outside with good things. Make it exciting for them!

A consistent schedule teaches your dog to hold it. It also teaches them to signal when they need to go. This predictability reduces anxiety. It also reduces accidents.

### Using Crate Training Effectively

Crate training is a powerful house-training tool. Dogs instinctively avoid soiling their den. A crate leverages this natural instinct. It helps them learn bladder control.

*   **Proper Crate Size:** The crate must be just large enough for your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If it is too big, they may use one end as a bathroom.
*   **Positive Association:** Make the crate a happy place. Put toys and comfy bedding inside. Feed meals in the crate. Never use the crate as punishment.
*   **Gradual Introduction:** Introduce the crate slowly. Allow your dog to explore it. Close the door for short periods at first. Increase time gradually.
*   **Not for Punishment:** The crate should be a safe den. Punishing your dog by putting them in the crate creates fear. This defeats the purpose of crate training.

A crate helps when you cannot supervise your dog. It prevents accidents. It teaches them to hold their bladder until they are released outside. Remember, a crate is a short-term confinement solution, not a long-term living space.

### The Power of Positive Reinforcement

Positive reinforcement makes training enjoyable for both of you. It builds trust. It makes your dog want to learn. This method focuses on rewarding good behavior.

*   **Immediate Rewards:** Praise and treats must be given immediately. Your dog needs to connect the reward with the action. Timing is everything.
*   **High-Value Treats:** Use treats your dog loves. Small pieces of cheese or cooked chicken work well. These are more motivating than regular kibble.
*   **Verbal Praise:** Use happy, encouraging words. Say "Good potty!" or "Yes!" in a cheerful tone. Your enthusiasm encourages them.
*   **Avoid Punishment:** Punishment for accidents teaches fear, not proper behavior. Your dog learns to hide their accidents. They may become afraid to pee in front of you. This makes training harder.

Positive reinforcement creates a dog that wants to please you. They learn that going outside brings good things. This method is much more effective than punishment.

### Supervise and Interrupt Accidents

Active supervision prevents accidents. It also helps you catch your dog in the act. This allows for immediate redirection. You can use a leash inside the house.

*   **Watch for Signals:** Learn your dog's pre-potty signals. These include sniffing around, circling, or suddenly walking away. These signs tell you they need to go out.
*   **Interrupt Gently:** If you see your dog starting to pee indoors, interrupt them. A sudden clap or a firm "Outside!" works. Do not yell or scare them.
*   **Immediately Take Outside:** Scoop your dog up or quickly leash them. Rush them to their designated potty spot. Stay with them until they finish.
*   **Praise and Reward Outdoors:** If they finish peeing outside after the interruption, praise them heavily. Give them a treat. This teaches them the correct place.

Supervision is your best defense against indoor accidents. It gives you the chance to teach them correctly. It prevents repeated mistakes.

## Effective Strategies to Stop Accidents

Stopping accidents requires a multi-faceted approach. You need to combine training with environmental management. These strategies help reinforce good habits. They also minimize opportunities for mistakes.

### Supervise Closely When Indoors

Close supervision is key to preventing accidents. This is especially true during the house-training phase. Your dog cannot make mistakes if you are watching them.

*   **Leash Your Dog:** Keep your dog on a leash while indoors. Attach the leash to your belt. This keeps them close. You will notice immediately if they start to squat.
*   **Designated Play Areas:** Limit your dog to one room or a gated area. Choose a space that is easy to clean. This reduces the area where accidents can happen.
*   **Interactive Play:** Play with your dog often. This tires them out. It also keeps their mind engaged. A tired dog is less likely to have accidents.
*   **Regular Check-ins:** Even when confined, check on them frequently. Look for signs they need to go out. This ensures you catch them before an accident.

Constant supervision prevents your dog from forming bad habits. It allows you to intervene immediately. It helps you teach them the right way. This strategy directly helps [how to keep dogs from peeing on furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-dogs-from-peeing-on-furniture) and [how to make my dog stop peeing on the couch](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-my-dog-stop-peeing-on-the-couch) as well.

### Interrupt and Redirect Appropriately

If you catch your dog peeing on the carpet, act quickly. Your response shapes their learning. A calm, immediate redirection is vital.

*   **Catch in the Act:** This is the only time you can effectively correct. Do not scold for old accidents. Your dog will not understand.
*   **Use a Noise:** A sharp "Ah-ah!" or a clap can interrupt them. Do not yell or frighten them. The goal is to stop the action.
*   **Rush Outside:** Immediately take your dog to their designated potty spot. Carry smaller dogs if needed. This reinforces the correct location.
*   **Praise and Reward Outdoors:** If your dog finishes peeing outside, praise them enthusiastically. Give a high-value treat. This positive outcome strengthens the right behavior.

Interrupting and redirecting teaches your dog in the moment. It shows them where they *should* go. This makes the learning process clear. It also helps [how to keep dogs from peeing on rugs](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-dogs-from-peeing-on-rugs).

### Ensure Regular Potty Breaks

Frequency is key to successful house training. Your dog needs consistent opportunities to relieve themselves. Their bladder capacity is limited.

*   **Puppies:** Take young puppies out every 1-2 hours. They have small bladders. They need frequent opportunities.
*   **Adult Dogs:** Adult dogs need breaks every 4-6 hours. This includes first thing in the morning and last thing at night.
*   **After Key Events:** Always take your dog out after waking up, eating, drinking, and playing. These activities stimulate the bladder and bowels.
*   **Before Crate Time:** Ensure your dog has emptied their bladder completely before crating them. This prevents accidents in the crate.

Regular potty breaks prevent accidents before they happen. They build a reliable routine. Your dog learns to expect these opportunities.

### Designate a Specific Potty Area

Having a consistent outdoor spot helps your dog understand where to go. Dogs use scent cues. The smell of their own urine reinforces the "potty spot."

*   **Choose a Spot:** Select an area in your yard. Make sure it is easy to access. Keep it clean.
*   **Always Go There:** Always lead your dog to this exact spot. Be patient and wait for them to go.
*   **Clean Up:** Pick up waste immediately. This keeps the area sanitary. It also makes the spot appealing to your dog.
*   **Consistency:** Do not change the spot unless absolutely necessary. This consistency helps your dog learn faster.

A designated potty area removes confusion. Your dog learns that this particular spot is where they can relieve themselves. This streamlines the training process.

### Reward Good Behavior Consistently

Positive reinforcement is the most powerful training tool. It creates a happy, motivated dog. They want to repeat behaviors that earn rewards.

*   **Verbal Praise:** Use a cheerful, happy tone. Say "Good dog!" or "Potty time!" when they go outside.
*   **Treats:** Offer a high-value treat immediately after they finish. Make it a treat they love. This reinforces the connection.
*   **Play Time:** Follow successful potty trips with a short play session. This makes going outside even more rewarding.
*   **No Punishment for Accidents:** Never punish your dog for accidents. It teaches fear. It damages your bond. It makes them hide accidents.

Rewarding good behavior reinforces the actions you want. Your dog learns that peeing outside brings positive outcomes. This builds confidence and trust.

## Addressing Behavioral Causes

Behavioral issues require specific attention. You need to understand the root cause. Then, you can address it effectively. This often involves reducing stress or changing routines.

### Managing Separation Anxiety

Separation anxiety causes intense distress when a dog is left alone. Urinating indoors is a symptom. It is a panic response.

*   **Gradual Departures:** Start with short absences. Leave for a few minutes. Come back before anxiety builds. Gradually increase the time.
*   **Provide Distractions:** Give your dog a puzzle toy filled with treats before you leave. This keeps them busy. It associates your departure with good things.
*   **Create a Safe Space:** Make a cozy, safe area for your dog. A crate or a dog bed in a quiet room can help.
*   **Consult a Professional:** For severe cases, seek a certified dog behaviorist. They can provide tailored strategies. Medication might be necessary in some situations.

Managing separation anxiety reduces stress. This can stop stress-related accidents. It helps your dog feel secure when you are gone.

### Reducing Submissive Urination

Submissive urination is an involuntary response. It happens when a dog feels threatened or overwhelmed. It is not defiance.

*   **Avoid Harsh Discipline:** Never scold a dog for submissive peeing. This makes the problem worse. It increases their fear.
*   **Low-Key Greetings:** When you greet your dog, keep it calm. Avoid direct eye contact. Do not lean over them. Kneel down instead.
*   **Ignore for a Moment:** When you first come home, ignore your dog for a minute or two. Let them calm down. Then, greet them gently.
*   **Build Confidence:** Enroll in obedience classes. Teach them new tricks. Positive training builds confidence. This reduces submissive behaviors.

Addressing submissive urination helps your dog feel safe. It prevents involuntary accidents. It fosters a trusting relationship.

### Calming Excitement Peeing

Excitement urination is also involuntary. It happens when a dog gets overly excited. This is common in puppies.

*   **Calm Greetings:** Ask visitors to ignore your dog at first. Once your dog calms down, they can greet them gently.
*   **Before Play/Guests:** Take your dog outside to pee right before exciting events. This empties their bladder.
*   **Avoid Over-Excitement:** Keep interactions calm. Do not engage in overly stimulating play indoors if this triggers peeing.
*   **Maturity:** Puppies often outgrow excitement urination. Consistent training and patience help them learn bladder control.

Calming excited greetings helps control this reflex. It teaches your dog to manage their excitement without accidents.

### Neutering or Spaying for Marking Behavior

Intact dogs, especially males, often mark territory. This is a natural instinct. Spaying or neutering can reduce this behavior.

*   **Reduces Hormones:** Spaying or neutering removes the hormones that drive marking. This makes them less likely to mark.
*   **Not a Guaranteed Fix:** While often effective, it is not always a complete solution. Some dogs may continue marking out of habit.
*   **Combination Approach:** Combine surgery with training. Clean all marked areas thoroughly. Use enzyme cleaners to eliminate odors.

Consider spaying or neutering your dog if marking is a problem. Discuss this option with your vet. It can greatly reduce marking behaviors.

### Environmental Enrichment and Exercise

A bored or under-exercised dog can develop behavioral issues. This includes inappropriate urination. They need outlets for their energy.

*   **Daily Exercise:** Ensure your dog gets enough physical activity. Walks, runs, and playtime burn energy. A tired dog is a well-behaved dog.
*   **Mental Stimulation:** Use puzzle toys. Teach new tricks. Engage in interactive games. Mental exercise is as important as physical exercise.
*   **Structured Play:** Play fetch or tug-of-war. These activities provide a healthy outlet. They also strengthen your bond.
*   **Chew Toys:** Provide appropriate chew toys. This redirects destructive chewing. It also helps relieve stress.

Environmental enrichment addresses boredom. It gives your dog healthy ways to expend energy. This reduces the likelihood of stress-related accidents.

## The Importance of Thorough Carpet Cleaning

Cleaning accidents thoroughly is not just about removing stains. It is about removing the odor. Dogs have a powerful sense of smell. If they smell urine, they are likely to pee there again. This is why [how to clean dog urine from carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dog-urine-from-carpet) is so important.

### Why Enzyme Cleaners Are Essential

Enzyme cleaners are different from regular cleaners. They contain special enzymes. These enzymes break down the uric acid crystals in urine. This eliminates the odor.

*   **Breaks Down Uric Acid:** Regular cleaners remove the visible stain. They do not remove the scent. Enzyme cleaners target the source of the odor.
*   **Eliminates Odor:** If the smell remains, your dog will be drawn back to the spot. They will think it is their designated potty area.
*   **Prevents Re-marking:** By truly neutralizing the odor, you prevent your dog from re-marking the spot. This stops the cycle of accidents.
*   **Pet-Specific Formula:** Look for cleaners specifically designed for pet urine. These formulas are safe for pets and effective.

I have found that enzyme cleaners are indispensable. They are the only way to truly get rid of the urine smell. Do not skip this step.

### Step-by-Step Cleaning Process

Cleaning dog urine from carpet requires a specific process. Follow these steps for the best results. This ensures thorough removal.

1.  **Blot, Don't Rub:** As soon as you find the accident, blot the area. Use paper towels or a clean cloth. Press firmly to absorb as much urine as possible. Do not rub. Rubbing spreads the urine deeper into the carpet fibers.
2.  **Rinse with Water (Optional but Recommended):** Lightly pour clean water over the spot. This helps dilute the remaining urine. Blot again thoroughly to remove the water.
3.  **Apply Enzyme Cleaner Generously:** Pour or spray the enzyme cleaner directly onto the affected area. Make sure it soaks down to the padding. The urine likely soaked that far.
4.  **Allow Dwell Time:** Let the cleaner sit for the time recommended on the product label. This allows the enzymes to work. It is typically 10-15 minutes.
5.  **Blot Again:** Blot up the cleaner with fresh paper towels. Apply pressure.
6.  **Air Dry:** Allow the area to air dry completely. You can place a fan nearby to speed up drying.
7.  **Vacuum:** Once dry, vacuum the carpet. This restores the pile and removes any residue.

Following these steps ensures you fully clean the area. This prevents lingering odors. It stops future accidents in the same spot. It also helps with general carpet freshness, like when you are learning [how to freshen carpet in a home with a dog](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-freshen-carpet-in-a-home-with-a-dog).

### Preventing Recidivism (Repeat Accidents)

Cleaning is one part of preventing repeat accidents. You also need to change the dog's perception of the spot.

*   **Block Access Temporarily:** For a few days, try to block your dog's access to the cleaned area. You can use furniture or a baby gate.
*   **Change the Scent:** After cleaning, you can place a deterrent in the spot. A small bowl of citrus peels or a commercial pet repellent spray might work. Just ensure it is safe for your dog.
*   **Redirect Play:** Engage your dog in play or training activities near the spot. This changes their association with the area from a "bathroom" to a "play zone."
*   **Increase Supervision:** Be extra vigilant in the days following an accident. Catching any attempt to re-mark allows for immediate correction and redirection.

Preventing recidivism is crucial. It breaks the cycle of repeated accidents. It reinforces that the carpet is not a toilet. For general pet odor removal, knowing [how to get dog smell out of cars carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-dog-smell-out-of-cars-carpet) can also be helpful.

## Tools and Products for Prevention

Several tools and products can assist in stopping your dog from peeing on the carpet. They act as aids to your training efforts. They can provide temporary solutions or long-term protection.

### Puppy Pads (Temporary Use Only)

Puppy pads, or pee pads, are absorbent mats. They are designed for dogs to urinate on indoors. They can be useful in specific situations.

*   **Puppies:** Useful for very young puppies. They cannot hold their bladder long. Pads offer a designated indoor spot.
*   **Apartment Living:** Good for dogs in apartments without easy outdoor access. Especially useful during bad weather.
*   **Sick or Elderly Dogs:** Helpful for dogs with medical conditions or senior dogs with incontinence.
*   **Transitional Tool:** Use them as a temporary bridge to outdoor training. Gradually move the pad closer to the door. Eventually, remove it.

**Caution:** Do not overuse puppy pads. They can confuse dogs. Your dog may learn that peeing indoors is okay. This can make outdoor training harder. My advice is to transition away from them quickly.

### Crate Training Aids

Crates are invaluable house training tools. They help teach bladder control. They also provide a safe den for your dog.

*   **Crate:** Choose a crate of the correct size. Your dog should stand up and turn around. It should not have extra space.
*   **Crate Divider:** Many crates come with dividers. Use them to adjust the crate size as your puppy grows. This prevents accidents.
*   **Comfy Bedding:** Place a comfortable bed or blanket inside. This makes the crate inviting.
*   **Interactive Toys:** Give your dog a safe chew toy or puzzle toy. This keeps them occupied. It makes crate time pleasant.

A well-used crate prevents accidents. It teaches your dog to hold it. It helps them learn to ask to go outside.

### Doggy Doors

A doggy door allows your dog to access the yard freely. This can prevent accidents if your dog learns to use it.

*   **Independence:** Dogs can go outside whenever they need to. This reduces the risk of indoor accidents.
*   **Supervision Still Needed:** Monitor use at first. Ensure your dog understands how to use it. Make sure they are not bringing unwanted things inside.
*   **Security Concerns:** Ensure the doggy door is secure. Larger doors can be a security risk.
*   **Training Required:** Your dog needs to learn what the door is for. Guide them through it repeatedly. Reward them on the other side.

Doggy doors work best for dogs with established house training. They are not a substitute for initial training.

### Pet Repellents and Deterrents

Pet repellents are sprays or devices. They aim to make an area undesirable for dogs. They can be used on carpets.

*   **Scent-Based Sprays:** These have odors that dogs dislike. They can be citrus or bitter apple. Spray them on problem areas.
*   **Motion-Activated Sprays:** These emit a harmless spray of air or water when motion is detected. They startle the dog away.
*   **Ultrasonic Devices:** These emit high-frequency sounds. Dogs can hear them, but humans cannot. They deter dogs from an area.
*   **Effectiveness Varies:** Some dogs are unfazed by repellents. Others respond well. Experiment to see what works for your dog.

Use repellents in conjunction with training. They are not a standalone solution. Always check product safety for pets and carpets. For general prevention, knowing [how to keep carpet clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-carpet-clean) is also helpful.

### Waterproof Carpet Protectors

These products create a barrier between your carpet and potential accidents. They are a good temporary solution.

*   **Plastic Runners:** Clear plastic runners protect high-traffic areas. They can also protect areas prone to accidents.
*   **Waterproof Mats:** Place absorbent, waterproof mats in areas where accidents are likely. This could be near the door or under food bowls.
*   **Carpet Sprays:** Some sprays create a waterproof layer on carpet fibers. Always test on an inconspicuous area first.
*   **Machine Washable Rugs:** Consider using small, machine-washable rugs in high-risk areas. You can wash them easily after accidents.

Waterproof protectors offer peace of mind. They make cleaning much easier. They can save your carpet from damage.

## When to Consult a Vet or Professional Trainer

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the problem persists. This is when you should seek expert help. A vet or professional trainer can offer specialized guidance.

### Signs of Medical Issues Requiring a Vet

Always start with your vet if accidents appear suddenly. Medical issues must be ruled out first. Pay attention to these signs:

*   **Sudden Onset:** If a previously house-trained dog suddenly starts having accidents.
*   **Increased Frequency/Volume:** Your dog is peeing much more often or in larger amounts.
*   **Straining or Pain:** Your dog strains to urinate or cries during urination.
*   **Changes in Urine:** Urine appears cloudy, bloody, or has a strong, unusual odor.
*   **Excessive Thirst:** Your dog is drinking water much more than usual.
*   **Lethargy or Other Symptoms:** Accidents accompanied by unusual tiredness, vomiting, or appetite loss.

A vet can diagnose and treat underlying health problems. They may prescribe medication. This is the first and most important step.

### Persistent Behavioral Problems

If your vet says your dog is healthy, the issue is behavioral. Some behavioral problems are complex. They might require expert intervention.

*   **Severe Separation Anxiety:** If your dog panics when alone. They destroy things or hurt themselves.
*   **Aggression or Fear:** If accidents are linked to extreme fear or aggressive displays.
*   **Chronic Marking:** If spaying/neutering and cleaning do not stop marking.
*   **Lack of Progress:** If you have tried all training methods consistently for weeks with no improvement.
*
