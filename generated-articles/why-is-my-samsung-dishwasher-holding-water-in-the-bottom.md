## Fix Your Samsung Dishwasher's Standing Water Problem

Have you just finished a dishwashing cycle, only to open your Samsung dishwasher and find a pool of dirty water at the bottom? It is a frustrating sight. This issue means your dishwasher did not drain properly. You are not alone; many Samsung dishwasher owners face this problem.

Understanding why your Samsung dishwasher is holding water helps you fix it. This guide covers the most common reasons for standing water. We will explore simple solutions you can try yourself. My goal is to help you get your dishwasher working perfectly again. Let's dive in and solve this common appliance mystery together.

### Takeaway

*   **Check the Filter:** A dirty or clogged filter is the most common cause of standing water.
*   **Inspect the Drain Hose:** Kinks or clogs in the drain hose prevent water from exiting.
*   **Examine the Drain Pump:** A faulty drain pump cannot push water out.
*   **Clear the Air Gap/Garbage Disposal:** Obstructions in these components block drainage.
*   **Verify the Check Valve:** A stuck or faulty check valve keeps water in the tub.

Your Samsung dishwasher holds water in the bottom because a component in its drainage system is blocked or broken. Common culprits include a clogged filter, a kinked or obstructed drain hose, a malfunctioning drain pump, or issues with the air gap or garbage disposal connection.

## Clogged Dishwasher Filter and Sump Area

The most frequent reason a Samsung dishwasher holds water is a clogged filter. My own experience tells me this is usually the first place to look. Food particles, grease, and debris accumulate in the filter over time. This build-up blocks water from reaching the drain pump.

The filter is located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is designed to catch larger food scraps. If the filter becomes too dirty, water cannot flow through it efficiently. This leads to water pooling in the bottom of the tub after a wash cycle. Cleaning this filter regularly is a key maintenance task for any dishwasher owner.

### Steps to Clean the Filter

First, unplug your dishwasher from the power outlet. Safety is very important when working with appliances. Next, remove the lower dish rack to access the filter assembly. Samsung dishwashers often have a two-part filter system. This includes a cylindrical filter and a flat filter screen.

Twist the cylindrical filter counter-clockwise to unlock it. Then lift it out. After that, remove the flat filter located underneath. Rinse both parts under warm running water. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away any stuck-on food or grease. I sometimes use a little dish soap to cut through stubborn grime. Ensure you clean all crevices thoroughly. Once clean, reassemble the filters in the reverse order. Make sure they click securely into place. This prevents food from entering the pump and causing more issues. Regularly cleaning your dishwasher's filter can prevent many drainage problems.

## Issues with the Dishwasher Drain Hose

If your Samsung dishwasher still has standing water after cleaning the filter, check the drain hose. The drain hose carries wastewater from the dishwasher to your home's drain line or garbage disposal. Any problem with this hose can prevent proper drainage. A common issue is a kink or bend in the hose.

Sometimes, installers might accidentally pinch the hose during appliance setup. Over time, the hose can also sag or become bent behind the dishwasher. These kinks act like a dam, stopping water flow. Internal clogs from food debris can also block the hose. This is especially true if the filter has not been cleaned regularly.

### How to Inspect and Clear the Drain Hose

To inspect the drain hose, first, pull the dishwasher away from the wall carefully. You will need to access the back of the appliance. Locate the corrugated plastic hose connected to the dishwasher's drain pump. Follow this hose to where it connects to your sink drain or garbage disposal. Look for any visible kinks, twists, or bends. Gently straighten any you find.

If there are no visible kinks, the clog might be internal. Disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the drain pipe or garbage disposal. Have a bucket ready to catch any residual water. Use a long, flexible brush, like a plumbing snake, to push through the hose and clear any blockages. You can also try flushing water through it. Ensure the hose is clear before reconnecting it. Make sure there is a proper high loop in the hose after reinstallation. This prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher.

## Malfunctioning Drain Pump in Your Samsung Dishwasher

A drain pump is a vital part of your Samsung dishwasher's drainage system. It pushes water out of the appliance after a wash cycle. If this pump fails, water will simply sit in the tub. A malfunctioning drain pump is a common cause for water remaining in the bottom of your dishwasher. It may make unusual noises, or no noise at all, when it should be draining.

The drain pump can fail for several reasons. Sometimes, small, hard objects like glass shards, bone fragments, or even fruit pits bypass the filter. These items can get lodged in the pump's impeller. This prevents the impeller from spinning. Other times, the pump motor itself might burn out or wear down. This requires professional replacement.

### Checking and Replacing the Drain Pump

Checking the drain pump involves some technical steps. First, turn off the power to the dishwasher at the circuit breaker. This is a critical safety step. Pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet. You will likely need to tilt it on its side or back to access the bottom panel. Locate the drain pump, which is usually near the sump assembly.

Inspect the pump for visible obstructions. Remove the pump motor from its housing. Check the impeller inside for anything stuck in it. Use pliers or tweezers to carefully remove any debris. If the impeller spins freely after cleaning, the pump might be fine. If the pump appears clear but still does not work, you might need to test it with a multimeter for continuity. If there is no continuity, the pump is likely bad. Replacing a drain pump can be tricky. If you are not comfortable with electrical components, call a qualified appliance technician.

## Problems with the Air Gap or High Loop

Your Samsung dishwasher might have an air gap or a high loop installed. Both features prevent wastewater from your sink or garbage disposal from flowing back into the dishwasher. They are crucial for maintaining hygiene inside the appliance. If your dishwasher has an air gap, it is a small cylindrical fixture on your kitchen countertop, usually next to the faucet. If you do not have an air gap, your drain hose should have a high loop.

An air gap can become clogged with food debris. This debris builds up over time. If the air gap is blocked, water cannot drain properly from the dishwasher. It gets stuck. Similarly, if the drain hose lacks a high loop, or if the loop sags, wastewater can reverse flow. This causes standing water inside the dishwasher. It is a simple but often overlooked cause of drainage issues.

### Inspecting and Clearing the Air Gap/High Loop

To check the air gap, first remove its cover from the countertop. You may need to unscrew it. Lift off the cap and the inner plastic cylinder. Inspect both parts for any visible clogs or debris. Use a small brush or a paperclip to clear out any gunk. You can also try pouring a cup of hot water down the air gap to flush it. Reassemble the air gap once it is clear.

If you do not have an air gap, ensure your dishwasher's drain hose forms a high loop. The highest point of the hose should be above the dishwasher's drain connection. It should be securely fastened under the sink. This loop prevents backflow. If the hose sags, raise and secure it with a strap or zip tie. This simple fix can resolve many standing water problems. It is a good idea to perform this check if you notice your [Whirlpool dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) as well, as the principle is similar across brands.

## Drain Check Valve Obstruction

Another important component in your Samsung dishwasher's drain system is the drain check valve. This small, one-way valve prevents dirty water that has been pumped out from flowing back into the dishwasher tub. It acts like a gate, allowing water to exit but blocking its return. The check valve is typically located at the outlet of the drain pump or in the sump area.

If the check valve becomes stuck in a closed position, water cannot exit the dishwasher. If it gets stuck in an open position, dirty water from the drain line can re-enter the dishwasher. This also leaves standing water. Small food particles, grease, or detergent residue can cause the check valve to stick. A worn-out or damaged valve flap can also be the culprit.

### How to Access and Inspect the Check Valve

Accessing the drain check valve usually requires pulling the dishwasher out and tilting it. Ensure the power is off before you begin. Locate the drain pump and the connected drain hose. The check valve is often a small rubber or plastic flapper valve inside the pump housing or drain hose connection point. You might need to disconnect the drain hose from the pump or remove the sump cover to reach it.

Once you find the check valve, inspect it for any obstructions. Clear away any debris that might be preventing it from moving freely. Check the flap for tears or damage. If the flap is torn or missing, the valve needs replacement. You can try gently cleaning it and ensuring it moves back and forth. If the valve is not allowing water through, or is letting water back in, replacing it is the best solution. This fix might also apply to other brands like if your [LG dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom), as check valves are standard components.

## Sump or Drain Impeller Problems

The sump is the lowest point inside your Samsung dishwasher, where water collects before being pumped out. Inside the sump area, there's often an impeller or a chopper blade system. This impeller helps break down larger food particles before they reach the drain pump. It ensures smoother drainage. If this impeller gets jammed or damaged, it can hinder water flow to the drain pump.

Over time, hard debris like glass, bones, or fruit pits can get past the filter. These items can then jam the impeller blades. This prevents the water from being pushed out effectively. A worn-out impeller might also not create enough pressure to push water out. This results in water sitting in the bottom of the dishwasher.

### Troubleshooting the Sump and Impeller

First, make sure the dishwasher is unplugged. Remove the lower dish rack and the filter assembly to access the sump area. Use a flashlight to carefully inspect the bottom of the sump. Look for any foreign objects that might be jamming the impeller blades. These objects are usually small and hard to spot. Use needle-nose pliers or tweezers to carefully remove any visible debris.

If you can access the impeller directly, try to turn it manually. It should spin freely. If it feels stiff or does not move, there is likely a blockage. Some Samsung models might require removing the pump assembly to access the impeller more thoroughly. If the impeller blades are visibly damaged or broken, the part will need replacement. This often involves replacing the entire drain pump assembly, as the impeller is integral to it.

## Garbage Disposal Connection Issues

Many Samsung dishwashers connect directly to a garbage disposal unit under the sink. This connection serves as the drain point for the dishwasher's wastewater. A common and often overlooked reason for a dishwasher holding water is a problem with this specific connection. If the garbage disposal is clogged, it can create a backup. This prevents the dishwasher from draining properly.

A frequent issue occurs when a new garbage disposal is installed. New disposals come with a knockout plug in the dishwasher inlet port. This plug needs to be removed before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. If the plug is not removed, water simply hits a dead end. Food debris from the disposal can also back up into the dishwasher drain hose. This creates a blockage.

### Checking and Clearing the Garbage Disposal Connection

First, ensure your garbage disposal is clear of any food waste. Run the disposal for a minute with water to ensure it is functioning properly. If it is clogged, clear the disposal first. Next, check the drain hose connection from the dishwasher to the garbage disposal. Disconnect the hose from the disposal's inlet port. Have a bucket ready to catch any water.

Inspect the inlet port on the garbage disposal. If you have a new disposal and this is the first time using the dishwasher with it, look for a plastic knockout plug. If it is present, use a screwdriver and hammer to carefully punch it out. Reconnect the drain hose securely to the disposal. Make sure the hose clamp is tight. Run a short dishwasher cycle to test the drainage. This simple check can save you a lot of troubleshooting time.

## Control Board or Sensor Malfunctions

While less common, an electronic control board or a faulty sensor can cause your Samsung dishwasher to hold water. The control board acts as the "brain" of the dishwasher. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump, to execute the wash cycle and drainage. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the signal to the drain pump to activate. This leaves water in the tub.

Similarly, a water level sensor or pressure sensor can become faulty. These sensors tell the control board how much water is in the dishwasher. If a sensor gives an incorrect reading, the board might think the dishwasher is empty and not initiate the drain cycle. This can result in standing water. These electronic issues are usually the last things to check after ruling out mechanical problems.

### Diagnosing Electronic Issues

Diagnosing a control board or sensor issue is more complex. It often requires specific diagnostic tools or the expertise of a professional technician. You can try a simple reset first. Turn off the power to your dishwasher at the circuit breaker for 5-10 minutes. Then turn it back on. This can sometimes reset the control board and clear minor glitches.

If a reset does not work, check your dishwasher's user manual for diagnostic modes or error codes. Samsung dishwashers often display codes for specific problems. These codes can point to a sensor malfunction or a communication error with the control board. If an error code related to drainage or water levels appears, it suggests an electronic issue. Replacing a control board or sensor is a more involved repair. I recommend contacting Samsung service or a certified appliance repair person for these types of fixes. They have the training and specialized tools to diagnose and fix such problems safely.
