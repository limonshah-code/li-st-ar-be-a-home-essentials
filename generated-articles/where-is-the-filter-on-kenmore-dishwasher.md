## Find Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter: A Simple Guide

Picture this: you unload your Kenmore dishwasher, expecting sparkling dishes, but instead find them covered in food particles and grime. It's frustrating, right? Often, the culprit is a dirty or clogged filter. Many people do not know **where is the filter on Kenmore dishwasher**, let alone how to maintain it. Finding and cleaning your dishwasher filter is a simple step, yet it makes a huge difference in how your dishes look and how your appliance performs.

In this guide, I will walk you through the exact steps to locate the filter in your Kenmore dishwasher. We will cover removal, effective cleaning techniques, and correct reinstallation. Understanding this vital component will help you achieve cleaner dishes and extend the life of your appliance. Let's make your dishwasher work its best again.

### Takeaway:

*   Most Kenmore dishwasher filters sit at the bottom of the tub, beneath the lower spray arm.
*   Regular filter cleaning prevents poor dish cleaning, odors, and drainage problems.
*   You must turn off power before removing the filter for safety.
*   Cleaning involves rinsing under water and gently scrubbing with a brush and soap.

### Where is the filter on Kenmore dishwasher?

The filter on a Kenmore dishwasher is usually at the bottom of the tub. You will find it beneath the lower spray arm, typically as a two-part assembly. This assembly includes a coarse filter and a fine microfilter. These parts twist or lift out for easy cleaning.

### Understanding Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter System

Your Kenmore dishwasher works hard to clean your dishes. A key part of this process is its filter system. This system catches food particles and debris, stopping them from recirculating onto your clean dishes. Without a working filter, your dishes simply will not get clean.

Kenmore dishwashers usually use one of two main filter types. Some models have a self-cleaning filter. These filters grind up food particles during the wash cycle. Other models feature a manual-clean filter. This type of filter collects debris in a mesh basket that you must remove and clean by hand. It is important to know which type your Kenmore dishwasher has. Checking your user manual is the best way to confirm your specific model's filter type. This knowledge helps you understand how often to clean it and what to expect during maintenance. [Knowing how to find your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-your-dishwasher-filter) is the first step in ensuring your dishes are always spotless.

The filter’s job is simple: trap all the bits of food that come off your dishes. If the filter is clogged, water cannot flow freely, and food particles get stuck. This results in dirty dishes, strange noises, and unpleasant odors. Recognizing the importance of this small part saves you from many dishwasher headaches. Most filters are easy to access, making routine cleaning a breeze.

### Locating the Filter in Most Kenmore Dishwashers

Finding the filter in your Kenmore dishwasher is quite straightforward. It generally sits at the very bottom of the dishwasher tub. You will need to pull out the lower dish rack to get a clear view. Once the rack is out, look directly under the lower spray arm.

The filter usually appears as a cylindrical or round component. It often has a mesh or screen-like surface. Many Kenmore models have a two-part filter system. This system includes a larger, coarse filter and a smaller, fine microfilter. The coarse filter is usually a cup-shaped component. It sits around a central cylindrical microfilter. This setup works together to catch both large and tiny food scraps. When you look inside, you will easily spot it. Knowing [where is the filter on dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-filter-on-dishwasher) is a critical step for proper maintenance.

If your Kenmore dishwasher is an Elite model, the filter location is often the same. The design might vary slightly, but the general area remains consistent. It will still be at the bottom of the tub, under the lower spray arm. My own Kenmore model has its filter located exactly there, and it is usually quite easy to spot once the lower rack is removed. For more specific details on Elite models, you can always refer to your appliance's manual. Sometimes, certain models have slight variations in how the filter looks or attaches. However, the foundational location does not change much.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter

Removing the filter from your Kenmore dishwasher is a simple process. It requires no special tools. However, you must prioritize safety first. Always start by ensuring the dishwasher is completely off. I always turn off the power at the circuit breaker to be extra safe.

Here is how you remove the filter:

#### Pre-removal Checklist:

*   **Turn off Power:** Locate your dishwasher's circuit breaker and switch it off. This prevents any accidental starts during the process.
*   **Clear the Dishwasher:** Remove all dishes and the lower dish rack from inside the dishwasher. This gives you clear access to the tub's bottom.
*   **Locate the Filter:** As discussed, look for the cylindrical or round component at the bottom, often under the spray arm.

#### Gentle Extraction Techniques:

1.  **Identify Filter Parts:** Many Kenmore filters have two main parts. There is an upper filter assembly and a lower filter or mesh plate.
2.  **Twist the Upper Filter:** Gently grasp the upper filter cylinder. Rotate it counter-clockwise about a quarter turn. You should feel it unlock.
3.  **Lift Out the Assembly:** Once unlocked, lift the entire upper filter assembly straight up and out of the dishwasher.
4.  **Remove the Lower Mesh Plate:** If your model has a separate lower mesh plate, this may now lift out directly. Some models require you to unclip it. Be gentle to avoid damaging plastic tabs.
5.  **Inspect for Debris:** Look at both parts. You will likely see trapped food particles, grease, and other debris.

It is important to handle these parts with care. Plastic components can break if forced. If it does not twist easily, double-check your manual for specific instructions for your model. I have found that a gentle but firm twist usually works. If you are struggling, don't force it. Take a moment to re-read your manual.

This step is crucial before you can properly clean the filter.

### The Importance of Regular Kenmore Dishwasher Filter Cleaning

Cleaning your Kenmore dishwasher filter is not just a suggestion; it is a necessity for optimal performance. I cannot stress enough how much this simple task improves your dish cleaning results. A dirty filter blocks water flow and recirculates food particles back onto your supposedly clean dishes. This leads to spotty, grimy results. It's like trying to shower with a clogged drain – ineffective and messy.

Beyond poor cleaning, a clogged filter causes other problems. You might notice unpleasant odors emanating from your dishwasher. These smells come from decomposing food trapped in the filter. It also places extra strain on your dishwasher's pump, potentially leading to costly repairs over time. Regular cleaning extends the life of your appliance. A clean filter allows your dishwasher to operate efficiently, saving you energy and water in the long run. My own dishes improved dramatically once I started cleaning the filter every few weeks. [Knowing how often should you clean your dishwasher filter can prevent many problems](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-your-dishwasher-filter).

#### Signs of a Clogged Filter:

*   **Dirty Dishes:** Food particles, grit, or a film remain on dishes after a wash cycle.
*   **Unpleasant Odors:** A lingering sour or moldy smell comes from the dishwasher.
*   **Poor Drainage:** Water may not fully drain from the bottom of the tub. [This is a common symptom when your Kenmore dishwasher does not drain correctly](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kenmore-dishwasher-not-drain).
*   **Increased Noise:** The dishwasher may make louder humming or grinding sounds as it struggles to pump water.

#### Frequency of Cleaning:

*   **Every 1-2 Months:** For average use, cleaning the filter every one to two months is generally sufficient.
*   **More Frequently for Heavy Use:** If you wash heavily soiled dishes often, or run your dishwasher daily, consider cleaning it every few weeks.
*   **As Needed:** If you notice any of the signs of a clogged filter, clean it immediately.

Neglecting this maintenance step can quickly turn your powerful Kenmore appliance into an inefficient, smelly machine. [Learning how to clean your Kenmore dishwasher filter is a key part of maintaining its efficiency](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-kenmore). Taking a few minutes to clean the filter regularly keeps your dishes spotless and your dishwasher running smoothly.

### How to Clean Your Kenmore Dishwasher Filter Effectively

Once you have removed your Kenmore dishwasher filter, cleaning it is a straightforward process. You do not need any harsh chemicals. Simple household items work best. I always clean mine in the kitchen sink.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

#### Tools for Cleaning:

*   **Running Water:** A kitchen faucet with a strong spray.
*   **Soft Brush:** An old toothbrush or a small scrubbing brush is ideal.
*   **Dish Soap:** Regular liquid dish soap.

#### Cleaning Stubborn Debris:

1.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Hold the filter parts under warm, running water. Use the spray to dislodge as much loose food debris as possible. You will be surprised how much gunk comes off.
2.  **Apply Dish Soap:** Put a few drops of dish soap onto the filter mesh.
3.  **Gently Scrub:** Use your soft brush to gently scrub the mesh and plastic surfaces. Pay close attention to any crevices where food particles hide. For the coarse filter, make sure to clean inside the cup shape.
4.  **Rinse Again:** Rinse both filter parts thoroughly under running water until all soap residue and remaining debris are gone. Ensure the water flows freely through the mesh.
5.  **Inspect:** Hold the filter up to the light. Ensure you can see through the mesh clearly. If not, repeat the scrubbing and rinsing process.

Avoid using abrasive scrubbers or strong cleaning agents. These can damage the filter's delicate mesh or plastic components. A simple soak in warm, soapy water for 10-15 minutes can help loosen stubborn, dried-on food before scrubbing. This makes the cleaning process much easier. [For more specific instructions, especially if you have a Kenmore dishwasher filter model 665, it is good to follow detailed guides](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-kenmore-dishwasher-filter-665). Taking these steps ensures your filter is perfectly clean. This allows for optimal water circulation in your Kenmore dishwasher. Your dishes will thank you!

### Reinstalling the Kenmore Dishwasher Filter Correctly

Reinstalling your Kenmore dishwasher filter correctly is just as important as cleaning it. A poorly installed filter can lead to leaks, loud noises, or continued poor cleaning performance. Take your time with this step to avoid any future problems. I always double-check everything after putting it back together.

Here is how you ensure proper reinstallation:

#### Checking for Proper Seating:

1.  **Insert the Lower Mesh Plate (if applicable):** If your model has a separate lower mesh plate, place it back into its recess at the bottom of the dishwasher tub first. Make sure it sits flat and flush.
2.  **Position the Upper Filter Assembly:** Carefully lower the main cylindrical filter assembly into its opening. Align the tabs or arrows on the filter with the corresponding slots or markings in the dishwasher tub.
3.  **Twist to Lock:** Gently push down on the filter and rotate it clockwise. You should feel it click into place or lock securely. It only needs a quarter turn in most cases. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the plastic.
4.  **Verify Stability:** Give the filter a slight tug. It should feel secure and not lift easily. If it wobbles or lifts, it is not properly seated. Remove it and try again.

#### Testing After Reinstallation:

*   **Replace Lower Rack:** Slide the lower dish rack back into its position.
*   **Restore Power:** Turn the circuit breaker back on for your dishwasher.
*   **Run a Short Cycle:** Run a short rinse cycle or a quick wash cycle with no dishes. Keep an eye on the dishwasher for any signs of leaks, especially around the filter area. Listen for unusual noises.
*   **Check Performance:** After the cycle, open the door and ensure no water has accumulated around the filter, or that water has drained properly.

Proper reinstallation ensures that the filter seals correctly. This prevents food particles from bypassing the filter and keeps water contained. If you notice any issues during the test cycle, turn off the power and inspect the filter again. Make sure it is fully locked into position. A securely installed filter means your Kenmore dishwasher is ready to provide spotless results.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues After Filter Maintenance

Sometimes, even after cleaning your Kenmore dishwasher filter, you might still encounter problems. It is frustrating when your efforts do not yield perfect results. Do not worry; many common issues have simple fixes. I have run into a few myself.

#### Poor Cleaning Performance:

*   **Filter Not Fully Clean:** Re-check the filter. Even a small amount of trapped grease or food particles can reduce its effectiveness. Make sure you scrubbed all crevices and the mesh is completely clear.
*   **Spray Arm Clogs:** The filter is not the only part that can get clogged. The spray arms, located above and below your dishes, have small holes that can get blocked by hard water deposits or food bits. Remove the spray arms (they usually twist off) and clean their holes with a toothpick or small wire.
*   **Incorrect Detergent Use:** Using too little or too much detergent, or a poor-quality detergent, affects cleaning. Ensure you use a high-quality dishwasher detergent. Also, check if your detergent dispenser is working correctly.
*   **Hard Water Issues:** Hard water leaves mineral deposits. These reduce cleaning power and cause spots. Consider using a dishwasher cleaner or a rinse aid designed for hard water.

#### Water Leakage:

*   **Improper Filter Reinstallation:** This is the most common cause of leaks after filter maintenance. Re-check that the filter assembly is seated correctly and twisted tightly into its locked position. The seal must be flush with the tub bottom.
*   **Damaged Filter Gasket:** Inspect the rubber gasket or O-ring around the filter. If it is cracked, torn, or worn, it might not seal properly. You may need to replace the entire filter assembly.
*   **Other Leak Sources:** If the filter is definitely secure, the leak might come from elsewhere. Check the door seal, hose connections, or pump. These issues require a deeper look, possibly by a technician.

Remember, a clean filter is a vital component, but it is part of a larger system. If issues persist, consult your Kenmore dishwasher's user manual. It contains specific troubleshooting tips for your model. Sometimes, a professional repair person might be necessary for more complex problems. But often, a quick check of the filter or spray arms resolves most post-maintenance hiccups.
