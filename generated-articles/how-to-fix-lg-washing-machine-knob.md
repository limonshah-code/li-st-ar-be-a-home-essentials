It is truly frustrating when your LG washing machine knob stops working. You might turn it, and nothing happens, or it might just spin freely. A faulty knob can prevent you from selecting cycles or starting your wash. Fortunately, many common problems with an LG washing machine knob are simple DIY fixes. I have helped many people troubleshoot issues like this.

This article will show you how to diagnose the problem with your LG washing machine knob. We will cover common issues such as a loose, stripped, or broken knob.

### Clear Answer to Main Query

To fix an LG washing machine knob, first unplug the machine for safety. Inspect the knob and the shaft for damage like cracks or stripping. If the knob is broken, pry it off and replace it with a new one. If the shaft is stripped, you may need to replace the entire control panel.

## Understanding LG Washing Machine Knob Issues

LG washing machine knobs can fail for several reasons. Recognizing the specific problem helps you apply the correct fix. We see different types of damage, each needing a different repair approach.

### Common Problems with LG Washer Knobs

One common issue is a stripped knob. This happens when the plastic inside the knob that grips the shaft wears out. You turn the knob, but it just spins without engaging the washer's internal mechanism. The selector does not move.

Another problem is a broken knob. The plastic housing of the knob itself can crack or break off. This makes it impossible to grasp and turn the knob properly. Sometimes, the knob might even fall off completely.

The control shaft can also be the problem. This is the part that extends from the washing machine's control panel. If it is metal, it might bend. If it is plastic, it might snap or strip. This prevents the knob from sending commands to the washer.

### Why Knobs Fail

Knobs often fail due to regular wear and tear. Over time, the plastic components can degrade from repeated use. Forceful turning can also damage the knob or the shaft. Accidental impacts can cause cracks or breaks.

Sometimes, chemical exposure, like cleaning agents, can weaken the plastic over time. This makes the knob more brittle and prone to breaking. Extreme temperature changes might also contribute to material fatigue. Understanding these causes helps prevent future failures.

## Essential Tools and Safety for Knob Repair

Before you start any repair on your LG washing machine knob, gather your tools. Safety is paramount when working with appliances. Always follow safety precautions to avoid injury or further damage to your washer.

### Tools You Will Need

You will need a few basic tools to fix your LG washing machine knob. A flathead screwdriver is often useful for prying off the knob. Sometimes a Phillips head screwdriver is necessary if you need to remove screws for panel access. Pliers can help if you are dealing with a bent or stubborn shaft.

For replacement, you will need the correct new knob or a new control panel part. Always ensure you have the exact replacement part for your LG washing machine model. Having a flashlight can also help you see clearly in tight spaces. You can also look into general tips for [do-it-yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) repairs.

### Prioritizing Safety First

Always disconnect your LG washing machine from power before beginning any repair. Unplug the machine from the wall outlet. This prevents electric shock. Do not just turn it off; physically remove the plug.

Wear appropriate safety gear. This includes gloves to protect your hands from sharp edges or grime. Eye protection is also a good idea. Work in a well-lit area to see what you are doing clearly.

Take your time and do not rush. If you feel unsure about any step, stop and seek professional help. Your safety is more important than a quick fix.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Replacing a Stripped or Broken Knob

Replacing a stripped or broken LG washing machine knob is a common DIY fix. It does not require advanced skills. I recommend following these steps carefully to ensure a successful repair.

### Removing the Old Knob

First, ensure your LG washing machine is unplugged from the power outlet. This is the most important safety step. Locate the faulty knob. Most LG washing machine knobs simply pull straight off.

You might need to gently pry it using a flathead screwdriver. Insert the screwdriver carefully under the edge of the knob. Twist gently to loosen it. Be careful not to scratch the control panel. Once it is loose, pull the knob straight off the shaft.

If the knob has a set screw, you will need to unscrew it first. Some older models might have this. Use the correct screwdriver size for the screw. After removing the screw, the knob should slide off easily.

### Inspecting the Control Shaft

After removing the knob, inspect the control shaft. This is the part that sticks out from the control panel. Check if it is bent, broken, or stripped. If the shaft is plastic, look for signs of wear where the knob attaches.

If the shaft is metal, ensure it is straight and not loose. Sometimes, the shaft itself is fine, but the internal plastic sleeve of the knob is stripped. If the shaft is damaged, a simple knob replacement will not fix the issue. You may need to replace the entire control panel or the switch assembly behind it.

### Installing the New Knob

Once you have a new knob, align it with the control shaft. Make sure the D-shaped opening inside the new knob matches the D-shaped shaft. This ensures it fits correctly and will turn properly. Push the new knob firmly onto the shaft.

It should slide on and sit flush against the control panel. Give it a gentle turn to confirm it engages the shaft. If it has a set screw, tighten it now. Plug in your LG washing machine and test the new knob. Make sure it selects cycles correctly and stays in place.

## Addressing a Damaged Control Shaft or Switch

Sometimes, the LG washing machine knob is not the problem. The issue lies with the control shaft or the underlying switch. This requires a more involved repair. I have seen this happen when the knob was forced repeatedly.

### Accessing the Control Panel

Before starting, always unplug your LG washing machine. To access the control shaft, you often need to remove the top panel of your washer. On LG top-loader models, this usually involves unscrewing screws at the back of the top panel. Slide the panel back and then lift it off.

For LG front-loader models, you might need to remove the detergent drawer and then screws around the control panel. Some models require removing the entire top lid of the washing machine. Refer to your owner's manual for exact instructions for your specific LG model. This step is important for proper access and preventing damage.

### Replacing a Damaged Control Shaft

If the control shaft is damaged, it is usually part of a larger component. This might be the timer, the program selector switch, or the entire control board. Replacing just the shaft is rarely possible. You will need to replace the entire assembly.

Carefully disconnect any wiring harnesses attached to the assembly. Take photos before you disconnect them to remember where everything goes. Unscrew the mounting screws that hold the assembly in place. Install the new component, ensuring all wiring is reconnected correctly. Then, reattach the control panel and top panel.

### Fixing a Faulty Rotary Switch

The rotary switch is the electronic component directly behind the knob shaft. This switch sends the signals to the washer's brain. If the switch is faulty, the knob will turn but not register selections. This often means the internal contacts are worn or broken.

Replacing a rotary switch requires careful attention to wiring. Again, take pictures of the wiring before removing anything. Disconnect the wires, unscrew the old switch, and install the new one. Ensure all connections are secure. If you are unsure about wiring, it is best to call a professional. Issues like a persistent [LG washing machine IE error](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-washing-machine-ie-error) can sometimes stem from underlying control panel problems.

## Troubleshooting and Testing Your Repaired Knob

After you fix your LG washing machine knob, it is important to test it thoroughly. This ensures the repair was successful and your washer functions correctly. Do not skip this step; a small test can save you a big headache later.

### Initial Functionality Test

Once the new knob or control part is installed, plug your LG washing machine back in. Turn the knob slowly through all its settings. Does it click into place? Does the selected cycle light up on the display? This confirms the knob is physically engaging the shaft and the washer recognizes its position.

Try pressing the knob if it has a push-to-start function. Does the washer respond? If any part feels loose or unresponsive, you might need to recheck your installation. Ensure no wires are pinched and all screws are tight. Sometimes, fixing one thing reveals another, like needing to know [how to turn on a GE dryer without a knob](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-on-ge-dryer-without-knob) if you temporarily remove it.

### Running a Test Cycle

Next, select a short wash cycle, like a quick wash or rinse and spin. Add a small amount of laundry or just run it empty. Start the cycle. Listen for the washer to fill with water and begin agitation. Check that it progresses through the cycle as expected.

Observe the display for any error codes. If your LG washing machine shows codes like IE or OE, it indicates other problems. This test confirms the knob repair did not introduce new issues. If everything runs smoothly, congratulations, you fixed your LG washing machine knob!

### What If the Problem Persists?

If the knob still does not work, or new problems appear, review your steps. Did you get the correct replacement part for your specific LG model? Is every connection secure? Sometimes, the problem is not the knob but the main control board.

A damaged control board might not send signals correctly, even with a perfect knob. If you suspect this, it is often best to consult a professional appliance technician. They have specialized tools and diagnostic equipment. They can accurately diagnose complex electrical issues.

## Preventative Measures and Maintenance

After successfully fixing your LG washing machine knob, consider adopting some preventative measures. This can help extend the life of your new knob and prevent future issues. A little care goes a long way.

### Gentle Use is Key

Always turn your washing machine knob gently. Avoid forcing it or turning it too quickly. LG washing machine knobs are typically made of plastic, which can break under excessive force. Teach everyone in your household to use the knob carefully.

Do not use the knob as a handle to pull the machine. This can put undue stress on the shaft and internal components. Treat your washing machine controls with respect, just like any other sensitive electronic device. Proper handling can significantly extend the lifespan of your appliance's parts.

### Regular Cleaning and Inspection

Keep the area around your LG washing machine knob clean. Dust, grime, or detergent residue can build up around the knob base. This can make it stiff or hard to turn. Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe down the control panel regularly. Avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage the plastic or printed labels.

Periodically, gently pull on the knob to ensure it is still firmly attached. Look for any signs of cracks or wear on the knob itself. Early detection of minor damage can prevent a complete breakdown. If you notice a loose fit, address it promptly to avoid stripping the shaft. Regular cleaning helps maintain overall machine health. For example, knowing [how to clean an LG HE washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-he-washing-machine) can prevent grime buildup in other areas too.

### Avoid Overloading the Washer

Overloading your LG washing machine can cause excessive vibration during cycles. This vibration can slowly loosen or damage components over time, including the control knob and its internal workings. Follow your washer's capacity guidelines.

Distribute laundry evenly inside the drum. An unbalanced load can lead to more intense vibrations. Reducing strain on the machine's components helps maintain their integrity. This not only protects the knob but also extends the life of other parts like bearings and shock absorbers.

## When to Call a Professional

While many LG washing machine knob issues are DIY friendly, some problems require expert help. Knowing when to call a professional technician can save you time, money, and further damage. Do not hesitate to seek help if the repair feels beyond your skill level.

### Complex Electrical Issues

If your LG washing machine knob repair leads to new electrical problems, call a professional. This includes issues like sparks, strange smells, or complete power failure. Messing with wiring can be dangerous. Technicians have the training and tools to diagnose and safely repair electrical faults.

If the problem is rooted in the main control board, replacement can be complex. Control boards are expensive and difficult to install correctly without experience. A wrong connection can damage the new board or other components. This is not a job for a novice.

### Persistent Problems After DIY Attempts

If you have tried to fix your LG washing machine knob but the problem persists, it is time for professional help. You might have misdiagnosed the issue. There could be an underlying problem you cannot see. Sometimes, the symptom (broken knob) is masking a deeper issue with the washer's internal electronics.

A technician can perform a thorough diagnostic check. They can identify less obvious faults. This includes sensor failures or programming errors. They can also ensure the washing machine is operating safely.

### Warranty Considerations

If your LG washing machine is still under warranty, consult the manufacturer before attempting any DIY repairs. Performing unauthorized repairs might void your warranty. Check your warranty terms.

A professional service call might be covered under the warranty. This saves you the cost of parts and labor. Contact LG customer support to inquire about warranty service for your specific washing machine model. They can guide you on the best course of action.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use super glue to fix a stripped LG washing machine knob?
