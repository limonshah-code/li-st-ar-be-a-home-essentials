## Find the Perfect Fit: How To Measure For Patio Furniture Covers

Your patio furniture provides a comfortable space for relaxation. Protecting it from the elements is important. Weather, dust, and debris can damage your outdoor pieces over time. Using the right patio furniture covers extends the life of your investment. But, covers only work well when they fit correctly. Knowing how to measure for patio furniture covers is the first step.

This guide will show you how to get accurate measurements. We will cover different furniture types and discuss important measurement considerations. You will learn about selecting the right cover style. We also share tips for maintaining your covers. Get ready to protect your outdoor living space like a pro.

### Takeaway

*   Measure length, width, and height for each furniture piece.
*   Add 1-2 inches to dimensions for a slightly loose fit.
*   Consider the shape and specific features of your furniture.
*   Choose cover materials suitable for your climate.
*   Store covers properly when not in use.

To measure for patio furniture covers, accurately record the length, width (or depth), and height of each piece. Add 1-2 inches to each dimension to ensure the cover slips on easily and allows for proper airflow, preventing moisture buildup. Always measure at the widest or tallest points, including any protruding elements.

## Why Accurate Measurements Matter for Patio Furniture Covers

Choosing the correct size for your patio furniture covers is crucial. An ill-fitting cover does not provide good protection. A cover that is too small will not fit over the furniture at all. A cover that is too large can flap in the wind. This flapping can cause wear and tear on both the cover and the furniture.

Correctly sized covers offer the best defense against weather. They stop rain, snow, and UV rays from damaging your furniture. Proper fit also keeps dust and dirt away. This means less cleaning for you later. An accurate measurement ensures your outdoor furniture stays in top condition.

### Protecting Your Outdoor Investment

Patio furniture represents a significant investment. Weather elements like sun, rain, and wind can quickly degrade materials. UV rays fade fabrics and break down plastics. Rain causes rust on metal frames and encourages mold growth on cushions. Wind can blow furniture around, causing physical damage.

Covers act as a shield. They protect against these harmful factors. A well-fitted cover creates a barrier. This barrier keeps your furniture looking new for longer. It prevents expensive repairs or replacements. You save money by extending the life of your outdoor pieces.

### Avoiding Common Cover Mistakes

Many people make mistakes when buying furniture covers. The most common error is guessing the size. Another mistake is buying a general-purpose cover for a specific piece. These errors lead to covers that do not perform well. A cover that is too tight can rip. A cover that is too loose can collect water.

Loose covers also become a sail in strong winds. They can blow off, leaving your furniture exposed. They can also chafe against the furniture, causing scratches. Accurate measurements prevent these problems. They ensure you buy a cover that fits snugly but also allows for ventilation. This creates the best protection.

## Essential Tools and Preparations for Measuring

Before you start measuring, gather the right tools. Having everything ready makes the process smoother. It also helps you get more accurate results. You will not have to stop and search for items. Being prepared saves time and prevents frustration.

Good tools are key to good measurements. A flexible tape measure is very important. A notepad and pen help you record numbers accurately. Taking a picture of each furniture piece can also be helpful. This picture reminds you of its shape and features later.

### Gathering Your Measuring Kit

You do not need many tools, but the right ones are essential. Here is a simple list:

*   **Tape Measure:** A fabric or flexible metal tape measure is best. It should be long enough for your largest furniture pieces. Look for one at least 10-12 feet long.
*   **Pen and Paper/Notepad:** You will write down several numbers. Keep them organized.
*   **Helper (Optional):** For large or awkward items, an extra pair of hands helps. They can hold one end of the tape measure.
*   **Camera (Optional):** Take photos of each piece. This helps visualize its shape when shopping for covers.
*   **Clipboard (Optional):** A clipboard provides a firm surface for writing outdoors.

Make sure your tape measure is accurate. Old, stretched fabric tapes might give incorrect readings. A new, sturdy tape measure is a good investment. It ensures your patio furniture covers fit perfectly.

### Preparing the Furniture

Before you measure, prepare your patio furniture. This step ensures you get the most accurate dimensions. Do not measure furniture that is dirty or cluttered. Remove anything that would alter its true size.

Here are the steps to prepare:

1.  **Clear the Furniture:** Remove all cushions, pillows, and any decorative items. You need to measure the furniture frame itself. If you plan to cover cushions *with* the furniture, measure the cushions while they are on the furniture.
2.  **Clean the Furniture:** Wipe down any dirt or debris. This makes handling the furniture pleasant. It also ensures nothing interferes with the tape measure. For tips on cleaning, you might find this helpful: [how to clean outdoor furniture](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-outdoor-furniture).
3.  **Arrange Furniture as It Will Be Covered:** If you plan to cover a sectional as one piece, arrange it in its usual configuration. If you will cover individual chairs, measure them individually.
4.  **Consider Fixed Elements:** Note any parts that stick out. Examples include armrests, high backs, or decorative finials. These must fit under the cover. You will measure to the outermost points.

Taking these steps ensures your measurements are precise. Precision leads to a well-fitting cover. A well-fitting cover gives your patio furniture the best protection.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Measuring Different Furniture Types

Measuring different types of patio furniture requires specific approaches. While the basic principle of length, width, and height remains, where you measure changes. Some pieces have irregular shapes. Others have features that stick out. I will walk you through how to measure common patio furniture items.

Always remember to measure the maximum dimensions. This means measuring from the longest point to the longest point. Do the same for width and height. Add 1-2 inches to each measurement. This extra space makes the cover easy to put on and take off. It also allows air to circulate, which helps prevent mold and mildew.

### Measuring Rectangular or Square Tables

Rectangular and square tables are straightforward to measure. You need three key dimensions: length, width, and height. Make sure to include any umbrella poles if you plan to cover them with the table. If your table has a specific umbrella hole, some covers are designed with this feature.

Here is how to measure them:

1.  **Length:** Measure the longest side of the table from edge to edge.
2.  **Width:** Measure the shorter side of the table from edge to edge.
3.  **Height:** Measure from the ground to the highest point of the tabletop. If your table has a center umbrella hole, and you plan to cover the umbrella *with* the table, measure to the top of the umbrella. Otherwise, just measure the tabletop height.

Write down these three numbers. Label them clearly as Length (L), Width (W), and Height (H). Do not forget to add your 1-2 inch allowance to each number before shopping for a cover.

### Measuring Round or Oval Tables

Round and oval tables need slightly different measurements. For round tables, you need the diameter and height. For oval tables, you need the longest length, the widest width, and the height. Again, consider any umbrella poles or unique table features.

Here is how to measure them:

*   **For Round Tables:**
    1.  **Diameter:** Measure across the center of the table, from one edge to the opposite edge. This is your diameter.
    2.  **Height:** Measure from the ground to the highest point of the tabletop. Include the umbrella pole if covering it.
*   **For Oval Tables:**
    1.  **Length:** Measure the longest dimension of the table, from end to end.
    2.  **Width:** Measure the widest dimension of the table, across the middle.
    3.  **Height:** Measure from the ground to the highest point of the tabletop.

Record these dimensions carefully. Add the extra inches for a comfortable fit. Many covers for round or oval tables will list their dimensions similarly.

### Measuring Chairs and Loveseats

Chairs and loveseats can vary greatly in design. Some are simple, while others have high backs or deep seats. Always measure to the outermost points. This includes the tips of armrests or the top of a decorative back.

Here is how to measure chairs and loveseats:

1.  **Length (or Width):** Measure from the widest point of one armrest to the widest point of the other armrest. If it's a loveseat, measure the full width across the front.
2.  **Depth:** Measure from the front edge of the seat to the furthest point of the back. If the back curves, measure from the point furthest forward to the point furthest backward.
3.  **Height:** Measure from the ground to the highest point of the chair or loveseat. This often means the top of the backrest. Include any decorative finials or high points.

For stacking chairs, you can measure them as a stack. This saves money on multiple covers. Stack them neatly first. Then, measure the length, depth, and height of the entire stack. This can be a smart way to store multiple chairs.

### Measuring Sofas and Sectionals

Sofas and sectionals are some of the largest patio furniture pieces. Measuring them accurately is vital for a good cover fit. For sectionals, you must decide if you want one large cover or multiple smaller covers. One large cover offers seamless protection. Multiple covers allow more flexibility in arrangement.

Let's break down measuring for these:

*   **For a Standard Sofa:**
    1.  **Length:** Measure the total length from one outer armrest to the other.
    2.  **Depth:** Measure from the front of the sofa to the furthest point of the backrest. Include any back cushions if they will remain on the sofa under the cover.
    3.  **Height:** Measure from the ground to the highest point of the sofa's back.

*   **For a Sectional Sofa:**
    This requires a bit more thought.
    1.  **Option 1: Measure as individual pieces.** Treat each part of the sectional (e.g., corner piece, armless chair, ottoman) as a separate item. Measure its length, depth, and height individually. This allows for individual covers. For more detailed tips on sofa covers, see [how to measure a sofa for a cover](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-measure-a-sofa-for-a-cover).
    2.  **Option 2: Measure as one large unit.** Arrange the sectional in its final configuration. Then, measure the longest length, the greatest depth, and the highest point of the entire assembled unit. You might need to measure in an 'L' or 'U' shape. For example, for an L-shaped sectional, you would measure the length of each leg of the 'L' and the overall depth and height. Some manufacturers offer specific sectional covers with 'L' or 'U' shaped options. Be precise with these larger measurements.

Remember your 1-2 inch allowance for all dimensions. This will make placing and removing the cover much easier.

### Measuring Umbrellas and Fire Pits

Besides seating and tables, other patio items need covers. Umbrellas and fire pits are common examples. They also need specific measurements to ensure a proper fit.

*   **For Umbrellas:**
    1.  **Height:** Measure from the ground to the very top of the closed umbrella.
    2.  **Canopy Diameter (or width when folded):** Measure the widest point of the closed canopy. Sometimes this is the diameter of the pole if the canopy folds very tightly. Most umbrella covers are cylindrical. You need to ensure the width of the folded canopy fits.
    *Some covers are designed for specific umbrella types, like cantilever or market umbrellas. Be sure to note your umbrella's style.*

*   **For Fire Pits:**
    1.  **Diameter (for round fire pits):** Measure across the widest point of the fire pit.
    2.  **Length and Width (for square/rectangular fire pits):** Measure the longest side and the shortest side.
    3.  **Height:** Measure from the ground to the highest point of the fire pit. Include any screen or cover if it will remain on the fire pit when covered.

Always ensure that any handles or features that stick out are included in your measurements. The goal is to get a cover that fully encloses the item without being too tight.

## Understanding Cover Styles and Fit Allowances

Not all patio furniture covers are created equal. They come in different styles and fits. Understanding these differences helps you choose the best one. The goal is a cover that protects well and looks good. A good fit provides proper air circulation and prevents water pooling.

Knowing about fit allowances is also very important. This refers to the extra space built into the cover's dimensions. It is the reason you add a few inches to your furniture measurements. This allowance is crucial for ease of use and protection.

### Standard vs. Custom Fit Covers

You will generally find two main types of patio furniture covers:

*   **Standard Fit Covers:** These are the most common type. They come in preset sizes. Manufacturers design them to fit a range of common furniture dimensions. They are often more affordable and readily available. When buying a standard fit cover, compare your furniture's measurements to the cover's listed dimensions. Remember your added 1-2 inches. If your furniture is a standard size, these covers are a great option.
*   **Custom Fit Covers:** If your patio furniture has unusual shapes or very large dimensions, custom covers might be necessary. These covers are made to your exact specifications. They offer the best fit and often have premium features. Custom covers are more expensive. They also take longer to make. However, they provide superior protection and a tailored look. Some companies specialize in custom outdoor covers.

The choice between standard and custom depends on your furniture and budget. Most common patio furniture sets will find a good fit with standard covers.

### The Importance of Airflow and Hem Allowances

When I mentioned adding 1-2 inches to your measurements, this accounts for "allowance." This allowance serves two main purposes:

1.  **Ease of Use:** A cover that is exactly the same size as your furniture will be very difficult to put on and take off. The extra space makes it easy to slide the cover over all corners and edges.
2.  **Airflow and Ventilation:** This is perhaps the most critical reason. A cover that is too tight can trap moisture underneath. This creates a humid environment. Humidity leads to mildew and mold growth on your furniture and cushions. The 1-2 inch allowance creates a small air gap between the furniture and the cover. This allows for air circulation. Some high-quality covers also include built-in air vents. These vents further improve airflow.

**Hem Allowance:** Covers typically have a hem at the bottom. This hem adds durability and sometimes includes a drawstring or buckle system. This system helps secure the cover in windy conditions. Ensure the cover's height measurement includes enough length to cover the furniture completely down to the ground or close to it. A cover that is too short leaves the bottom of your furniture exposed. This can let moisture or pests get underneath.

Proper allowance ensures your cover protects the furniture effectively. It also makes the cover last longer.

## Tips for Choosing the Right Patio Furniture Cover Material

Measuring is important, but so is the material of your cover. The right material protects your furniture best. It also lasts longer in your specific climate. Different materials offer different levels of water resistance, UV protection, and durability. Choosing wisely saves you from buying new covers too often.

Consider your local weather conditions. Do you get a lot of rain, strong sun, or heavy snow? Your answer will guide your material choice. Also, think about how often you will be putting covers on and taking them off. Some materials are heavier or stiffer than others.

### Common Material Types

Here are some common materials used for patio furniture covers:

*   **Polyester:** This is a very common choice. It is durable, relatively lightweight, and often coated for water resistance. Many polyester covers have a PVC backing for extra waterproofing. Polyester offers good value.
*   **Vinyl:** Vinyl covers are very waterproof. They are strong and resist tears well. However, vinyl can become stiff in cold weather. It may also crack over time if exposed to extreme temperature changes.
*   **Woven Fabric (e.g., Solution-Dyed Acrylic/Polyester Blends):** These are premium options. They often feel more like fabric than plastic. They are breathable, resisting mold and mildew. They are also highly fade-resistant due to the dyeing process. They are more expensive but offer excellent long-term protection and appearance.
*   **Polyethylene (PE):** This is often used for economy covers. It is lightweight and water-resistant. PE covers may not be as durable as polyester or woven fabrics. They are good for light use or temporary protection.

Each material has pros and cons. Think about what is most important for you. Do you need maximum waterproofing, or is breathability more important?

### Features to Look For in Quality Covers

Beyond the main material, several features enhance a cover's performance and longevity:

*   **Waterproof vs. Water-Resistant:** "Waterproof" means no water gets through. "Water-resistant" means it repels water but might soak through in heavy, prolonged rain. For best protection, aim for truly waterproof materials or those with good waterproof coatings.
*   **UV Protection:** Sunlight degrades fabrics. Look for covers with UV-stabilized materials or coatings. This prevents fading and cracking. It extends the life of both the cover and your furniture.
*   **Vents:** As discussed earlier, vents prevent moisture buildup. They also reduce wind lofting. Look for covers with covered mesh vents that allow air to circulate but keep rain out.
*   **Straps/Buckles/Drawstrings:** These features are critical for keeping the cover on in windy conditions. Adjustable straps or buckles secure the cover to furniture legs. A drawstring at the hem can cinch the cover tight.
*   **Sealed Seams:** Check if the seams are taped or sealed. Water can leak through stitched seams. Sealed seams prevent this.
*   **Handles:** Some larger covers come with handles. These make it much easier to put on and take off the cover.

Investing in a quality cover with these features pays off. It protects your furniture better and lasts longer.

## Common Measurement Challenges and Solutions

Measuring for patio furniture covers can sometimes present difficulties. Furniture comes in all shapes and sizes. Some pieces have unique designs. Other times, cushions add to the challenge. But there are solutions for these common problems. Do not let these challenges stop you from getting the right fit.

I will explain how to handle irregular shapes. We will also cover measuring with cushions. Finally, I will talk about covering multiple pieces. With these tips, you can measure any patio furniture with confidence.

### Dealing with Irregular Shapes

Many patio furniture pieces do not have simple box shapes. They might have curved backs, deep recliners, or built-in side tables. These irregular shapes require careful measurement.

Here is how to approach them:

*   **Measure the Widest/Deepest/Tallest Point:** Always measure to the outermost edge. If a chair curves, measure from the point furthest forward to the point furthest back. If an armrest flares out, measure to the tip of that flare. This ensures the cover will go over everything.
*   **Use Flexible Tape:** A flexible fabric or plastic tape measure works best for curves. It can bend around the shape of the furniture.
*   **Consider the Overall Envelope:** Imagine a rectangular box that would perfectly enclose your furniture. Measure the length, width, and height of this imaginary box. This is your "footprint" for the cover.
*   **Take Photos:** A photo helps you remember the shape. When looking at covers online, you can refer to your photo. This helps you visualize how a standard cover might fit your unique piece.
*   **Look for Specialty Covers:** Some furniture companies offer covers designed specifically for their unique pieces. This is often the easiest solution if available.

If your furniture is very unusual, a custom cover might be your best option. It ensures a perfect fit for any shape.

### Handling Furniture with Cushions

A common question is whether to measure with or without cushions. The answer depends on how you plan to store your furniture.

*   **Measuring with Cushions On:** If you leave your cushions on the furniture when covering it, measure with them in place. Stack them as they normally would be. Then, measure the length, width, and height of the furniture *including* the cushions. This adds bulk, so your measurements will be larger.
*   **Measuring Without Cushions:** If you remove cushions for storage (e.g., in a storage box or indoors), then measure the furniture frame only. This will result in smaller dimensions. Many people prefer this method. It keeps cushions dry and clean separately. It also reduces the size of the cover needed.

Always decide beforehand if cushions will be covered with the furniture. This choice affects your measurements directly. If you remove cushions, remember to find a separate storage solution for them. This might include a [storage bin for cushions](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-store-patio-furniture-in-garage) or bringing them indoors.

### Accounting for Multiple Pieces

Sometimes, you want to cover several small pieces together. This can be more economical than buying individual covers. For example, you might cover two chairs and a small side table under one large cover.

Here is how to do it:

1.  **Arrange the Pieces:** Place the furniture items together as tightly as possible. Arrange them in the most compact configuration you can. Imagine them as one single unit.
2.  **Measure as One Unit:** Measure the overall length, width (depth), and height of this combined unit. Measure from the outermost point of any piece. This means if one chair is taller, its height defines the overall height. If one piece sticks out further, its dimension defines the overall depth.
3.  **Add Allowance:** Still add the 1-2 inch allowance to these combined measurements.

This strategy works well for sets that are often used together. It simplifies covering and uncovering. However, ensure the combined weight of snow or water does not overwhelm the cover if covering multiple pieces under one. Also, consider access to individual pieces.

## Beyond Measurement: Maintaining Your Patio Furniture Covers

Measuring correctly is the first step. But patio furniture covers need care too. Proper maintenance extends their lifespan. It also ensures they continue to protect your furniture effectively. A well-maintained cover prevents mildew and remains functional.

Neglecting your covers can lead to problems. They might lose their waterproof properties. They could tear or develop mold. I will share some basic cleaning tips. I will also discuss proper storage when covers are not in use.

### Cleaning and Care Tips

Keeping your patio furniture covers clean is important. Dirt, pollen, and environmental debris can build up. This can affect the cover's performance and appearance.

Here are simple cleaning steps:

1.  **Regular Wiping:** Use a soft brush or a damp cloth to wipe off loose dirt and dust. Do this weekly or bi-weekly.
2.  **Spot Cleaning:** For stubborn spots, use a mild soap and water solution. Apply with a sponge. Gently scrub the affected area. Rinse thoroughly with clean water.
3.  **Deep Cleaning:** If the cover is very dirty, a more thorough cleaning might be needed. Lay the cover flat on a clean surface. Spray it with a hose. Use a soft brush and a mild soap solution. Scrub gently. Rinse all soap completely.
4.  **Drying:** Always allow the cover to air dry completely before storing or putting back on furniture. Wet covers encourage mold and mildew. Hang them over a line or lay them flat in the sun.
5.  **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Do not use bleach or strong detergents. These can damage the waterproof coating or fade the material.
6.  **Washing Machine (Check Label):** Some covers are machine washable. Always check the manufacturer's care label first. If safe, use a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent. Air dry afterward. For more specific advice, you can check guides like [how to wash patio furniture covers in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-patio-furniture-covers-in-washing-machine) or [how to clean outdoor furniture covers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-outdoor-furniture-covers).

Regular cleaning keeps your covers in good shape. It ensures they provide maximum protection against the elements.

### Proper Storage for Longevity

When you are not using your patio furniture covers, store them properly. This protects them from damage and keeps them ready for the next season. Improper storage can lead to creases, cracks, or even pest damage.

Follow these storage guidelines:

1.  **Clean and Dry Completely:** This is the most crucial step. Never store a damp or dirty cover. It will quickly develop mold, mildew, or a bad odor. Ensure it is bone dry.
2.  **Fold Neatly:** Fold the cover carefully to avoid sharp creases. Sharp creases can weaken the material over time. Rolling can also work for some covers.
3.  **Store in a Dry Place:** Keep covers in a cool, dry place. A garage, shed, or dedicated storage bin is ideal. Avoid attics or basements that might be damp or have extreme temperature fluctuations.
4.  **Use a Storage Bag (Optional):** Many covers come with a storage bag. This protects them from dust and pests during off-season storage. If yours did not, a breathable storage container works well.
5.  **Protect from Pests:** Ensure your storage area is free from rodents or insects. They can chew through fabric.

Proper storage, combined with regular cleaning, will make your patio furniture covers last for many years. This means continued protection for your valuable outdoor furniture.

## FAQ Section

### How much extra room should I add to my furniture measurements for a cover?
You should add 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) to each dimension – length, width, and height. This allowance ensures the cover slips on easily. It also provides crucial space for air circulation. This air gap prevents moisture buildup and helps stop mold and mildew from forming underneath the cover.

### Can I use one large cover for multiple patio furniture pieces?
Yes, you can. Arrange the multiple pieces as compactly as possible, mimicking how they will sit under the cover. Then, measure the combined length, width, and height of the entire unit. Add the standard 1-2 inches for allowance. This can be more cost-effective and convenient than individual covers.

### Do I measure patio furniture covers with or without cushions?
It depends on your preference. If you plan to leave cushions on the furniture when covered, measure with them in place. This will give you larger dimensions. If you remove cushions for separate storage, measure the furniture frame only. Always decide this before measuring to ensure accuracy.

### What is the best material for patio furniture covers?
The best material depends on your climate. Polyester with a PVC backing offers good waterproofing and durability for most conditions
