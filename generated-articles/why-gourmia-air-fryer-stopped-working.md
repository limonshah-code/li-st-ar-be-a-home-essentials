### 1. Power Supply and Connection Issues for Your Gourmia Air Fryer

The first step in diagnosing why your **Gourmia air fryer stopped working** is always to check its power source. Many issues stem from simple electrical problems. Sometimes, the appliance receives no power. Other times, it gets insufficient power. These issues prevent the air fryer from turning on or operating correctly.

#### Unplugged or Loose Power Cord

It sounds obvious, but a loose power cord is a common culprit. The cord might have been pulled slightly from the wall outlet or the back of the air fryer. During normal kitchen use, cords can become dislodged. Always ensure the plug sits firmly in the wall socket. Also, check the connection point on the air fryer itself. A secure connection is vital for continuous power flow.

#### Faulty Wall Outlet

Your air fryer needs a working electrical outlet. Sometimes, an outlet itself stops providing power. This can happen due to internal wiring problems within your home. You can test the outlet easily. Plug another small appliance, like a lamp or a phone charger, into the same outlet. If the other appliance does not work either, the outlet is likely the problem. Try plugging your Gourmia air fryer into a different, known-good outlet. This simple test helps rule out your wall outlet as the cause.

#### Tripped Circuit Breaker

Modern homes have circuit breakers for safety. These breakers trip when an electrical circuit overloads. An air fryer draws a significant amount of power. If you have too many high-wattage appliances running on the same circuit, the breaker might trip. This cuts power to everything on that circuit. Go to your home's electrical panel. Look for a breaker that is in the "off" position or in between "on" and "off." Flip it completely off, then firmly back to the "on" position. If it trips again immediately, there is an electrical issue in your home wiring. You should call an electrician in such cases.

#### Internal Wiring Problems

Less commonly, the internal wiring of your Gourmia air fryer might have a fault. This is harder to diagnose without opening the unit. Loose or damaged wires inside the appliance can interrupt power. If you have checked external power sources and found no issue, internal wiring could be the cause. Such issues often require professional repair. Do not attempt to fix internal wiring unless you are a qualified technician. Tampering with electrical components can be dangerous. For more general troubleshooting advice if your unit isn't behaving as expected, refer to [Why Isn't My Gourmia Air Fryer Working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-isnt-my-gourmia-air-fryer-working).

Power issues are fundamental. Always start by checking these first. A surprising number of problems are resolved by simply plugging in correctly or resetting a breaker. When your Gourmia air fryer stopped working, the power source is the first place to look.

### 2. Overheating and Safety Mechanisms in Gourmia Air Fryers

Air fryers get very hot during operation. To prevent damage and ensure user safety, Gourmia air fryers, like most modern appliances, include several safety mechanisms. These features can cause your Gourmia air fryer to stop working or shut down unexpectedly. Understanding them helps you troubleshoot the problem effectively.

#### Automatic Shut-off Feature

Every Gourmia air fryer has an automatic shut-off feature. This safety mechanism activates when the appliance reaches a certain internal temperature. If the air fryer gets too hot, it will shut down to prevent damage to its internal components and reduce fire risk. This is a common reason why your **Gourmia air fryer stopped working** suddenly in the middle of a cooking cycle. It is not necessarily a malfunction but a safety response. Allow the unit to cool down completely before trying to turn it on again. This might take 20-30 minutes. Once cool, it should reset and operate normally.

#### Blocked Air Vents

Air fryers work by circulating hot air. They have intake and exhaust vents to facilitate this airflow. If these vents become blocked, the hot air cannot escape efficiently. This leads to a rapid increase in the internal temperature of the appliance. Common blockages include food particles, grease buildup, or even objects like towels or cookbooks placed too close to the vents. Regularly check the vents, usually located on the back or bottom of the unit. Ensure they are clear of any obstructions. Proper airflow is critical for the air fryer to maintain a safe operating temperature and function correctly.

#### Overfilling the Basket

Overfilling the air fryer basket can also lead to overheating. When you pack too much food into the basket, it restricts air circulation around the food and within the cooking chamber. This traps heat, causing the appliance to overheat faster than usual. The heating element works harder, and the fan struggles to distribute air. This scenario often triggers the automatic shut-off. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for maximum food capacity. Leave enough space for air to circulate freely around the food. This not only prevents overheating but also ensures your food cooks evenly and crisply. If your air fryer seems to turn on but fails to heat up, overfilling or blockages could be a factor. For specific heating issues, this resource might be helpful: [Why is My Gourmia Air Fryer Not Heating Up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-gourmia-air-fryer-not-heating-up).

Understanding these safety features helps you avoid triggering them unintentionally. Proper loading and ensuring clear vents are key steps to prevent your Gourmia air fryer from stopping due to overheating. Remember, safety features are there to protect you and your appliance.

### 3. Common Component Failures: When Parts Fail in Your Gourmia Air Fryer

Even with proper care, electronic appliances can experience component failures. When your **Gourmia air fryer stopped working**, a specific part might have broken down. Identifying which component failed can be difficult without technical knowledge. However, knowing the most common failures helps in understanding the issue.

#### Heating Element Malfunction

The heating element is crucial for cooking. It generates the high temperatures needed to air fry food. If this element fails, your air fryer might turn on and the fan might run, but it will not produce heat. You might notice the display working fine, but the temperature inside remains cool. This typically indicates a faulty heating element. Heating elements can burn out over time due to wear and tear. A broken heating element usually requires replacement by a qualified technician. This is not a repair for the average user.

#### Fan Motor Issues

The fan circulates hot air evenly around the food. It ensures consistent cooking and helps prevent hot spots. If the fan motor fails, the air fryer will not cook effectively, and it might overheat. You might hear strange noises, or no fan noise at all, when the unit is running. Without proper air circulation, the air fryer's safety mechanism might trigger, causing it to shut down. A failing fan motor often means your air fryer stopped working effectively. The motor could be burnt out, or the fan blades might be obstructed. Cleaning any debris from the fan area might help, but a faulty motor needs professional repair.

#### Control Panel or Display Problems

The control panel is your interface with the air fryer. It includes buttons, touch sensors, and the digital display. Issues with the control panel can range from unresponsive buttons to a blank or flickering display. If the control panel fails, you cannot set cooking times or temperatures. This effectively makes the air fryer unusable. Sometimes, a power surge can damage the control board. Other times, liquid spills or general wear can cause problems. If your display is dark or buttons do not respond, the control panel could be the reason why your **Gourmia air fryer stopped working**.

#### Basket or Tray Detection Switch

Many air fryers have a safety switch that detects if the basket or tray is fully inserted. This prevents the appliance from operating if the basket is not secure. This switch is typically located behind the basket opening. If this switch is faulty or misaligned, the air fryer might not turn on, even if the basket is pushed in correctly. The air fryer thinks the basket is not present, thus preventing operation for safety reasons. Check that the basket slides in smoothly and locks into place. Sometimes, a small food particle might be blocking the switch. Ensure the basket is clean and properly seated. If the Gourmia air fryer is not working at all, checking the basket connection is a good troubleshooting step.
