Beyond air frying, the toaster oven functions are important. Gourmia models toast bread, bagels, and pastries. They usually have a toast shade selector. This lets you choose how light or dark your toast becomes. I find the toasting consistent across the rack. This avoids burnt edges or pale spots.

Baking performance is also good for a compact oven. You can bake cookies, small pizzas, and casseroles. The oven maintains temperature well. This is important for successful baking. It saves you from heating a large traditional oven for small batches. This saves energy.
