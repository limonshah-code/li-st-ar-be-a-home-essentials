### Takeaway

*   **Check for Clogs First:** Most drainage issues stem from food debris in the filter, sump, or drain hose.
*   **Inspect the Drain Path:** Look for kinks in the hose or blockages in the air gap or garbage disposal.
*   **Evaluate the Drain Pump:** Listen for unusual noises or test the pump's function if clogs are absent.
*   **Consider Electrical Issues:** Ensure the dishwasher receives power and the control board functions correctly.
*   **Maintain Regularly:** Prevent future problems by routinely cleaning the filter and running maintenance cycles.

A Frigidaire dishwasher that does not drain typically suffers from blockages in its drainage system, such as a clogged filter, sump, or drain hose. Other causes include a malfunctioning drain pump, a faulty check valve, or electrical issues affecting the control board or pump operation. Proper installation, including a high drain loop and removing a garbage disposal knock-out plug, also plays a key role.

### Clogged Drain Filter and Sump: A Common Frigidaire Dishwasher Drainage Culprit

One of the most frequent reasons your Frigidaire dishwasher is not draining is a clogged filter or sump area. Over time, food particles, grease, and even small pieces of broken glass can accumulate in these components. This buildup obstructs the flow of water, preventing it from exiting the wash tub effectively. Think of it like a dam preventing a river from flowing; the water simply has nowhere to go.

Regular cleaning of these parts is a simple yet crucial maintenance step. Many people overlook this task until a drainage problem arises. However, if you want to keep your dishwasher running smoothly, it needs attention. I find that a quick check every few weeks prevents most of these common blockages.

#### Locating and Cleaning the Filter

Your Frigidaire dishwasher has a removable filter system, usually located at the bottom of the wash tub. This filter traps larger food debris to prevent it from reaching the drain pump. If this filter becomes caked with food particles, water struggles to pass through it to the drain.

To clean it, you first need to remove the lower dish rack to gain full access. Most Frigidaire models have a cylindrical filter that twists counter-clockwise to unlock, and then you lift it out. Some may have a two-part filter, with a larger coarse filter and a finer micro-filter beneath it. Carefully pull out both sections. Rinse the filter under running water, scrubbing away any stuck-on food with a brush or sponge. You will be surprised at how much gunk can collect there. A good scrub ensures clear passages for water. For detailed steps on clearing this area, you might find this guide on [how to clean Frigidaire dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-frigidaire-dishwasher-drain) very helpful.

#### Cleaning the Sump Area

Once the filter is out, you can access the sump area. This is the recessed basin at the bottom of the dishwasher where water collects before being pumped out. Look for any visible food debris, broken glass, or small objects like twist ties or plastic fragments. These items can block the drain opening or interfere with the drain pump impeller.

Use a paper towel or a wet/dry vacuum to carefully remove any standing water. Then, with a flashlight, inspect the area thoroughly. Reach in with a gloved hand to feel for hidden obstructions. Be cautious, as there might be sharp objects. Clearing this area ensures that water has a clear path once it passes through the filter. Keeping this part clean is essential for proper function. This general advice on [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain) can also apply to your Frigidaire.

### Addressing a Blocked Drain Hose or Air Gap in Your Frigidaire

After checking the internal filters and sump, the next logical step when your Frigidaire dishwasher is not draining is to inspect the drain hose and the air gap. These components carry the water away from the appliance to your home's plumbing system. Blockages or improper installation in either of these can easily stop the drainage process. A kinked hose or a clogged air gap acts like a stopper, keeping water trapped inside.

This step involves looking outside the dishwasher's immediate interior. It means checking the connections and the path water takes after it leaves the tub. Many times, the problem is not inside the dishwasher itself, but rather in the plumbing it connects to. This is where a little investigation can save you a service call.

#### Inspecting the Drain Hose

The drain hose connects your dishwasher to your sink's drainpipe or a garbage disposal unit. It runs from the back of the dishwasher to under your kitchen sink. Common issues include kinks, clogs, or improper installation. First, pull the dishwasher out slightly if possible, or look under the sink. Examine the entire length of the hose for any visible bends or kinks that could restrict water flow. If you find one, simply straighten it out.

Next, disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain or garbage disposal. Place the end of the hose in a bucket. Then, run a short drain cycle on your dishwasher. If water flows freely into the bucket, the problem is likely in your sink's drain or disposal, not the hose itself. If water still does not drain, the hose might be clogged internally. You can try to clear it using a mixture of baking soda and vinegar, followed by hot water, or by snaking it with a plumber's snake. Sometimes, simply disconnecting it and blowing through it can dislodge minor blockages. This guide on [how to get the dishwasher to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain) provides broader context for drainage issues.

#### Checking the Air Gap (if present)

Some plumbing codes require an air gap for dishwashers, especially in areas with certain building regulations. An air gap is a small, cylindrical fitting usually located on top of your kitchen sink or countertop, near the faucet. It prevents contaminated sink water from siphoning back into your dishwasher. If you have an air gap, it will have two hoses connected to it: one from the dishwasher and one leading to the garbage disposal or sink drain.

These units can become clogged with food debris, preventing proper drainage. To check it, unscrew the cover and cap from the air gap. Look for any visible obstructions. You might need to use a small brush or a wire to clear out any debris. Once cleared, replace the cap and cover. If your Frigidaire dishwasher still doesn't drain after this, you know the air gap isn't the problem. Always ensure the air gap is clear if your setup includes one.

### Diagnosing a Faulty Drain Pump in Your Frigidaire Dishwasher

If your Frigidaire dishwasher is not draining and you have ruled out clogs in the filter, sump, hose, and air gap, the drain pump becomes a prime suspect. The drain pump is the motor that actively pushes the water out of the dishwasher. Without a functioning pump, the water has no way to exit the machine, leaving you with a standing pool after the wash cycle.

Drain pumps can fail for a few reasons. Sometimes, they simply wear out over time. Other times, hard objects like broken glass, fruit pits, or even small bones can get past the filter and jam the pump's impeller. A jammed impeller can prevent the motor from turning, or it might cause the motor to burn out. Identifying if your drain pump is the issue is crucial for effective troubleshooting.

#### Signs of a Failing Drain Pump

There are several tell-tale signs that your Frigidaire dishwasher's drain pump might be failing. First, listen closely to your dishwasher during the drain cycle. A healthy drain pump makes a distinct humming or whirring sound as it expels water. If you hear no sound at all during the drain portion of the cycle, it could indicate the pump is not receiving power or is completely dead.

Conversely, you might hear unusual noises. A grinding, buzzing, or loud humming sound without water draining suggests that the pump is trying to work but is either jammed or failing. This sound often means the motor is running, but the impeller cannot spin freely due to an obstruction or internal damage. Another sign is if the dishwasher completes the wash cycle but the water remains, and you hear no draining sounds at the end. In some cases, a partial drain might occur, but not a complete one, indicating a weak or partially obstructed pump. This can give you clues as to [how do you drain a Frigidaire dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-you-drain-a-frigidaire-dishwasher) manually, while you diagnose the pump.

#### Testing the Drain Pump

Testing the drain pump involves some technical steps, often requiring you to access the underside of your dishwasher. **Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before attempting any internal repairs or inspections.** First, you will need to carefully tilt the dishwasher back or pull it out to access the components underneath. Locate the drain pump, which is typically attached to the wash motor or separate from it, usually near the drain hose connection.

Once you find the pump, look for any visible obstructions around the impeller, which is the fan-like component that pushes water. Small objects can get wrapped around it. You can try to clear it manually. If the impeller seems clear, you might need to use a multimeter to test the pump's electrical continuity or resistance. This step confirms if the pump is receiving power and if its internal windings are intact. If the pump shows no continuity or incorrect resistance readings, it likely needs replacement. Replacing a drain pump can be a moderately complex DIY task, but it is achievable with the right tools and patience. This resource on [how to test Frigidaire dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-frigidaire-dishwasher-drain-pump) offers specific guidance for your model.

### Understanding the Check Valve: Another Frigidaire Drainage Obstacle

Beyond clogs and pump issues, a faulty check valve can also prevent your Frigidaire dishwasher from draining properly. The check valve is a small, one-way valve designed to prevent dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher tub once it has been pumped out. It acts as a gate, opening to allow water to exit and closing to prevent re-entry. If this valve gets stuck in a closed position or becomes obstructed, water cannot exit the dishwasher at all.

This component often gets overlooked during initial troubleshooting, but it plays a critical role in the drainage system. A stuck check valve means the water has nowhere to go, even if the drain pump is working perfectly. It's like trying to push water through a closed pipe. Understanding its function helps pinpoint the problem accurately.

#### Purpose of the Check Valve

The primary purpose of the check valve is to maintain hygiene within your dishwasher. Without it, water that has already been pumped into the drain line or garbage disposal could flow back into the dishwasher tub. This would re-contaminate your supposedly clean dishes with dirty water and food particles. The check valve usually consists of a small flap or ball inside a housing that opens under pressure from the draining water and then closes once the pressure drops.

Think of it as a one-way street for water. When the drain pump pushes water out, the valve opens. Once the pump stops, the valve snaps shut, sealing off the path back into the dishwasher. This simple mechanism is essential for efficient and sanitary operation. A broken or clogged check valve compromises this entire process.

#### How to Inspect and Clear

The check valve is typically located near the drain pump or at the end of the drain hose connection point inside the dishwasher. To access it, you will likely need to remove the lower spray arm and possibly the drain pump housing or sump cover. **Remember to always disconnect the power to your dishwasher before starting any inspection or repair.** Once you locate the check valve, inspect it for any visible debris that might be preventing it from opening or closing. Food particles, small bits of plastic, or even mineral deposits can cause it to stick.

You can often clean the check valve by simply removing the debris. Some check valves are integrated into the pump or sump assembly, requiring careful disassembly. If the valve mechanism itself appears broken, bent, or if the flap is missing, then the check valve needs replacement. This is a relatively inexpensive part, and replacing it can often resolve drainage issues that are not due to clogs or pump failure.

### When Electronics Fail: Control Board and Sensor Issues

While mechanical problems like clogs and pump failures are common, sometimes your Frigidaire dishwasher is not draining due to a deeper electrical issue. The control board acts as the "brain" of the dishwasher, sending signals to all the components, including the drain pump. If this board malfunctions, it might not send the correct signal to initiate the drain cycle. Similarly, a faulty water level sensor can trick the dishwasher into thinking there is no water to drain, or too much, leading to incorrect cycle behavior.

These electronic components are complex and less intuitive to diagnose than a simple clog. However, they are essential for the proper functioning of your appliance. When your dishwasher seems fine otherwise but just will not drain, electronic issues are worth considering. This often means the problem is not a physical blockage but a command that is never given or wrongly interpreted.

#### The Role of the Control Board

The control board is a circuit board with microprocessors and relays. It manages every aspect of the dishwasher cycle, from filling and washing to rinsing and draining. During the drain phase, the control board sends an electrical signal to the drain pump, telling it to activate and expel water. If this signal is interrupted or never sent due to a fault on the board, the drain pump will not run.

Signs of a failing control board can include erratic behavior, such as cycles not completing, lights flashing strangely, or the dishwasher not responding to commands. Sometimes, a power surge or simple wear and tear can damage the board. Diagnosing a faulty control board often requires advanced electrical testing and is typically a job for a professional technician. However, a simple reset of the dishwasher by unplugging it for a few minutes (or flipping the circuit breaker) can sometimes resolve temporary glitches. If your Frigidaire dishwasher won't drain and you suspect an electrical issue, a reset is always the first, safest step.

#### Water Level Sensor Problems

Many dishwashers, including Frigidaire models, use a water level sensor (also known as a float switch or turbidity sensor). This sensor detects how much water is in the tub. It plays a crucial role in preventing overflows and ensuring the correct amount of water for each cycle. In terms of drainage, if the sensor incorrectly indicates a low water level or malfunctions, the control board might not activate the drain pump because it "thinks" there is no water to remove.

Conversely, if the sensor is stuck or thinks the tub is constantly full, it might trigger an error code or try to drain continuously, but fail if the pump is not engaged properly. These sensors can get coated with detergent residue or mineral deposits, leading to inaccurate readings. Cleaning the sensor, if accessible, might resolve the issue. However, replacement is often necessary if the sensor is truly faulty. When your [Frigidaire dishwasher won't drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-my-frigidaire-dishwasher-wont-drain) and you have checked all mechanical components, consider these electronic possibilities.

### Installation Errors: High Loop and Garbage Disposal Concerns

Sometimes, the reason your Frigidaire dishwasher is not draining has nothing to do with internal parts or clogs, but rather with how it was installed. Two common installation errors can directly impact drainage: the absence of a proper high drain loop and issues related to connection with a garbage disposal. These are often overlooked, especially in newly installed dishwashers or after kitchen renovations.

These are problems that you cannot fix by cleaning a filter or replacing a pump. They require inspecting the plumbing setup behind and under your sink. Understanding these setup requirements can save you from unnecessary repairs to your appliance itself. It is all about ensuring the water has an unobstructed and correctly structured path out of the machine.

#### Ensuring Proper Drain Hose High Loop

A crucial part of dishwasher installation is creating a "high loop" in the drain hose. This means routing the drain hose up high under the sink, typically attaching it to the underside of the countertop, before it descends to connect to the sink drain or garbage disposal. The highest point of this loop should be above the flood level rim of the sink. This simple loop prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher due to siphoning. It also prevents water from draining out of the dishwasher prematurely during a cycle.

If your Frigidaire dishwasher's drain hose does not have a high loop, water can backflow into the tub, making it seem like the dishwasher is not draining properly. In reality, it might be draining but then refilling with sink water. Check under your sink to see if the drain hose forms this upward loop. If not, you can often fix it by securing the hose with a clamp or zip tie to the underside of your counter or cabinet. This simple adjustment ensures that gravity and suction work in your favor, not against you. Proper installation is key to preventing many common drainage issues and helps [get the dishwasher to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain) effectively.

#### Garbage Disposal Knock-Out Plug

If your Frigidaire dishwasher is connected to a new garbage disposal, a very common and easily fixable installation error is forgetting to remove the knock-out plug. When garbage disposals are manufactured, they come with a small plastic plug blocking the dishwasher drain inlet. This plug must be removed before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. If it is not removed, water from the dishwasher will hit a solid barrier and have no way to enter the disposal, thus preventing drainage.

This is a mistake frequently made during DIY installations or by inexperienced plumbers. To check for this, disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the garbage disposal. Look inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet port. If you see a plug, you will need to knock it out. You can usually do this by gently tapping it with a screwdriver and hammer from the inside of the disposal. Once removed, reconnect the drain hose securely. This simple step often resolves "no drain" issues immediately, especially after a new garbage disposal installation.

### Power Problems: Don't Overlook Electrical Supply for Drainage

When your Frigidaire dishwasher is not draining, after checking all the mechanical and plumbing components, you should consider the power supply. A dishwasher, like any appliance, needs consistent and correct electrical power to operate all its functions, including the drain pump. Without adequate power, the pump simply cannot do its job, leaving water in the tub.

Sometimes the issue is not with the dishwasher itself, but with the power it receives from your home's electrical system. This can be an easy fix or indicate a broader electrical problem in your kitchen. It is always wise to rule out power supply issues before digging into more complex internal diagnostics. A simple check can save you time and effort.

#### Checking the Circuit Breaker

The first and easiest electrical check is your home's circuit breaker. Dishwashers are typically on their own dedicated circuit, or sometimes shared with other kitchen outlets. If the circuit breaker tripped, the dishwasher will lose power entirely. This means no lights, no sounds, and definitely no draining.

Go to your home's electrical panel. Find the circuit breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. It might be in the "off" position or in a middle, "tripped" position. Firmly push it to the "off" position first, then flip it completely to the "on" position. Sometimes, resetting a tripped breaker is all it takes to restore power and allow the drain pump to function. A breaker can trip due to an overload, a short circuit, or simply a temporary power surge. If it trips repeatedly, however, it indicates a more serious electrical problem that requires a professional electrician.

#### Power Issues and Appliance Function

Even if the circuit breaker is on, other power-related issues could be at play. Loose wiring connections at the outlet or inside the dishwasher's terminal block can disrupt power flow to specific components like the drain pump. While checking internal wiring requires caution and electrical knowledge, ensuring the dishwasher is fully plugged into a working outlet is a quick verification. You can test the outlet by plugging in another small appliance, like a phone charger or a lamp.

If the dishwasher lights up, powers on, and performs other functions but just does not drain, the power issue is likely more localized to the drain pump itself (e.g., a faulty pump motor winding) rather than a complete power outage to the machine. However, intermittent power supply or low voltage could still impact the pump's ability to operate effectively. Always confirm the dishwasher is receiving stable power before diving into component replacement.

### Conclusion: Regaining Control Over Your Frigidaire's Drainage

Experiencing a Frigidaire dishwasher not draining can certainly disrupt your kitchen routine and lead to a pile-up of dirty dishes. However, as we have explored, most of these drainage problems have common, identifiable causes, many of which you can resolve without needing professional help. From simple food clogs in the filter and sump to blockages in the drain hose or air gap, many issues stem from easily accessible components. Even more complex problems like a faulty drain pump, a sticking check valve, or electrical hiccups with the control board or sensor often present clear signs once you know what to look for.

I encourage you to take a methodical approach, starting with the simplest solutions first. Always remember to prioritize safety by disconnecting power before any inspection or repair. Regular maintenance, such as cleaning your filter and inspecting the drain hose, goes a long way in preventing future drainage woes. By understanding "what would cause a Frigidaire dishwasher not to drain," you gain the power to troubleshoot effectively. If you have worked through these steps and your Frigidaire dishwasher is still not draining, it might be time to call a qualified appliance technician. They can diagnose more intricate issues or safely replace faulty components, getting your dishwasher back to its sparkling, draining best.
