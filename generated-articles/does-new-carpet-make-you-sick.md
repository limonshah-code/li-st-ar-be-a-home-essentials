### Does new carpet make you sick?

Yes, new carpet can potentially make some people sick due to the release of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). These chemicals, part of the "new carpet smell," can cause symptoms like headaches, dizziness, nausea, and respiratory irritation, especially in sensitive individuals or in poorly ventilated spaces.

## The 'New Carpet Smell' and What It Means for Your Health

We all recognize the unique scent of a freshly carpeted room. Many people describe this as the "new carpet smell." This smell is not just the scent of clean fibers. It comes from various chemicals released into the air. These chemicals are called Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOCs.

Carpet manufacturers use these compounds in many parts of the carpet. They are in the carpet fibers, the backing materials, and the adhesives. When you unroll new carpet, these VOCs start to evaporate into your home's air. This process is known as off-gassing. Off-gassing is common for many new products, not just carpets.

The intensity of the smell and the off-gassing can vary. It depends on the type of carpet and its components. Higher quality or natural fiber carpets may have less off-gassing. However, any new carpet will release some amount of VOCs initially. It is important to know that [is new carpet smell safe](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-new-carpet-smell-safe) is a common concern.

Understanding this smell is the first step. It helps us understand why new carpet can sometimes make you feel unwell. The good news is that this off-gassing typically reduces over time. However, it can still pose a risk to health during the initial period.

## Understanding Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Carpet Materials

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are gases emitted from certain solids or liquids. You can find many different VOCs in new carpet. These chemicals contribute to indoor air pollution. They can affect your health.

One common VOC found in carpet is 4-PC (4-phenylcyclohexene). This chemical is often used in the styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) latex backing of carpets. It gives off a strong, distinct odor. Other VOCs might include formaldehyde, benzene, and toluene. These chemicals come from dyes, adhesives, and stain-resistant treatments. Formaldehyde, for instance, is often used as a binder or adhesive. It can also be present in the carpet's backing.

The effects of these VOCs on your health depend on several factors. These factors include the type of chemical, the concentration in the air, and how long you are exposed. Your personal sensitivity also plays a big role. Some people are more sensitive to these chemicals than others. Young children, the elderly, and people with existing respiratory issues are often more vulnerable.

The goal is always to minimize exposure to these compounds. This helps to maintain good indoor air quality. By choosing materials carefully, you can create a safer home. You can also take steps during and after installation.

## Common Symptoms When New Carpet Causes Sickness

When new carpet off-gasses VOCs, it can trigger various symptoms. These symptoms usually appear shortly after installation. They can range from mild discomfort to more noticeable health issues. Knowing these signs helps you understand if new carpet makes you sick.

Many people report respiratory irritation. This includes a sore throat, coughing, or difficulty breathing. The VOCs can irritate the delicate lining of your airways. If you have asthma or allergies, these symptoms might be worse. You might also experience eye irritation. This can cause watery, itchy, or red eyes. A runny nose or sneezing is also common.

Headaches are another very common symptom. Some people describe them as mild, while others experience more severe head pain. Dizziness and lightheadedness can also occur. Nausea and an upset stomach are other possible reactions to prolonged exposure. In some cases, skin irritation may develop. This might show as a rash or itching on exposed skin.

These symptoms often subside once the air clears. This happens as the off-gassing decreases. However, it is important to take steps to reduce your exposure. If symptoms persist or worsen, you should consult a doctor.

## Mitigating Off-Gassing: Practical Steps for a Healthier Home

You can take several effective steps to reduce off-gassing from new carpet. These actions help clear the air. They create a healthier living space for you and your family. The main goal is to promote good ventilation.

First, ventilate your home thoroughly. Open windows and doors wide during and after installation. Use fans to move air from inside to outside. Keep this ventilation going for at least 72 hours, or even longer if the smell persists. This helps VOCs escape your home.

Second, consider using activated charcoal or baking soda. These natural absorbents can help neutralize odors. Spread a generous layer of baking soda over the new carpet. Let it sit for several hours, then vacuum it up completely. Activated charcoal can be placed in open containers around the room. It works to absorb airborne chemicals.

Third, air purifiers can be a beneficial addition. Look for purifiers that specifically target VOCs. These often use activated carbon filters. They can help clean the air more actively. While not a substitute for ventilation, an air purifier offers continuous support.

Finally, think about airing out the carpet before installation. If possible, unroll the new carpet in a garage or well-ventilated area for a few days. This allows some initial off-gassing to happen outside your home. These steps help ensure your new carpet brings comfort, not sickness. Taking these precautions is also part of learning [how to protect new carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-protect-new-carpet) from potential issues.

## Choosing Healthier Carpet Options for Your Living Space

Making smart choices about your carpet can significantly reduce VOC exposure. Many manufacturers now offer healthier alternatives. You do not have to compromise on style or comfort. You can still create a safe environment.

Look for carpets with the Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) Green Label Plus certification. This certification means the carpet meets strict standards for low VOC emissions. It is a reliable indicator of a healthier product. Brands proudly display this label on their products. This makes it easy for you to identify them.

Consider carpets made from natural fibers. Wool, sisal, jute, and cotton are excellent choices. These materials naturally have fewer synthetic chemicals. They tend to off-gas less than their synthetic counterparts. Wool, for example, is durable, renewable, and naturally flame-resistant. It also acts as a natural air filter.

Pay attention to the carpet backing and adhesives. Many VOCs come from these components. Seek out carpets with natural latex or recycled content backings. Opt for low-VOC or zero-VOC adhesives if glues are used during installation. Always ask your carpet dealer about these specific details. They can guide you to the best options for a healthy home. Making informed decisions helps you avoid the problem of new carpet making you sick.

## Installation Best Practices to Prevent Sickness from New Carpet

Proper installation plays a crucial role in minimizing potential health issues from new carpet. How carpet is installed can impact off-gassing and indoor air quality. It is important to follow specific steps. This helps ensure your new carpet is a healthy addition.

First, professional installation is always recommended. Experienced installers know how to handle carpet materials. They often use techniques that minimize VOC exposure. They can advise on proper subfloor preparation. They also ensure a tight, secure fit. This reduces the need for excessive adhesives.

Second, ensure maximum ventilation during the installation process. Keep windows and doors open. Use exhaust fans to draw air out of the room. This helps to dissipate VOCs as they are released. It prevents them from building up in the air. This step is critical for both the installers and your family.

Third, if practical, unroll the new carpet outside for a day or two before installation. This "airing out" period allows a significant portion of off-gassing to occur outdoors. This reduces the concentration of VOCs inside your home. It makes the indoor air much safer.

Finally, continue to ventilate the room for several days after the carpet is laid. You can also place furniture carefully. While you might be eager to [put furniture on new carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-put-furniture-on-new-carpet) or [put a bed on new carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-put-bed-on-new-carpet), remember to prioritize air circulation. Keeping windows slightly ajar and running fans helps the remaining VOCs escape. These practices significantly reduce the chances of new carpet making you sick.

## Long-Term Carpet Care and Indoor Air Quality

Even after the initial off-gassing period, maintaining your carpet properly impacts indoor air quality. Regular care ensures your carpet remains a healthy part of your home. It prevents other issues that could affect your well-being. Proper cleaning removes trapped pollutants.

First, regular vacuuming is essential. Use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter. This type of filter traps fine particles, dust, and allergens. Vacuum at least once or twice a week, more often in high-traffic areas or if you have pets. This prevents the build-up of dirt and potential irritants within the carpet fibers.

Second, address spills and stains immediately. Use appropriate, gentle cleaning solutions. Harsh chemical cleaners can introduce new VOCs into your home. Always test cleaners in an inconspicuous area first. Prompt cleaning prevents stains from setting and becoming harder to remove. This also keeps mold and mildew from forming if moisture remains.

Third, consider professional carpet cleaning at least once a year. Professionals use powerful equipment. They can deep clean your carpet more effectively than home methods. They extract dirt, allergens, and residues. Be sure to ask about their cleaning methods and solutions. Many services offer green or low-VOC cleaning options.
