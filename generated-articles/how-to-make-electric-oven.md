First, securely mount your heating elements inside the inner oven cavity. Ensure they do not touch the walls. They need space for air circulation. Use ceramic standoffs or brackets designed for high temperatures. Wire the heating elements in parallel to your power source. This ensures each element receives full voltage.

Use high-temperature silicone-insulated wires for all connections to the elements. Crimp connections tightly with appropriate connectors. Cover exposed wire ends with ceramic caps or heat shrink tubing. Make sure connections are robust and can withstand oven vibrations and heat cycles. Pay attention to the wattage and voltage ratings of your elements. Ensure they match your power supply.

### Integrating the Thermostat

The thermostat controls the oven's temperature. Place the thermostat's sensing bulb or probe inside the oven cavity. It should be away from direct contact with heating elements. This provides an accurate temperature reading. Wire the thermostat in series with your heating elements. When the oven reaches the set temperature, the thermostat breaks the circuit. This turns the elements off.

When the temperature drops, it reconnects the circuit. This turns the elements back on. This cycle maintains a consistent oven temperature. Use high-temperature wire for all thermostat connections. Ensure all electrical connections are secure and insulated. Properly integrating the thermostat is key to precise temperature control.

### Safety Circuitry

Implementing safety circuitry is non-negotiable. This protects against overloads and short circuits. Install an appropriate circuit breaker or fuse directly in the main power line. This device will trip if the current drawn by the oven exceeds safe limits. This prevents overheating and potential fires.

Consider adding a thermal cutoff switch. This is a separate safety device. It will permanently break the circuit if the oven reaches an dangerously high temperature. It acts as a last line of defense against runaway heating. Ensure all ground wires are correctly connected to the oven's metal casing. This provides a path for fault currents. It protects against electric shock. Following these safety steps is paramount.
