## Step-by-Step: Removing Your Old AC Panels

Replacing window air conditioner side panels begins with safely removing the old ones. This process is straightforward. However, it requires careful attention to detail. Always prioritize safety first. Disconnecting the power prevents electric shock. Taking your time helps avoid damaging the unit or the window frame.

**Safety First: Disconnect Power**
Before touching your AC unit, unplug it from the wall outlet. This is a critical safety step. Never work on an electrical appliance while it is powered. Confirm the unit is completely off. If your unit is hard-wired, switch off the corresponding circuit breaker at your home's electrical panel.

**Prepare the AC Unit**
You may need to slide the AC unit slightly inward from the window. This gives you better access to the side panels. Some units might require complete removal from the window. However, many panel replacements can happen with the unit mostly in place. Assess your unit's design. If you cannot remove it, you can still clean the unit. For tips on cleaning without removal, consider [how to clean window air conditioner without removing it](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-window-air-conditioner-without-removing-it).

**Locate Fasteners**
Inspect the old side panels. They are usually held in place by screws. These screws secure the panels to the AC unit's frame. Some units may use plastic clips or tabs. Look carefully along the top and bottom edges of the panels. Use your screwdriver to remove any visible screws. Place these screws in a small container. This prevents them from getting lost.

**Carefully Remove Old Panels**
Once the fasteners are loose, gently slide the old panels out of their channels. They might be stiff or brittle from age. Take care not to force them. If they resist, check again for any hidden screws or clips. Sometimes, old sealant or paint can stick them in place. A utility knife can help gently score any stuck edges. Once removed, discard the old panels. They are no longer useful.

**Clean the Area**
With the old panels gone, clean the exposed channels and the window frame. Dust, dirt, and insect debris often accumulate here. Use a damp cloth to wipe down surfaces. A vacuum cleaner attachment can remove loose particles. This creates a clean surface for your new panels and ensures a better seal. A clean area improves the performance of new materials.

## Installing the New Window AC Side Panels

Now that the old panels are gone and the area is clean, it is time to install the new window air conditioner side panels. This process mirrors the removal in reverse.

A proper fit makes a big difference in performance.

**Slide New Panels into Channels**
Take one of your new side panels. Carefully align its edges with the top and bottom channels on your AC unit. These are the grooves where the old panel slid out. Gently slide the new panel into these channels. It should move smoothly. If it resists, do not force it. Re-check the alignment or ensure there is no debris blocking the channel. Repeat this step for the other side panel.

**Extend and Position the AC Unit**
Once both panels are loosely in place, carefully slide your AC unit back into the window opening. Extend the new side panels outwards to meet the window frame. The accordion panels should stretch to fill the gap. Ensure the AC unit is level and securely resting on the window sill. This proper positioning ensures the panels align correctly with the window frame.

**Secure the Panels**
Once the panels are extended and positioned against the window frame, it is time to secure them. Use the screws you removed earlier, or new screws if provided with your replacement panels. Drive the screws through the designated holes in the panels and into the AC unit's frame. Make sure the screws are tight but do not overtighten. Overtightening can strip the holes or crack the new panels.

**Perform an Initial Seal Check**
After securing the panels, do a quick visual check. Ensure there are no large gaps between the panels and the window frame. Also, check where the panels meet the AC unit itself. The goal is a snug fit. This initial check helps identify any areas that might need further sealing later. A good installation provides a solid foundation for additional insulation.
