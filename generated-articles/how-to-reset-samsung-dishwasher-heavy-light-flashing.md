## Checking for Drainage and Filtration Issues

Many dishwasher problems relate to drainage. A flashing "Heavy" light frequently points to a clog. Food particles, grease, or other debris can block water flow. This prevents the dishwasher from emptying properly.

Your Samsung dishwasher has a filter system designed to catch debris. Over time, this filter can become dirty. A clogged filter restricts water flow. This can lead to error lights and poor cleaning performance. Regular cleaning prevents many issues.

### Inspecting and Cleaning the Dishwasher Filter

The dishwasher filter is located at the bottom of the wash tub. It catches food bits and debris. A dirty filter reduces water pressure. It can also cause drainage problems. Cleaning it is a simple task.

Here are the steps to clean the filter:

1.  **Remove the Bottom Rack:** Pull out the lower dish rack to access the bottom of the dishwasher.
2.  **Locate the Filter Assembly:** Samsung dishwashers usually have a two-part filter system. This includes a cylindrical filter and a flat filter screen. Refer to your dishwasher's manual for exact instructions.
3.  **Twist and Remove Filters:** Twist the cylindrical filter counter-clockwise to unlock it. Lift it out. Then, remove the flat filter screen underneath.
4.  **Clean Under Running Water:** Rinse both filter parts under warm running water. Use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away any stuck-on food. You can use a mild dish soap if needed.
5.  **Check the Filter Housing:** Look inside the filter housing in the dishwasher tub. Remove any visible debris or food particles.
6.  **Reinstall Filters:** Place the flat filter screen back into position. Then, insert the cylindrical filter and twist it clockwise to lock it securely. Ensure it clicks into place.
7.  **Run a Test Cycle:** Close the dishwasher door. Select a short cycle to test if the "Heavy" light is gone.

### Clearing the Drain Hose and Air Gap

Even with a clean filter, clogs can exist further down the line. The drain hose carries wastewater out of the dishwasher. The air gap, if present, prevents drain water from backing up into the dishwasher. Both can get blocked.

A kinked or clogged drain hose stops water from leaving. An obstructed air gap also prevents proper drainage. These issues can trigger the "Heavy" light.

Follow these steps to clear them:

*   **Check the Drain Hose:**
    1.  Pull the dishwasher away from the wall slightly, if possible.
    2.  Locate the drain hose, which typically connects to the sink's drain or garbage disposal.
    3.  Inspect the hose for any visible kinks or bends. Straighten any you find.
    4.  Disconnect the hose from the sink drain or garbage disposal (secure a bucket underneath to catch any water).
    5.  Check inside the hose for blockages. You might need to use a long brush or snake tool to dislodge debris.
    6.  Reconnect the hose securely.
*   **Inspect the Air Gap (if applicable):**
    1.  The air gap is usually a small chrome cylinder on your sink.
    2.  Remove the cap from the air gap.
    3.  Check for any debris or blockages inside. Clear anything you find.
    4.  Reattach the cap.

After clearing the drain hose and air gap, run a test cycle. This checks if the issue is resolved.

## Verifying Water Supply and Inlet Valve

A dishwasher needs a steady supply of water to operate. If the "Heavy" light flashes, it could mean the dishwasher is not getting enough water. This triggers error sensors. The appliance cannot complete its cycle without proper water fill.

Issues with water supply are often simple to fix. It might be a closed valve or a blocked screen. Checking these components is crucial.

### Checking the Water Inlet Valve and Hose

The water inlet valve controls water entry into the dishwasher. The inlet hose delivers water to this valve. If either is faulty or blocked, water cannot get in. This causes the dishwasher to malfunction.

Follow these steps to check them:

1.  **Locate the Water Shut-Off Valve:** This valve is typically under the sink, near the dishwasher. It controls the water supply to the dishwasher.
2.  **Ensure Valve is Open:** Make sure the valve is fully open. Turn it counter-clockwise to ensure water can flow freely.
3.  **Inspect the Inlet Hose:** Check the hose connected to the dishwasher and the shut-off valve. Look for any kinks, twists, or damage. Straighten any kinks you find.
4.  **Check Inlet Screen:** At the connection point to the dishwasher, there is often a small screen. This screen prevents debris from entering the inlet valve. Disconnect the hose from the dishwasher. Inspect this screen for any buildup or clogs. Clean it if necessary with a small brush.
5.  **Reconnect Securely:** Once checked, reconnect the hose firmly. Turn the water supply back on.

If water supply issues persist, the inlet valve itself might be faulty. A faulty valve might not open fully. This restricts water flow. You might need professional help to replace it.

## Addressing the Float Switch and Over-Sudsing

The float switch is a crucial safety component in your dishwasher. It detects the water level inside the tub. If the water level rises too high, the float switch activates the drain pump. It prevents overflows.

If the float switch is stuck or malfunctioning, it can send incorrect signals. It might tell the dishwasher the water level is too high. This happens even if it is not. This can cause the "Heavy" light to flash.

### Inspecting and Cleaning the Float Switch

The float switch is usually a small plastic cap or post at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It moves up and down with the water level. If it gets stuck, it cannot properly sense the water.

Here is how to check it:

1.  **Locate the Float Switch:** Look for a small round or square component. It usually sits near the front of the dishwasher tub's bottom.
2.  **Check for Obstructions:** Ensure no dishes, food debris, or foreign objects are blocking the float switch. It needs to move freely.
3.  **Manually Test Movement:** Gently push the float switch down and release it. It should spring back up easily. If it feels stiff or stuck, try to clean around its base. Use a damp cloth to remove any grime.
4.  **Listen for a Click:** When you push it down, you might hear a faint click. This indicates the switch is engaging.

If the float switch does not move freely or click, it might be faulty. A stuck float switch can cause the dishwasher to incorrectly sense an overflow. This leads to the "Heavy" light flashing.

### Preventing Over-Sudsing

Excessive suds can also cause problems. A large amount of foam can fool the float switch. It rises as if the tub is full of water. This tricks the dishwasher into thinking there is an overflow. The machine then tries to drain constantly. It might also trigger the "Heavy" light.

Over-sudsing usually happens for a few reasons:

*   **Using too much detergent:** More detergent does not mean cleaner dishes. It often means more suds.
*   **Using the wrong type of detergent:** Always use dishwasher-specific detergent. Hand dish soap creates too many suds.
*   **Rinsing dishes too thoroughly:** Pre-rinsing dishes excessively can leave less food grime for the detergent to work on. This can also lead to more sudsing. Modern detergents are formulated to work with some food particles.

To fix over-sudsing:

1.  **Reduce Detergent:** Use only the recommended amount of dishwasher detergent. Check the detergent dispenser for proper fill lines.
2.  **Use Proper Detergent:** Ensure you are using automatic dishwasher detergent. Never use liquid hand dish soap.
3.  **Add Salt (if applicable):** Some areas have hard water. Hard water can affect detergent performance. If your dishwasher has a salt dispenser, use dishwasher salt to soften the water.
4.  **Run a Rinse Cycle:** If suds are present, run a "Rinse Only" cycle without any detergent. This can help clear the excess suds. You may need to repeat this.

If your Samsung dishwasher is flashing other lights or making noises, like the "Normal" light flashing and beeping, similar troubleshooting steps might apply.

## Checking Spray Arms and Internal Components

The spray arms distribute water during the wash cycle. They have small holes that spray water under pressure. If these holes are blocked, water distribution suffers. This impacts cleaning performance. It can also affect water flow sensors.

Over time, food particles or mineral deposits can clog these spray arm holes. This leads to uneven washing. It might also contribute to the "Heavy" light flashing.

### Cleaning the Spray Arms

Cleaning the spray arms is a quick maintenance task. It improves dishwasher performance. It helps ensure proper water circulation.

Here is how to clean them:

1.  **Remove Spray Arms:** Gently pull or unscrew the upper and lower spray arms. They usually unclip or twist off. Refer to your manual for specific removal instructions.
2.  **Rinse Under Water:** Hold the spray arms under running water. Check if water flows freely through all the holes.
3.  **Clear Clogs:** Use a small pick, toothpick, or straightened paper clip to clear any blocked holes. Push out any debris you find.
4.  **Reattach Spray Arms:** Once clean, snap or screw the spray arms back into place. Ensure they spin freely.

Proper water flow from the spray arms is essential. It helps the dishwasher sense water levels correctly. It also ensures effective cleaning.

## When to Call a Professional

You have tried all the steps, but the "Heavy" light is still flashing. This means the problem is more complex. It might involve a faulty component. Professional repair might be necessary.

Some issues require specialized tools or knowledge. Attempting complex repairs yourself can cause further damage. It can also void your warranty. Knowing when to call an expert saves time and prevents headaches.

### Recognizing Persistent Issues

If the "Heavy" light continues to flash after all troubleshooting, consider these possibilities:

*   **Faulty Main Control Board:** The control board is the brain of the dishwasher. If it malfunctions, it can send incorrect signals. This causes persistent error lights.
*   **Defective Water Inlet Valve:** Even if you checked the screen, the valve itself could be faulty. It might not open or close correctly.
*   **Broken Drain Pump:** If the drain pump fails, water cannot be expelled. This results in drainage errors and flashing lights.
*   **Sensor Malfunction:** Various sensors monitor water temperature, turbidity, and fill levels. A faulty sensor sends wrong data to the control board.

If you are unsure about diagnosing these components, it is best to seek professional help. A qualified technician can pinpoint the exact cause. They have the tools and experience to fix it safely. They can replace components correctly.
