We will look at the control panel, understand the buttons, and discuss when to unplug the unit. You will learn about automatic shutdown features and how to handle any power-off issues. We also share tips for caring for your Breville oven after use.

### Takeaway

*   Unplug the power cord from the wall outlet for complete power disconnection and safety.
*   Allow the oven to cool down before handling or storing it.
*   Understand automatic shutdown features for safe cooking.

To turn off your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro, press and hold the START/CANCEL button until the display darkens completely. For complete power removal, unplug the power cord from the wall outlet after the oven cools. This ensures all functions stop and the appliance uses no standby power.

### Understanding Your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro's Controls

Your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro is a smart appliance. It has a user-friendly control panel. Knowing how each part works helps you manage your cooking and power it down correctly. The front panel shows you different cooking settings and time. It also has specific buttons for operation.

The main display shows you temperature, time, and cooking functions. You can see what the oven is doing at a glance. Dials let you adjust settings easily. This system makes cooking simple and intuitive.

#### The Display and Dial Functions

The digital display on your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro is a central part of its operation. It shows you the current cooking mode, temperature, and remaining time. You use the selection dial to scroll through different cooking functions like toast, bake, roast, or air fry. The temperature dial lets you set your desired heat level. The time dial adjusts how long your food cooks. Each adjustment updates the display. Understanding these controls helps you manage your cooking tasks. They also help you know when a cycle is complete.

#### Identifying the START/CANCEL Button

The START/CANCEL button is very important. It usually sits on the right side of the control panel. This button starts a cooking cycle. It also stops it. When you press it, the oven begins its chosen function. When you press it again, it can pause or cancel the current operation. For turning off the oven entirely, this button is your primary control. Finding this button quickly helps you manage your cooking. It also helps you safely power down your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro.

### The Primary Method: Using the START/CANCEL Button

Turning off your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro usually involves a simple press of a button. This method is the most common way to stop a cooking cycle or power down the oven after use. It works similar to turning off many other small kitchen appliances. The START/CANCEL button serves a dual purpose. It initiates cooking and also acts as your main off switch.

When your food finishes cooking, the oven usually beeps to alert you. The display may show "End" or return to a standby screen. At this point, you can simply remove your food. If you want to completely turn off the oven's active state, the START/CANCEL button is what you need.

#### Step-by-Step Shutdown

To turn off your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro using the START/CANCEL button, follow these easy steps:

1.  **Finish your cooking cycle:** Wait for the oven to complete its programmed cooking time. It will usually beep several times to signal completion.
2.  **Locate the START/CANCEL button:** This button is typically on the lower right side of the control panel, below the main display.
3.  **Press and hold the button:** Press the START/CANCEL button and hold it down for a few seconds. Do not just tap it.
4.  **Observe the display:** The display panel should dim or turn off completely. Any active heating elements or fans will stop. This indicates the oven has powered down from its operational state.

This method stops the cooking process. It also puts the oven into a low-power standby mode. It is the quickest way to end an operation and silence any active fans or heating.

#### Confirming Power Off

After you press and hold the START/CANCEL button, you should see clear signs the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro has turned off. The digital display will go blank. All internal lights will switch off. You will no longer hear the fan operating. The heating elements will stop glowing. These signs tell you the active cooking functions have ceased. The oven is now in a safe, non-operating state. Always confirm these visual and auditory cues before walking away from the appliance. This ensures it is properly powered down.

### Complete Power Disconnection: Unplugging for Safety

While the START/CANCEL button powers down your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro from active use, it does not always cut off all power. Many modern appliances retain a small amount of standby power when plugged in. For absolute safety, especially after heavy use or before cleaning, unplugging the appliance is essential. This completely disconnects it from the electrical supply. It prevents any accidental activation. It also protects the oven from power surges. Unplugging is a critical step for long-term care and safety.

#### When to Unplug Your Appliance

You should always unplug your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro in specific situations. First, always unplug it after heavy use. This allows the internal components to rest completely. Second, unplug the oven before you begin any cleaning. This prevents electric shock. Third, unplug it if you plan to move the oven. This avoids damage to the cord or appliance. Lastly, if you leave your home for an extended period, unplugging it saves energy. It also removes any risk of electrical issues while you are away. Proper unplugging ensures device longevity and user safety.

#### Safe Unplugging Practices

Unplugging your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro correctly is just as important as knowing how to turn it off. Improper unplugging can damage the cord or outlet. Always grasp the plug head firmly. Never pull the cord itself. Pulling the cord can fray wires inside. This creates a fire hazard. Ensure your hands are dry before touching the plug or outlet. Wet hands increase the risk of electric shock. Give the oven time to cool down before unplugging it. Hot surfaces can burn you. For more information on how hot your oven can get, you can read about [whether the Breville Smart Oven gets hot on the outside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-the-breville-smart-oven-get-hot-on-the-outside). This step prevents burns and ensures safe handling. Store the cord neatly once unplugged. Avoid wrapping it tightly around the oven.

### Automatic Shutdown Features and Their Importance

Your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro comes with built-in automatic shutdown features. These are designed for your safety and convenience. They help prevent overheating and save energy. These features mean the oven will turn itself off under certain conditions. You do not always need to manually press the button. Understanding these features can give you peace of mind. They add an extra layer of protection. This is especially useful if you forget to turn off the oven after cooking.

#### Built-in Timers and Auto-Off

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro has a precise cooking timer. When the timer counts down to zero, the oven typically stops heating. It will also often beep to alert you that the cycle is complete. Many models also have an "auto-off" function that activates after a period of inactivity. For instance, if you set a function but do not start it, or if a cycle finishes and you do not interact with the oven for a certain time, it might enter a standby mode or power down completely. This feature helps prevent wasted energy. It also ensures the appliance is not left running unnecessarily.

#### Overheating Protection

Breville ovens have safety mechanisms to prevent overheating. If the internal temperature of the oven gets too high, a safety sensor will trigger an automatic shutdown. This protects the internal components of the oven from damage. It also reduces the risk of fire. This is a critical safety feature. It acts as a fail-safe. You cannot override this protection. If your oven shuts down unexpectedly during operation, overheating might be the reason. Allow it to cool down completely before attempting to use it again. This built-in safety measure ensures long-term reliability and safe use.

### Troubleshooting Common "Off" Issues

Sometimes, your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro might not turn off as expected. This can be frustrating. It also raises safety concerns. Before you panic, know that most issues have simple solutions. These problems can range from unresponsive buttons to persistent display lights. Understanding how to troubleshoot these common issues helps you resolve them quickly. You can ensure your appliance functions correctly. This section covers steps to take if your oven seems stuck "on" or behaves unusually when you try to power it down.

#### Unresponsive Buttons

If the START/CANCEL button does not respond when you press it, first check if the oven is locked. Some models have a child lock feature. Refer to your user manual to see if this is active. Try unplugging the oven for 30 seconds. Then plug it back in. This often resets the internal electronics. It can fix minor glitches. Ensure the button itself is not physically stuck or damaged. If the problem persists after a reset, you might need to contact Breville customer support. They can offer more specific troubleshooting or repair options.

#### Persistent Display Lights

You pressed the START/CANCEL button, but the display lights remain on. This might indicate the oven is in a standby mode, not fully off. Some models show a dim clock or a small indicator light even when "off." If it is more than just a dim light, and the fan is still running, try pressing and holding the START/CANCEL button for a longer duration (5-10 seconds). This often initiates a deeper shutdown. If lights still persist and the oven feels warm, unplug the unit from the wall outlet. Wait until it cools completely. Plug it back in and try turning it off again. This ensures a full power cycle.

#### Dealing with Power Surges

Power surges can affect any electronic appliance. They can cause unexpected behavior, including problems with turning off. If your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro acts strangely after a power flicker or outage, unplug it immediately. Leave it unplugged for several minutes. This allows any residual electrical charge to dissipate. Then, plug it back in. This "hard reset" can often clear minor electrical glitches caused by surges. Using a surge protector for your appliance is also a good idea. A surge protector can prevent future damage from electrical fluctuations.

### Maintaining Your Breville Smart Oven After Use

Turning off your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro is only one part of post-cooking care. Proper maintenance after each use helps extend your appliance's life. It keeps it working efficiently. This includes letting it cool down properly. It also involves regular cleaning. Neglecting these steps can lead to decreased performance. It can also cause premature wear. A well-maintained oven is a safe and effective cooking tool. I always make sure to give my oven the care it needs. This ensures it performs well for every meal.

#### Allowing Proper Cooling

After turning off your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro, it remains hot. Internal components retain significant heat. Allow the oven to cool down completely before you clean it or move it. Opening the door slightly can help dissipate heat faster. Never attempt to clean a hot oven. This risks burns. It also causes cleaning solutions to vaporize. This can be dangerous. The cooling process can take some time. Be patient. Once the oven is cool to the touch, it is safe for the next steps.

#### Routine Cleaning Tips

Regular cleaning is crucial for your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro. It keeps the oven hygienic and extends its life. Once the oven has cooled, wipe down the interior and exterior with a damp cloth. Use a mild dish soap if needed. Avoid abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals. They can damage surfaces. For tougher stains, refer to your oven's manual. You can find more specific cleaning instructions. Some parts like the wire rack may be removable for easier washing. Cleaning after each use prevents grease and food buildup. This makes bigger cleaning jobs less frequent.

Think about where you place your oven. Consider how often you clean it. These small actions make a big difference. They ensure your oven serves you well for many years. It is worth investing a little time in these habits. This saves you money in the long run.

#### Optimal Placement and Ventilation

The placement of your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro matters. Ensure it sits on a stable, heat-resistant surface. Give it enough space around all sides. Proper ventilation is critical. Do not place it directly against a wall or under cabinets. Good airflow prevents heat buildup. This protects the oven's internal components. It also protects your countertops and nearby surfaces. Adequate space helps the oven cool down efficiently after use. This contributes to its long-term health.

#### Regular Maintenance Schedule

Establish a routine maintenance schedule for your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro. This goes beyond just wiping it down after each meal. Periodically check the crumb tray. Empty it and clean it regularly. Inspect the heating elements for food debris. Clean them carefully when cool. Ensure the power cord is free from kinks or damage. A regular check-up helps catch small issues before they become big problems. This proactive approach saves you from costly repairs. It keeps your oven running like new.
