## Stop the Shake: What To Do If Your Washing Machine Is Shaking

A washing machine that shakes can be quite alarming. You might hear loud thumping noises, or even see your appliance moving across the laundry room floor. This common problem causes stress and potential damage. It also reduces the lifespan of your valuable appliance. Understanding what to do if your washing machine is shaking helps prevent bigger issues. I will guide you through simple troubleshooting steps and more complex repairs. This article covers everything from basic fixes to when professional help is needed, ensuring your laundry days are quiet and calm again.

### Takeaway

If your washing machine is shaking, take these key steps:

*   **Check the Load:** Redistribute clothes for balance, especially heavy items.
*   **Verify Leveling:** Adjust the feet to ensure the machine stands flat and stable.
*   **Inspect Components:** Look for worn shock absorbers, suspension springs, or worn drum bearings.
*   **Review Installation:** Confirm the transit bolts are removed.
*   **Consider Floor Stability:** Ensure your floor can support the machine's weight and movement.

A shaking washing machine often signals an unbalanced load or an unlevel surface. First, pause the cycle and redistribute the clothes evenly inside the drum. Next, check the washing machine's feet. Adjust them until all four corners are firm on the floor, preventing any rocking motion.

## Understanding Why Your Washing Machine Is Shaking Violently

When your washing machine is shaking violently, it is important to understand the root causes. This problem is more than just an annoyance. It often indicates an underlying issue. Many factors can contribute to excessive vibration during a wash cycle.

One common reason is an unbalanced load. This happens when heavy items or a small number of clothes clump together on one side of the drum. During the spin cycle, the machine tries to balance this weight. The uneven distribution causes the drum to spin off-center. This then creates a strong shaking motion. You can learn more about proper loading to avoid this issue by reading about [how full a washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be).

Another major cause is an unlevel washing machine. If your appliance does not sit flat on the floor, it will rock and shake, especially during high-speed spins. The leveling feet might need adjustment. Sometimes, the floor itself is uneven or weak. A solid, level surface is crucial for stable operation.

Worn-out components also cause shaking. Over time, parts like shock absorbers or suspension springs can degrade. These parts are designed to absorb vibrations. When they fail, the machine's movements are no longer controlled. This leads to noticeable shaking and noise. Identifying these worn parts helps in targeted repair.

### Common Factors Leading to Excessive Vibration

Several common factors frequently cause washing machines to shake. I have seen these problems time and time again. Addressing them often resolves the issue quickly. Understanding these factors helps you diagnose the problem yourself.

*   **Unbalanced Load:** This is arguably the most frequent culprit. Clothes become unevenly distributed. This imbalance causes the drum to wobble significantly during the spin cycle. Think about washing a single heavy blanket. It can easily get stuck on one side.
*   **Uneven Surface or Unlevel Feet:** Your washing machine needs to sit perfectly flat. If the floor is uneven, or the leveling feet are not properly adjusted, the machine will rock. This movement intensifies during the spin cycle. Ensure your appliance has a stable base.
*   **Transit Bolts:** New washing machines come with transit bolts. These bolts secure the drum during transport. If you do not remove them before the first use, the machine will shake violently. They restrict drum movement, which is critical during operation. Always check if these are removed.
*   **Worn or Damaged Components:** Internal parts wear down. Shock absorbers, suspension springs, and drum bearings are designed to manage movement. If these components are worn, they cannot absorb vibrations effectively. This results in excessive shaking.

Proper diagnosis starts with checking these common issues. By systematically ruling out each one, you can pinpoint the exact problem. This approach saves time and avoids unnecessary repairs.

## Immediate Steps to Take When Your Washer Shakes

When your washing machine starts shaking, it can be startling. My first thought is always safety. Before doing anything else, you must prioritize your safety and prevent further damage. Taking immediate action can protect both you and your appliance. These steps are simple but crucial.

Always start by pausing or stopping the wash cycle. If the machine is still spinning, hit the 'Pause' or 'Stop' button immediately. If it's shaking violently, unplug the machine from the wall outlet. This cuts power to the unit. It prevents any electrical hazards or further uncontrolled movement.

Once the machine is off and unplugged, open the lid or door. Carefully inspect the laundry load. Often, the shaking is due to clothes getting bunched up on one side. Redistribute the items evenly around the drum. If it's a very small load, add a few towels to help balance the weight. If it's a very large, heavy item, consider washing it separately. I sometimes find that one large blanket can cause significant issues, especially in specific models like a [Whirlpool washing machine shaking violently](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-whirlpool-washing-machine-shaking-violently).

After redistributing the load, close the door and restart the cycle. Choose a gentler spin speed if available. Observe the machine carefully. If the shaking continues, you know the unbalanced load was not the only issue. You need to investigate further. These immediate steps often resolve the problem. If not, they provide a safe starting point for deeper troubleshooting.

### Safety First: Power Down and Unplug

My top priority when a washing machine shakes violently is always safety. This means immediately cutting power to the appliance. Ignoring this step can lead to serious risks. An uncontrolled, shaking machine can easily damage itself or its surroundings.

First, locate the main power button on your washing machine. Press it to turn off the unit. Next, and this is crucial, unplug the washing machine from the wall outlet. This ensures no electricity flows to the machine. It protects you from electrical shock. It also prevents the machine from unexpectedly restarting.

Do not attempt any inspection or adjustment while the machine is powered on. Moving parts can cause injury. An unplugged machine is a safe machine to work on. This simple action prepares the unit for safe troubleshooting. It also prevents any further damage to your home or the appliance itself.

### Redistributing the Laundry Load

Once the machine is safely powered down, the next step is to examine the laundry load. An unbalanced load is a very common cause of washing machine shaking. I always check this first. It's often the easiest fix.

Open the washing machine door or lid. Observe how the clothes are distributed inside the drum. You might see a large lump of wet laundry on one side. This happens frequently with heavy items like towels, blankets, or jeans. They absorb a lot of water. This makes them significantly heavier.

Carefully move the clothes around. Spread them evenly across the entire drum. If the load is very small, adding a few extra towels can help. These extra items provide additional weight. This helps to balance the drum during the spin cycle. If the load is excessively large, remove some items. This reduces the overall weight. Overloading can also contribute to imbalance. After redistributing, close the door and restart the cycle. Often, this simple adjustment stops the shaking.

## The Unbalanced Load Problem: A Common Cause of Washing Machine Vibration

An unbalanced load is the most frequent reason your washing machine starts vibrating or shaking. It's a simple issue with a straightforward solution. Understanding how this happens helps prevent it in the future. I often see people fill their washers without much thought to distribution.

During the wash and rinse cycles, clothes tumble freely. However, when the spin cycle begins, the machine speeds up dramatically. If items are clumped together on one side of the drum, that side becomes much heavier. This weight imbalance causes the drum to wobble as it tries to spin. The machine literally fights against itself. This creates significant vibration and noise.

This problem is especially common with certain types of laundry. Heavy, absorbent items like blankets, towels, or large jackets are prime culprits. They soak up a lot of water, becoming quite heavy. When they stick to one side of the drum, they throw off the machine's balance. Washing only one or two large items can also lead to imbalance. The machine has no other items to help distribute the weight.

### How to Properly Load Your Washing Machine

Loading your washing machine correctly can prevent most shaking issues. It is about more than just fitting everything inside. Proper loading promotes even distribution of weight. I follow a few simple rules when doing laundry.

First, mix different sized items. Do not wash only heavy towels or only light t-shirts. Combine heavier items with lighter ones. This helps fill the drum more uniformly. The different weights and sizes distribute better. This prevents large clumps from forming.

Second, avoid overloading the machine. An overloaded drum cannot tumble clothes freely. This makes it impossible for the machine to balance the load. Leave some space at the top of the drum. For most machines, the drum should be about three-quarters full. Remember, clothes expand when wet. If you are unsure about proper loading, you can always check out resources on [how full your washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be).

Third, distribute clothes loosely. Do not stuff them tightly into the drum. This prevents them from forming a single heavy mass. For front-loaders, place items one by one. For top-loaders, arrange them in a circle around the agitator. These simple habits significantly reduce the chances of an unbalanced load. They ensure a smoother and quieter wash cycle.

### Tips for Preventing Unbalanced Loads

Preventing unbalanced loads saves you from frustrating shaking. It also extends the life of your washing machine. I always keep these tips in mind for every laundry day. They make a real difference.

*   **Mix Fabric Types:** Combine heavy items with lighter ones. A load of only towels or only sheets often gets unbalanced. Mixing creates a more even weight distribution. This helps the drum spin smoothly.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Do not cram too many clothes into the drum. Leave enough space for items to tumble freely. Overloading prevents proper water circulation. It also makes it impossible for the machine to balance the load.
*   **Use Appropriate Load Sizes:** If you wash one large, heavy item, add a couple of smaller items or towels. This helps distribute the weight. Likewise, extremely small loads can also cause imbalance. They might not be enough to fill the drum evenly.
*   **Distribute Evenly:** For top-loaders, place items around the agitator, not just on one side. For front-loaders, drop clothes in loosely. Avoid pushing everything to the back. This simple act of spreading items out prevents clumping.
*   **Check Before Spin:** If your machine has a "soak" or "pre-wash" cycle, sometimes clothes can clump before the main spin. Open the lid/door briefly before the spin cycle to check and redistribute if needed. This proactive step helps a lot.

Following these tips helps you prevent washing machine shaking. It leads to quieter operation. It also ensures your clothes get a better wash.

## Leveling Your Washing Machine: Fixing an Uneven Foundation

An unlevel washing machine is a frequent cause of excessive shaking and noise. Your washing machine must sit perfectly flat on the floor. If it rocks even slightly, this movement will amplify during the high-speed spin cycle. Fixing an uneven foundation is usually a simple task. It requires minimal tools and a bit of patience.

Most washing machines come with adjustable leveling feet. These feet are located at the bottom corners of the appliance. They allow you to raise or lower each corner independently. This compensates for uneven flooring. If your washing machine is rocking, it means one or more of these feet are not making firm contact with the floor. This creates instability.

I once had a machine that shook so much it walked across the room. The issue was purely the leveling. Adjusting the feet made all the difference. It stopped the machine from moving. Proper leveling also reduces wear and tear on the internal components. When a machine is constantly rocking, it puts extra stress on the suspension system. This can lead to premature failure of parts like shock absorbers or springs.

### How to Check and Adjust Washing Machine Leveling Feet

Checking and adjusting your washing machine's leveling feet is a crucial step to stop shaking. This process is straightforward. You only need a few basic tools. I always start with a level tool.

First, gather your tools. You will need a spirit level. A wrench or pliers might be necessary for some leveling feet. Sometimes, you can adjust them by hand. Before you begin, pull the washing machine away from the wall. This gives you enough room to work.

Place the spirit level on top of the washing machine. Check it from front to back and then side to side. The bubble should be perfectly centered in both directions. If it is not, your machine is unlevel. Identify which corners are too high or too low.

Now, adjust the leveling feet. Most feet thread in and out.
*   To raise a corner, turn the foot counter-clockwise.
*   To lower a corner, turn the foot clockwise.

Work on one foot at a time. Make small adjustments. Keep rechecking with the spirit level after each adjustment. Some feet have a lock nut. If so, loosen the lock nut before adjusting. Tighten it securely once the foot is in place. This prevents the foot from moving during operation. Continue until the machine is perfectly level. All four feet should make firm contact with the floor. Try pushing down on each corner. There should be no rocking motion. This ensures stability.

### The Role of Anti-Vibration Pads and Floor Stability

Even a perfectly leveled washing machine can sometimes vibrate. This is especially true on certain types of flooring. This is where anti-vibration pads and floor stability become important. They work together to minimize movement.

Anti-vibration pads are simple, inexpensive accessories. They are usually made of rubber. You place them under each of the washing machine's feet. These pads create a shock-absorbing layer. They dampen vibrations. This prevents the machine from "walking" across the floor. They also reduce noise. I have used them on hard tile floors. They made a noticeable difference. You can find out more about how to minimize movement in your machine with tips on [how to make a washing machine not move](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-washing-machine-not-move).

Floor stability plays an equally important role. A flimsy or weak floor can flex and bounce during the spin cycle. This amplifies vibrations. If your laundry room is on an upper floor, or on a wooden floor, this might be a factor.
*   **Reinforce the Floor:** If possible, reinforce the floor underneath the machine. This might involve adding extra supports.
*   **Solid Foundation:** Always ensure the machine is on a solid, level surface. Concrete floors are ideal.
*   **Avoid Risers:** Do not place the washing machine on tall, unstable risers. These can worsen shaking.

Combining proper leveling with anti-vibration pads and ensuring a stable floor provides the best results. These measures work to create a quiet and stable laundry experience.

## Dealing with Worn-Out Components: Shocks, Springs, and Bearings

Sometimes, a shaking washing machine points to internal component failure. This is not always a simple fix like balancing a load. Over time, the parts designed to manage movement and absorb vibrations can wear out. These components include shock absorbers, suspension springs, and drum bearings. Their failure directly leads to excessive shaking, especially during the spin cycle.

Shock absorbers, often found in front-loading machines, dampen the motion of the wash tub. They are similar to the shock absorbers in a car. If they become weak or broken, they cannot control the tub's movement. This allows the tub to bounce violently. You might hear loud thumping noises.

Suspension springs, more common in top-loading washers, hold the wash tub in place. They allow it to move freely but within limits. If these springs stretch or break, the tub can sag or tilt. This creates an imbalance that results in shaking. I have seen springs snap, causing immediate, severe shaking.

Drum bearings allow the inner drum to spin smoothly. If these bearings wear out, the drum will wobble and grind. This causes significant shaking and a very distinct loud noise. Often, it sounds like a jet engine during the spin cycle. This issue often requires more involved repair.

### Identifying and Replacing Worn Shock Absorbers

Worn shock absorbers are a common cause of shaking in front-load washing machines. Identifying their failure involves a bit of observation. Replacing them can be a DIY task for some, but it requires caution.

To identify if your shock absorbers are worn, first unplug the machine. Open the door and push down firmly on the top of the drum. Release it quickly. The drum should bounce once or twice and then settle. If it continues to bounce excessively, or if it sways from side to side, your shock absorbers are likely weak. You might also notice dark greasy streaks on the floor underneath the machine, which can be oil leaking from the shocks.

Replacing shock absorbers typically involves:
1.  **Accessing the Shocks:** This usually means removing the front or back panel of the washing machine. Consult your appliance's service manual for specific instructions. Different models, such as [Bosch washing machines](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-stop-bosch-washing-machine-from-shaking), might have unique access points.
2.  **Removing Old Shocks:** Each shock absorber is usually held in place by pins or bolts at both ends. Remove these fasteners.
3.  **Installing New Shocks:** Insert the new shock absorbers. Ensure they are oriented correctly. Secure them with the pins or bolts. Make sure all fasteners are tight.
4.  **Testing:** Once installed, reassemble the machine. Run a test cycle with a small load. Observe for improved stability.

This task requires some mechanical aptitude. If you are unsure, calling a professional is a safer option. Safety is key when working with internal parts.

### Inspecting and Replacing Suspension Springs and Drum Bearings

Suspension springs and drum bearings are critical for stable washing machine operation. Their failure causes significant shaking. Inspecting and replacing these parts can be more involved. I always approach these repairs with careful attention.

**Suspension Springs (mainly top-loaders):**
*   **Inspection:** Unplug the machine. Remove the cabinet. The springs are typically found at the top corners of the wash tub, hooked to the frame. Look for springs that are stretched, rusted, or broken. A sagging tub on one side also indicates a failed spring.
*   **Replacement:** Carefully unhook the old spring using pliers. Replace it with a new one. Ensure it hooks securely into both the tub and the frame. Replace all springs if one is bad. This helps maintain even tension.

**Drum Bearings (both front and top-loaders, more common in front-loaders):**
*   **Inspection:** This is a more complex diagnosis. With the machine unplugged, try to move the inner drum by hand. If it wobbles excessively or makes a grinding noise when you spin it, the bearings are likely faulty. A loud "jet engine" sound during spin also points to bad bearings.
*   **Replacement:** Replacing drum bearings is a major repair. It often involves disassembling the outer tub. This can be time-consuming. It may require specialized tools. The parts are pressed into the tub. This is often a job for an experienced DIYer or a professional. Misalignment can cause further damage.

For complex repairs like drum bearings, considering a professional service might be best. It ensures the job is done right. It prevents further damage to your appliance.

## Troubleshooting Specific Washing Machine Types: Front-Loaders vs. Top-Loaders

While many causes of washing machine shaking are universal, front-load and top-load machines have distinct designs. These differences mean certain problems are more prevalent in one type over the other. Understanding these specificities helps in troubleshooting. I find that recognizing these differences saves time in diagnosis.

Front-loading washing machines typically spin at much higher speeds than top-loaders. This higher RPM means any imbalance or component issue can lead to more dramatic shaking. They often rely on strong shock absorbers and a robust suspension system. If these parts wear, the shaking becomes very pronounced. Their horizontal drum design also makes them prone to unbalanced loads if clothes are not distributed well.

Top-loading washing machines, especially older models with agitators, generally have a simpler suspension system, often relying on springs. While they spin slower, an unbalanced load can still cause significant issues. Agitator models might have problems with clothes wrapping around the agitator, creating an uneven weight distribution. High-efficiency (HE) top-loaders without an agitator are more like front-loaders in their load distribution requirements. They use a wash plate at the bottom.

Regardless of type, proper installation is paramount. Ensure transit bolts are removed from new machines. Always check the leveling feet. These basic steps apply to both designs. Knowing the common issues for your specific machine type helps you narrow down the problem quickly.

### Front-Load Washer Specific Shaking Issues

Front-load washing machines are known for their efficiency and gentle wash. However, their design makes them susceptible to specific shaking issues. I have seen these problems often with front-loaders.

One common problem is **worn shock absorbers**. Front-loaders use these to dampen the vibrations of the horizontally mounted drum. When they weaken, the drum begins to bang against the frame. This causes severe shaking during the spin cycle. The machine might also become much louder.

Another issue can be **damaged or loose counterweights**. Front-load washers have heavy concrete blocks attached to the drum. These help stabilize the machine. If a counterweight becomes loose or breaks, the machine will vibrate intensely. You might hear a clunking noise when the drum starts or stops. This indicates a problem with the counterweights.

**Drum bearings** are also a frequent culprit in front-loaders. As they wear out, the drum will wobble and make a loud grinding or roaring sound. This typically escalates during the spin cycle. Replacing these bearings is a major repair. It often requires significant disassembly of the machine.

Lastly, **door gasket issues** can indirectly cause problems. A damaged gasket might allow water to leak. This could affect internal components or the floor beneath the machine, leading to instability over time. Ensure your front-loader door gasket is clean and intact. Addressing these front-loader specific points helps solve shaking problems effectively.

### Top-Load Washer Specific Shaking Issues

Top-load washing machines, while different in design, also have their unique reasons for shaking. These often relate to their vertical drum and agitator (or impeller) system. I notice specific patterns when troubleshooting top-loaders.

A primary cause for top-load washer shaking is **worn suspension rods or springs**. Older top-loaders often use a set of four rods with springs. These support the wash tub. If one or more rods or springs lose their tension or break, the tub will become unbalanced. This makes it sag or shift to one side. This directly leads to intense shaking during the spin cycle. The tub might also hit the sides of the cabinet.

Another common issue is **unbalanced loads caused by clothes wrapping around the agitator**. In top-loaders with a central agitator, small items or delicate fabrics can get tangled. This creates a heavy, uneven mass on one side. This causes the machine to vibrate. High-efficiency (HE) top-loaders without agitators are also prone to unbalanced loads. Their wash plate at the bottom can still cause clothes to clump.

**Motor coupling or transmission problems** can also cause issues. While less common, if the motor coupling starts to fail, it can cause erratic movements or loud noises that mimic shaking. Similarly, a failing transmission can lead to unusual vibrations. These are more serious mechanical issues. They typically require professional diagnosis and repair. Understanding these specific points helps target the fix for your top-load washer.

## Advanced Diagnostics: When to Call a Professional for Washing Machine Shaking

Sometimes, troubleshooting your shaking washing machine goes beyond simple fixes. If you have checked the load, leveled the machine, and inspected for basic wear, but the shaking persists, it might be time for advanced diagnostics. These issues often involve internal mechanical failures. They require specialized knowledge and tools. Knowing when to call a professional saves you time and prevents potential further damage to your appliance.

My rule of thumb is this: if the problem is not an unbalanced load or an unlevel machine, and you are not comfortable disassembling the appliance, call a technician. Attempting complex repairs without proper experience can worsen the problem. You might also void your warranty. Professionals have the right tools and diagnostic equipment. They can accurately identify issues like worn motor couplings, transmission problems, or damaged drum spiders.

Persistent loud grinding, roaring, or heavy thumping noises, even with an empty drum, are strong indicators of a more serious internal issue. Bearings are a common culprit for grinding noises. Loud thumping can point to failing shock absorbers or suspension. If your machine is leaking water in addition to shaking, this is another red flag. Water leaks can indicate a damaged tub or seal, which complicates the repair. Do not ignore these signs. They signal a need for expert intervention.

### Signs That Professional Help Is Needed

Recognizing when to call a professional for your shaking washing machine is important. Some signs clearly indicate that the problem is beyond a simple DIY fix. I advise seeking expert help when you encounter these situations.

*   **Persistent Loud Noises:** If your washing machine makes a constant loud grinding, roaring, or jet-engine-like noise during the spin cycle, even with an empty drum, the drum bearings are likely failing. This is a complex repair.
*   **Excessive Bouncing or Swaying:** After checking the leveling and load, if the inner tub still bounces or sways uncontrollably, especially in front-loaders, the shock absorbers or suspension springs are probably worn out. This requires internal access and part replacement.
*   **Machine "Walking" Consistently:** If the machine consistently moves across the floor, even after ensuring it is level and stable, this points to a fundamental suspension problem. Anti-vibration pads might help, but they won't fix a deeper mechanical issue.
*   **Visible Damage or Leaks:** Any visible damage to the internal drum, or water leaking from the machine during operation, indicates serious mechanical failure. Leaks can compound the problem by damaging other components.
*   **Error Codes:** Modern washing machines often display error codes for specific malfunctions. If your machine shows a suspension or motor-related error code, consult the manual. If the solution involves complex parts replacement, call a professional.
*   **Unsuccessful DIY Attempts:** If you have tried all the basic troubleshooting steps—checking the load, leveling, inspecting for transit bolts—and the shaking continues, a deeper issue is probably present. It is time to call a technician.

These signs indicate that the problem requires more than a simple adjustment. A professional can diagnose the exact issue. They can also perform the necessary repairs safely.

### Cost Considerations for Professional Washing Machine Repair

When deciding whether to call a professional for a shaking washing machine, cost is a significant factor. I always weigh the repair cost against the price of a new appliance. Understanding potential repair expenses helps in this decision.

Repair costs vary widely based on the specific issue.
*   **Minor fixes**, like adjusting leveling feet or redistributing a load, cost nothing if you do it yourself.
*   **Replacing components** like shock absorbers or suspension springs can range from $150 to $300, including parts and labor. These parts themselves might cost $30-$100.
*   **Major repairs**, such as replacing drum bearings or a transmission, are much more expensive. These can easily cost $300-$600 or more. The parts are often costly. The labor is extensive due to the required disassembly.

I recommend getting a diagnostic fee quote upfront. Most technicians charge a fee to diagnose the problem. This fee often gets applied to the final repair cost if you proceed with their service. Compare this cost to the price of a new washing machine. Entry-level washing machines can start around $500-$700. High-end models go much higher.

Consider the age of your appliance. If your washing machine is very old (over 10-12 years) and the repair cost is more than 50% of a new machine's price, replacement might be more economical. Newer machines often come with better energy efficiency. This can lead to long-term savings. For insights on potential replacement costs, you might look at articles like [how much an LG washing machine costs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-is-lg-washing-machine) or [how much a Samsung washing machine costs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-samsung-washing-machine). Make an informed decision by weighing all these factors.

## Preventing Future Washing Machine Shaking Issues

Preventing your washing machine from shaking in the first place is always better than fixing it. Regular maintenance and proper usage habits significantly reduce the likelihood of this problem. I have found that a proactive approach saves both time and money. It also prolongs the life of your appliance.

The most effective prevention starts with proper loading. Always distribute your laundry evenly inside the drum. Mix heavy and light items. Avoid overloading the machine. These simple steps prevent unbalanced loads, which are the leading cause of shaking. Make it a habit to arrange clothes loosely before starting a cycle.

Regularly check your washing machine's level. Over time, the leveling feet can shift. Floors can also settle. Use a spirit level every few months. Adjust the feet as needed to ensure the machine remains stable. This small check prevents minor wobbles from escalating into violent shakes. Consider using anti-vibration
