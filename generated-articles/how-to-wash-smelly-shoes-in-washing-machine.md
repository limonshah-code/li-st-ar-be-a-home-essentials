## Wash Smelly Shoes: Your Ultimate Machine Washing Guide

Smelly shoes are a common problem. Nobody enjoys the unpleasant odor that escapes from a pair of worn sneakers or athletic shoes. You might wonder if your washing machine can handle this task. The good news is, yes, it often can.

Using your washing machine offers a convenient way to bring freshness back to your footwear. This method cleans deep inside the shoe fibers, tackling the source of the smell directly. This comprehensive guide will show you how to safely and effectively wash smelly shoes in your washing machine. We will cover everything from checking shoe materials to drying them properly. My goal is to help you achieve fresh, clean shoes, ready for your next adventure.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Material:** Confirm your shoes are machine-washable.
*   **Prepare Shoes:** Remove laces, insoles, and pre-clean loose dirt.
*   **Protect Machine:** Place shoes in a mesh bag with old towels.
*   **Choose Settings:** Select a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent.
*   **Air Dry:** Always air dry shoes completely away from direct heat.

To wash smelly shoes in a washing machine, first remove laces and insoles. Place shoes in a mesh laundry bag with towels for cushioning. Use a gentle or delicate cycle with cold water and mild detergent. Air dry thoroughly away from direct heat to prevent damage and new odors.

## Is Your Smelly Pair Machine-Washable? Check Shoe Material

Before you start, check if your smelly shoes can go into the washing machine. Not all shoes are machine-friendly. Washing the wrong material can cause damage or shrinking. You want your shoes to come out clean, not ruined.

Most athletic shoes, sneakers, and canvas shoes are generally safe for machine washing. These often have durable synthetic uppers and rubber soles. Think about your running shoes or casual canvas sneakers. They usually hold up well. However, leather, suede, silk, or certain delicate embellished shoes should never go into a washing machine. Water and agitation can ruin these materials. Always check the care tag if your shoes have one. If there is no tag, consider the material carefully. When in doubt, hand wash instead. Your shoes will thank you for this precaution. My rule is: if it feels too fancy or delicate, keep it out of the machine.

Some specialized shoes also require specific care. For example, some outdoor shoes like certain Merrell models might have unique washing instructions. Always prioritize the manufacturer’s recommendations. Ignoring them can void warranties or cause irreparable damage to the shoe's structure. You are protecting your investment by doing this quick check. This step is crucial for success.

## Essential Prep Steps for Washing Smelly Shoes

Proper preparation makes a big difference when you wash smelly shoes. Skipping these steps can lead to less effective cleaning or even damage. I always take a few moments to get my shoes ready. This ensures the best results and protects both my shoes and my washing machine.

First, remove the laces from your shoes. Laces can get tangled during the wash cycle. They can also prevent the water and detergent from reaching all parts of the shoe. I like to wash laces separately by hand or place them in a small mesh bag. This keeps them from wrapping around other items or getting lost. Next, pull out the insoles. Insoles are often the main source of odor. They absorb a lot of sweat and bacteria. Washing them separately allows for a more thorough cleaning. You can scrub them by hand with soap and water or put them in the mesh bag with the shoes. For very stubborn odors, consider soaking the insoles in a solution of warm water and baking soda first.

After removing laces and insoles, remove any loose dirt or debris from the shoes. I use an old brush or a paper towel to wipe off mud, dirt, or gravel. You do not want these bits clogging your washing machine drain. For particularly smelly shoes, a quick pre-soak can help. You can soak them in a bucket of warm water with a cup of white vinegar for 30 minutes. This helps loosen grime and neutralize some of the strong odors before the main wash. For more general shoe cleaning tips, you can read our guide on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).

Finally, place your shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag provides a layer of protection. It stops the shoes from banging against the washing machine drum. This is important because hard knocks can damage both your shoes and your machine. Add a few old towels to the washing machine drum along with the bagged shoes. The towels act as a buffer. They absorb some of the impact, preventing loud thudding noises. They also help balance the load, which is good for the washing machine’s mechanics. Make sure the towels are old ones that you do not mind getting dirty.

## Choosing the Right Detergent and Odor Fighters

Selecting the correct cleaning agents is vital for tackling shoe odor. You want to eliminate the smell, not just mask it. I find that a combination of standard laundry products and natural deodorizers works best. You do not need harsh chemicals to get great results.

Start with a mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid powdered detergents, as they can sometimes leave residue in the shoe material. A small amount of liquid detergent is usually enough. Too much detergent can be hard to rinse out, potentially leaving a sticky film inside your shoes. This film can even attract more dirt later. I usually use about half the amount I would for a regular load of clothes. This is because shoes are a smaller, more concentrated load.

To actively fight odors, I often add a natural booster. White vinegar is excellent for neutralizing smells. Add about half a cup of white distilled vinegar to the detergent dispenser or directly into the wash cycle. Vinegar breaks down the bacteria that cause the stink. It does not leave a vinegar smell once the shoes are dry. Baking soda is another powerful odor absorber. You can sprinkle a tablespoon or two directly into each shoe before washing, or add it to the wash cycle. Both vinegar and baking soda are safe for most shoe materials and washing machines. They are also eco-friendly alternatives to chemical deodorizers.

Some commercial odor eliminators are designed for laundry. If you prefer a stronger boost, look for laundry additives specifically marketed for sports gear or odor removal. Follow the product instructions for these. Always check that they are safe for colored items, especially if your shoes are brightly colored. I prefer natural solutions first because they are gentle. They also prevent any irritation from chemical residues. Using the right products ensures your shoes come out smelling truly fresh. This thoughtful approach helps your shoes last longer and smell better.

## Setting Your Washing Machine for Smelly Shoes

Setting your washing machine correctly is a critical step. The wrong settings can damage your shoes or your machine. I always make sure to choose a gentle cycle. This protects the shoe's structure and materials.

Select the "Delicate" or "Gentle" cycle on your washing machine. Some machines have a specific "Hand Wash" or "Bulky Items" cycle that might also work. These cycles use less agitation. Less agitation means less stress on your shoes. It prevents them from being tossed around too aggressively. Rough cycles can deform shoes or pull seams apart. You want a slow, gentle wash, not a violent tumble. If your machine allows, choose a slow spin speed as well. High spin speeds can also be too harsh.

Always use cold water. Hot water can cause certain materials, especially glues and synthetic fabrics, to shrink or warp. It can also cause colors to bleed. Cold water cleans just as effectively for shoes, especially with the help of baking soda or vinegar. Cold water is also more energy-efficient. This is a small way to save on utility bills. If your machine has a "rinse only" option after the main wash, I sometimes use it. This ensures all detergent and odor fighters are thoroughly rinsed out.

Different washing machine brands may have unique features. For example, if you have an LG washing machine, you might find specific instructions for washing larger items. You can learn more about washing shoes in an LG machine by checking out our guide on [can you wash shoes in LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-lg-washing-machine). Similarly, Bosch washing machines have their own cycles and recommendations. Regardless of the brand, the principle remains the same: gentle cycle, cold water, and low spin. This protects your shoes and ensures a successful wash. Proper settings make sure your smelly shoes come out clean and intact.

## Post-Wash Care: Drying Smelly Shoes Correctly

Drying your shoes properly is just as important as washing them. Incorrect drying can lead to new odors, mold, or damage. You want your shoes to be completely dry to prevent future smell. I always prioritize air drying.

Never put shoes in a clothes dryer. The high heat from a dryer can melt glues, shrink materials, or warp the shape of your shoes. This damage is often irreversible. Even low heat settings are risky for most shoe types. The tumbling action can also damage the dryer drum or the shoes themselves. Patience is key when drying shoes. This step takes the longest, but it is worth it.

After the wash cycle finishes, take your shoes out of the mesh bag. Give them a gentle shake to remove excess water. My favorite trick for faster drying is to stuff them with old newspaper or paper towels. The paper absorbs moisture from the inside. Change the paper every few hours, or as it becomes damp. This technique speeds up the drying process significantly. It also helps the shoes keep their shape. Make sure to use plain, black-and-white newspaper to avoid ink transfer to light-colored shoes.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. A sunny spot outside or near an open window is ideal. Air circulation is crucial for effective drying and preventing mildew. Avoid direct sunlight for extended periods if your shoes are brightly colored, as it can cause fading. A fan can also speed up the process. Position the shoes so air can flow inside them. Drying time varies depending on the shoe material and humidity levels. It can take anywhere from 12 hours to 2 full days. Make sure they are bone dry before wearing them again or putting them away. Any residual dampness will invite new odor-causing bacteria.

If you have cleaned your shoes but they still have a slight damp smell, it usually means they are not fully dry. Place them in a new well-ventilated spot. Add fresh paper stuffing. This patience ensures your clean shoes stay fresh.

## Beyond the Wash: Preventing Future Shoe Odor

Washing your smelly shoes is a great start. However, preventing future odors is even better. A few simple habits can keep your shoes smelling fresh for longer. I make these practices part of my routine. This saves me from constant washing. For more comprehensive advice on maintaining fresh shoes, you can always refer to our guide on [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean).

First, focus on foot hygiene. Clean feet are the first defense against smelly shoes. Wash your feet daily with soap and water, ensuring you dry them thoroughly. Fungi thrive in damp environments. Consider using anti-fungal foot powders or sprays if you are prone to sweaty feet. Wearing clean socks every day is also non-negotiable. Socks absorb sweat. Changing them frequently prevents moisture from transferring to your shoes. Choose socks made from moisture-wicking materials, like wool or synthetic blends, over cotton. These materials pull sweat away from your skin.

Second, practice shoe rotation. Do not wear the same pair of shoes every single day. Give your shoes at least 24 hours to air out and dry completely between wears. This allows moisture to evaporate naturally. Having a few pairs of active shoes to rotate extends their lifespan and keeps them fresher. I usually have at least two pairs of running shoes I alternate. When not wearing them, store your shoes in a well-ventilated area. Avoid stuffing them into a dark, damp closet immediately after wearing them.

Third, use shoe deodorizers regularly. Cedar shoe trees are excellent. They absorb moisture and impart a pleasant, natural scent. You can also use commercially available shoe deodorizer balls or pouches. These often contain activated charcoal or other odor-absorbing materials. Sprinkling a little baking soda inside your shoes overnight can also help. Just remember to shake it out before wearing them. These simple steps keep your shoes smelling good. They reduce the need for frequent deep washes.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues After Washing Shoes

Sometimes, even after following all the steps, you might encounter a few issues. Do not worry. Most problems have straightforward solutions. I have faced these myself, and I can tell you how to handle them.

One common issue is a lingering smell. If your shoes still smell after washing and drying, they might not have been completely clean or dry. First, check if they are truly bone dry inside. Any dampness can cause a new musty odor. If they feel damp, air them out longer in a well-ventilated area. If they are dry but still smell, the odor might be deeply embedded. You might need to re-wash them. This time, try increasing the amount of white vinegar or baking soda you add to the wash cycle. You could also try pre-soaking them for a longer period before the wash.

Another concern is if your washing machine develops a smell after washing shoes. Shoes can introduce dirt and bacteria into the machine. This can lead to a musty odor inside the drum. It is important to clean your washing machine regularly, especially after washing heavily soiled items like shoes. I run a cleaning cycle after washing shoes. You can use a special washing machine cleaner or run an empty hot water cycle with two cups of white vinegar. This helps flush out any residue and kill bacteria.

Finally, sometimes shoes can get damaged during the wash. This usually happens if the wrong cycle was used or if the shoes were not properly protected. If seams have come undone or parts have detached, check if they can be re-glued with a strong shoe adhesive. For future washes, ensure you use a mesh bag and plenty of old towels for cushioning. Double-check the shoe material suitability before washing. Learning from these issues helps you refine your process. You will soon master the art of washing shoes in your machine.
