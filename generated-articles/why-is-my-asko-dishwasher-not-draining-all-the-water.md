### Takeaway

*   **Check Filters:** Food particles often clog the main filter. Clean it regularly.
*   **Inspect Drain Hose:** Look for kinks or blockages in the drain hose.
*   **Examine Drain Pump:** A faulty pump or debris in the impeller stops draining.

### Clear Answer to Main Query

An Asko dishwasher that is not draining all the water typically has a clog. This clog is often in the filter, drain hose, or air gap. A faulty drain pump or issues with the garbage disposal connection also stop draining.

## Understanding Asko Dishwasher Drainage Systems

Asko dishwashers are known for their quality. They use a specific system to remove water. First, water goes through a filter at the bottom. This filter catches food debris. Next, a drain pump pushes water out of the dishwasher. The water travels through a drain hose. This hose usually connects to your sink's drain or a garbage disposal. Finally, water flows into your home's main drain system.

Each part of this system must work correctly. If any part fails, water collects inside the dishwasher. Small food bits can build up over time. Hoses can bend or get blocked. The pump might stop working due to age or damage. Knowing how the system works helps you find the problem. This knowledge guides you in fixing the issue effectively.

## Troubleshooting Clogged Filters and Sumps

One of the most common reasons an Asko dishwasher is not draining is a clogged filter. The filter sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Its job is to catch food particles. This prevents them from entering the drain pump. Over time, these particles build up. They can form a dense layer that blocks water flow. If water cannot pass through the filter, it cannot reach the drain pump.

To fix this, you must clean the filter. Asko dishwashers have easy-to-remove filters. First, turn off the dishwasher. Then, take out the bottom rack. You will see the filter assembly. It usually twists out or lifts up. Remove any large pieces of food or debris. Rinse the filter under running water. Use a brush to scrub away stubborn residue. Also, check the sump area below the filter. This area can collect grime. Clean it thoroughly. A clean filter ensures smooth water drainage. Regular filter cleaning prevents many drainage problems.

## Inspecting the Dishwasher Drain Hose

The drain hose carries water from your Asko dishwasher to your home's drain. If your Asko dishwasher is not draining all the water, this hose might be the culprit. The drain hose can get kinked or crushed. This often happens if the dishwasher moves. It also occurs if something heavy presses on the hose. A kink stops water flow. The hose can also become clogged with grease or food debris. Over time, these materials build up inside the hose.

First, check the entire length of the drain hose. Look behind the dishwasher. Look under the sink. Make sure the hose is not bent sharply. Straighten any kinks you find. If the hose looks clear from the outside, the clog might be inside. You may need to disconnect the hose from both ends. Have a bucket ready to catch any water. Use a long brush or snake to clear any blockages. Blow through the hose to check for obstructions. A clear drain hose is essential for proper drainage.

## Examining the Dishwasher Drain Pump

The drain pump is a vital part of your Asko dishwasher's drainage system. It pulls water from the tub. It then pushes the water through the drain hose. If your Asko dishwasher is not draining all the water, the drain pump might be faulty. A pump can fail in several ways. The motor might burn out. The impeller, which is a small fan that moves water, might break. Debris can also get stuck in the impeller. This prevents it from spinning freely.

You can often hear a drain pump working. If you hear no sound when the dishwasher should be draining, the pump might be dead. If you hear a humming sound but no water movement, the impeller might be blocked. Accessing the drain pump involves removing panels. You might need to tilt or pull out the dishwasher. Before working on the pump, always unplug the dishwasher. Check the impeller for foreign objects like broken glass or food debris. Clear any blockages. If the pump still does not work after clearing debris, it likely needs replacement. This is often a job for a qualified technician.

## Troubleshooting the Air Gap and Garbage Disposal Connection

Many Asko dishwashers use an air gap. This small cylinder is often on your kitchen counter near the faucet. It prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into your dishwasher. If your Asko dishwasher is not draining all the water, a clogged air gap is a common cause. Food particles or grease can build up inside it. This blocks the air gap. Water then cannot exit the dishwasher properly.

To check the air gap, remove its cover. This is usually a metal cap. Then, remove the plastic cap underneath. Look for any debris inside. Clear it out using a small brush or toothpick. You can also disconnect the hoses from the air gap. Blow through them to ensure they are clear. If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, check that connection too. A common error occurs if a new garbage disposal is installed. The knockout plug inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet must be removed. If this plug is not removed, water cannot flow into the disposal. Run the disposal to clear any food trapped inside. A clear air gap and proper garbage disposal connection are crucial for drainage. Also, general drain issues in the sink can sometimes affect the dishwasher if they share a drain line.

## Dealing with Electrical Issues and Control Board Problems

Sometimes, the reason your Asko dishwasher is not draining all the water is not mechanical. It can be an electrical problem. The drain pump needs power to work. If the pump is not getting power, it will not drain water. This could be due to a tripped circuit breaker. Check your home's breaker box. Reset the breaker if it is off. It might also be a loose wire connection inside the dishwasher. Wires can shake loose over time.

A more complex electrical issue involves the control board. The control board is the "brain" of your dishwasher. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump. If the control board is faulty, it might not send the correct signal. This means the pump never turns on. Asko dishwashers have diagnostic modes. You can check your owner's manual for steps to enter this mode. This might show error codes related to drainage. Replacing a control board is complex. It often requires a professional technician. Ensure you unplug the dishwasher before checking any electrical components. Safety is always important when dealing with appliances.

## Advanced Troubleshooting and Professional Help

You have checked the filter, drain hose, air gap, and pump for debris. You have also looked at electrical connections. If your Asko dishwasher is still not draining all the water, you might have a more complex issue. A broken check valve can be a problem. The check valve prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher after it drains. If it is stuck closed, it will block water from leaving. If it is stuck open, water can flow back in. This valve is usually near the drain pump.

Another issue could be the drain pump itself, needing replacement. Sometimes, the problem is not a clog but a worn-out pump motor. You can test the pump with a multimeter to check for continuity. However, this requires electrical knowledge. If you have tried all the common fixes, it is time for professional help. Appliance repair technicians have specialized tools and training. They can quickly diagnose complex problems. They can also replace parts safely and correctly. Do not hesitate to call a technician if you feel unsure. Repairing an Asko dishwasher can be specific. They understand the nuances of Asko models.

## Preventing Future Dishwasher Drainage Problems

Preventing issues is always better than fixing them. If you want to stop your Asko dishwasher from not draining all the water in the future, follow some simple steps. First, always scrape large food scraps off plates before loading the dishwasher. This reduces the amount of debris entering the filter. Pre-rinsing is not necessary for most modern dishwashers, but removing large chunks helps. Remember that even a small buildup can cause issues.

Regular cleaning of your dishwasher is key. Clean the filter at least once a month. This prevents food particles from accumulating. A general [guide on how to clean a water filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-water-filter) can provide useful techniques applicable to your dishwasher's filter. Periodically run an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner. This helps clear grease and mineral deposits from the hoses and internal components. You can use a specific dishwasher cleaner or a cup of white vinegar. Also, check the drain hose periodically for kinks or obstructions. Proper maintenance extends your Asko dishwasher's life. It keeps it running efficiently.
