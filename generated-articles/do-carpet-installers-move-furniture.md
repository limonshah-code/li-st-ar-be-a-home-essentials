**Do carpet installers move furniture?**

Carpet installers may move furniture, but this service varies greatly by company and the specific agreement. Some installers include light furniture relocation as part of their standard service. However, heavy, oversized, or complex items often require separate arrangements, extra fees, or your direct involvement. Always clarify this detail with your installer beforehand to avoid surprises.

## The Standard Practice: Do Carpet Installers Move Furniture?

When you consider new carpet, a key concern is furniture. You wonder if the installation team handles this part of the job. The common question is, "Do carpet installers move furniture?" The answer is not always a simple yes or no. It depends on several factors.

Many carpet installation companies offer some level of furniture moving. This can range from moving light pieces to offering a full-service option for an extra charge. Installers understand that most homeowners need help with larger items. They often include basic services to meet this need. You should not assume anything. Always ask specific questions about their policy.

The specific terms of furniture moving are part of your contract. Different companies have different rules. Some companies include moving basic items like sofas and chairs. They might not charge you extra for these. Other companies consider all furniture moving an additional service. This means you will pay more for it.

The size and type of furniture also affect the service. Installers are generally equipped to move common household items. They have tools and experience for standard beds, tables, and dressers. However, they draw lines for certain items. Very heavy or delicate pieces fall outside their standard scope.

It is best to discuss furniture moving early in the process. When you get quotes for your carpet, bring this up. Ask each company about their specific furniture moving policy. This helps you compare services accurately. It also allows you to plan your budget and preparation tasks. This proactive approach ensures a smooth installation day.
