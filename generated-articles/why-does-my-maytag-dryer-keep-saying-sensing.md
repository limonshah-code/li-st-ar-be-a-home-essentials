*   **Clean the dryer's moisture sensors** regularly.
*   **Avoid overloading** the dryer drum.
*   **Select the correct dryer cycle** for your clothes.

Your Maytag dryer keeps saying "Sensing" primarily due to issues affecting its ability to detect moisture and airflow. Common causes include a clogged lint filter, obstructed dryer vents, dirty moisture sensors, or an overloaded dryer drum. Addressing these simple maintenance tasks often resolves the problem quickly.

## Understanding Your Maytag Dryer's Sensing Function

When your Maytag dryer displays "Sensing," it is doing its job. This message indicates the dryer is actively detecting moisture levels in your clothes. Modern Maytag dryers use advanced technology. This technology ensures your garments dry efficiently and prevents over-drying. It is a smart system designed to save energy and protect your clothes.

The dryer checks for moisture throughout the cycle. It adjusts the drying time based on what it finds. This keeps clothes from shrinking and saves you money on energy bills. If this "Sensing" phase lasts too long, it signals a problem. We need to find out what is stopping this process.

### The Role of Moisture Sensors

Maytag dryers have moisture sensors. These are small metal bars inside the dryer drum. Clothes tumble against these bars as the dryer runs. The sensors measure the electrical conductivity between them. Wet clothes conduct electricity better than dry ones.

The dryer's control board uses this information. It decides how much more drying time is needed. If these sensors are dirty or faulty, they cannot read moisture correctly. This makes your Maytag dryer keep saying "Sensing." It cannot determine the next step.

### How Sensing Impacts Drying Cycles

The sensing function directly controls the drying cycle. When you select an automatic cycle, the dryer runs in "Sensing" mode first. It continues this mode until it detects a certain level of dryness. Then, it transitions to a cool-down phase or shuts off.

If the "Sensing" phase never finishes, the dryer will not progress. This means your clothes stay damp. It also means the dryer runs longer, wasting energy. Understanding this function helps you troubleshoot the issue. It guides you to the right solution for your dryer.

## Common Culprits: Why Your Maytag Dryer Stays on Sensing

It is frustrating when your Maytag dryer keeps saying "Sensing." Many factors can contribute to this problem. Often, the issue is not a major breakdown. Instead, it is a simple maintenance need. Let us look at the most frequent reasons this happens.

Knowing these common culprits helps you quickly identify the problem. You can then take steps to fix it. We will cover the usual suspects in detail. This way, you can get your dryer back to proper working order.

### Lint Filter Overload

A clogged lint filter is a top reason for dryer issues. Lint builds up quickly with every load. This fine fiber blocks airflow through your dryer. When airflow is restricted, moisture sensors cannot accurately detect humidity.

The dryer struggles to sense when clothes are dry. It just keeps trying, showing "Sensing" on the display. Always clean your lint filter before each use. A clean filter ensures proper airflow and efficient drying. This small step can prevent many problems.

### Restricted Dryer Venting

Beyond the lint filter, the dryer vent system also needs clear airflow. The vent hose and exterior vent hood can become clogged. Lint, debris, or even small animal nests block the exhaust. Poor venting traps moisture inside the dryer.

The dryer's sensors detect high humidity, but the clothes are not drying properly. The dryer cannot move past the "Sensing" stage. It keeps trying to dry the clothes. A blocked vent is a fire hazard too. It is crucial to ensure clear venting. If your Maytag dryer keeps saying "Sensing", this is a common reason. You can find more information about this issue here: [Why Does My Maytag Dryer Keep Saying Check Vent](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-maytag-dryer-keep-saying-check-vent).

### Overloaded Dryer Drum

We all try to save time by doing larger loads. But an overloaded dryer drum creates problems. When too many clothes pack the drum, air cannot circulate freely. The moisture sensors cannot make proper contact with clothes.

This leads to uneven drying. Some clothes might be dry, others still damp. The dryer cannot get a consistent moisture reading. It stays in "Sensing" mode, unable to finish the cycle. Break up large loads into smaller ones. This helps the dryer work best.

## The Critical Role of a Clean Lint Filter and Vent System

Maintaining a clean lint filter and vent system is vital. These components are your dryer's lungs. They allow hot, moist air to escape. When they are blocked, your dryer struggles. This struggle often results in your Maytag dryer saying "Sensing" indefinitely.

Keeping these parts clear prevents overheating. It also makes your dryer more efficient. Neglecting them leads to longer drying times. It can even become a fire hazard. We will show you how to keep these crucial parts clean.

### Cleaning the Lint Screen Properly

Your dryer's lint screen traps lint from clothes. It is usually found in the door opening or on the top panel. You should clean this screen before every single load. Simply pull it out and remove the lint by hand.

Do not just wipe it with your hand. You should also wash it with soap and water occasionally. Lint can build up a waxy film over time. This film is not always visible. Washing the screen helps remove this invisible buildup. A clean lint screen ensures maximum airflow. This allows the dryer to sense moisture correctly. For detailed steps, refer to [How to Clean Maytag Dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-maytag-dryer).

### Inspecting and Clearing the Dryer Vent Hose

The dryer vent hose connects your dryer to the outside. It is usually a flexible foil or rigid metal duct. Over time, lint accumulates inside this hose. You should inspect this hose regularly, perhaps every few months. Disconnect the hose from the dryer and the wall.

Look inside for lint buildup. Use a vacuum cleaner attachment or a long brush to clear it. Make sure the hose is not kinked or crushed. A damaged or restricted hose significantly impacts airflow. This makes your Maytag dryer struggle. It may then keep saying "Sensing" due to poor moisture removal.

### Professional Vent Cleaning Benefits

While you can do basic cleaning, professional vent cleaning offers deeper benefits. Professionals use specialized tools. They reach far into the vent system, even behind walls. They remove stubborn clogs and buildup. This ensures your entire vent system is free of obstructions.

A professional cleaning is a good idea every 1-2 years. It improves dryer efficiency and safety. It also helps prevent your Maytag dryer from getting stuck on "Sensing." A clear vent system means better performance. It also means faster drying times. When your dryer takes too long to dry, a clogged vent could be the reason.

## Addressing Moisture Sensor Issues on Your Maytag Dryer

The moisture sensors are key to your dryer's "Sensing" function. They tell the dryer how wet your clothes are. If these sensors are dirty, they cannot read moisture levels accurately. This makes the dryer think clothes are still wet, even when they are not. Your Maytag dryer will then keep saying "Sensing."

Cleaning these sensors is a simple task. It often resolves the problem quickly. However, sometimes the sensors themselves might be faulty. Knowing how to check and clean them is important. It can save you from unnecessary service calls.

### Locating and Cleaning the Moisture Bars

Most Maytag dryers have two or three metal strips. These are the moisture sensors. They are usually found inside the dryer drum. You will see them on the front bulkhead, just below the drum opening. They look like shiny metal bars.

Over time, fabric softener residue or mineral deposits build up on them. This creates an insulating layer. It stops the sensors from detecting moisture. Use a soft cloth and rubbing alcohol or a mild household cleaner. Gently wipe the sensor bars clean. Avoid harsh abrasives that could scratch the metal. A quick wipe can restore their function.

### When to Replace Dryer Moisture Sensors

After cleaning the sensors, if your Maytag dryer still keeps saying "Sensing," they might be faulty. There are a few signs that indicate a sensor needs replacing. Your dryer might consistently under-dry or over-dry clothes. It might also show inconsistent drying times.

You can test sensor continuity with a multimeter if you are comfortable with basic electrical tests. However, for most homeowners, the best indicator is persistent issues after cleaning. Replacing faulty moisture sensors is a repair many DIY enthusiasts can handle. You can buy replacement parts online or from an appliance parts store.

## Proper Loading and Cycle Selection for Optimal Drying

Loading your dryer correctly seems simple. Yet, it plays a big role in how well your dryer functions. An improper load can cause your Maytag dryer to keep saying "Sensing." This happens because the dryer cannot get accurate readings. It struggles to distribute heat and airflow.

Choosing the right dryer cycle is also essential. Different fabrics need different care. Using the wrong setting can confuse the dryer's sensors. Let us explore how smart loading and cycle choices improve drying. These practices help your dryer work efficiently.

### Avoid Overloading the Dryer Drum

Stuffing too many clothes into the dryer is a common mistake. This practice reduces efficiency. It also prevents proper airflow and tumbling. When clothes are packed tightly, they cannot tumble freely. This means only the outer layer might dry.

The moisture sensors cannot get good contact with all items. This causes the dryer to keep "Sensing" as it tries to find a dry state. Always leave enough space for clothes to tumble freely. A good rule is to fill the drum about halfway. This allows air to circulate. It also allows clothes to make proper contact with the sensors.

### Sorting Laundry for Efficient Drying

Sorting your laundry before drying helps a lot. Heavy items, like jeans and towels, dry slower than light items, like shirts. Mixing them in one load is not ideal. The dryer's sensors will detect moisture from the heavier items. This makes the lighter items over-dry.

Separate heavy and light fabrics. Dry similar types of fabrics together. This ensures a more even drying process. It helps your Maytag dryer finish its "Sensing" phase more quickly. It makes the dryer operate more efficiently too.

### Choosing the Right Dryer Cycle

Maytag dryers offer various drying cycles. Each cycle is designed for specific fabric types. Using the correct cycle is important. For example, delicate cycles use lower heat. Heavy-duty cycles use higher heat. The automatic cycles rely on the moisture sensors.

If you use a timed dry cycle, the dryer runs for a set time. It does not use the moisture sensors. If your Maytag dryer keeps saying "Sensing," ensure you selected an automatic cycle. Choose the cycle that matches your laundry type. This helps the dryer accurately sense dryness and complete the cycle.

## Electrical and Power Supply Considerations for Your Dryer

Your Maytag dryer needs a proper electrical supply. Modern dryers use a 240-volt connection. This provides enough power for heating and tumbling. If the dryer does not get enough power, it can malfunction. This can lead to your Maytag dryer saying "Sensing" indefinitely.

Power issues can be subtle. They might not always cause the dryer to shut off completely. Sometimes, they just prevent it from operating correctly. It is important to check your dryer's power source. This ensures it receives the necessary voltage.

### Checking Your Dryer's Power Connection

First, ensure your dryer is fully plugged into the wall outlet. A loose plug can cause intermittent power issues. Push it firmly into the socket. Also, check the power cord for any visible damage. Frayed wires or burns indicate a problem.

Never use a damaged power cord. It is a safety hazard. If the outlet itself seems loose or shows signs of scorching, stop using it. Have a qualified electrician inspect the outlet. Proper power is essential for all dryer functions, including sensing.

### Understanding Circuit Breaker Trips

Dryers draw a lot of power. They are usually on a dedicated circuit breaker. If the breaker trips, your dryer will not work. Sometimes, a weak breaker might trip intermittently. Or, it might supply reduced power. This can affect the dryer's heating elements.

A dryer that does not heat properly will struggle to dry clothes. The Maytag dryer keeps saying "Sensing" because it cannot reduce moisture. Check your home's electrical panel. Find the breaker labeled for your dryer. Ensure it is fully in the "On" position. If it frequently trips, a professional electrician should investigate.
