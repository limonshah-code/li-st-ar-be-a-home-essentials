# What Size Is An Apartment Size Dishwasher

## Understanding Apartment Dishwasher Sizes: Your Compact Kitchen Guide

Have you ever looked at your small kitchen and dreamed of having a dishwasher? Many people live in apartments or homes with limited space. A full-size dishwasher often seems impossible in these situations. Luckily, manufacturers create appliances specifically for smaller areas.

These smaller units are called "apartment size dishwashers." They offer the convenience of clean dishes without taking up too much room. We will explore the exact dimensions of these compact machines. We will discuss different types and installation options. This guide helps you understand everything about fitting a dishwasher into your small living space.

### Takeaway

*   Apartment size dishwashers are typically 18 inches wide.
*   They come in built-in, portable, and countertop models.
*   Consider your kitchen space, capacity needs, and installation options.
*   Compact dishwashers save space, water, and energy.

### What size is an apartment size dishwasher?

An apartment size dishwasher generally measures 18 inches wide. This is smaller than a standard 24-inch dishwasher. These compact models fit into tighter kitchen layouts. They provide efficient dish cleaning for smaller households or limited spaces.

## Defining the Apartment Size Dishwasher

An apartment size dishwasher is a compact appliance designed for smaller living spaces. Its key characteristic is its reduced width. This allows it to fit where a traditional dishwasher cannot. These dishwashers bring great convenience to people living in apartments, tiny homes, or condos. They also suit small kitchens in larger houses.

We often think of "apartment size" as a specific dimension. It signals a product made to optimize space. These dishwashers still offer powerful cleaning performance. They simply do it on a smaller scale. My experience shows that these units change daily routines for many people. They free up time spent handwashing dishes.

These smaller units do not compromise on essential features. You can still find various wash cycles and energy-saving options. They are a smart choice for anyone facing space limitations. Understanding their typical dimensions helps you plan your kitchen layout.

## Standard Apartment Dishwasher Dimensions

When people talk about an apartment size dishwasher, they usually refer to an 18-inch model. This width is the most common compact option available. A standard dishwasher is 24 inches wide. This 6-inch difference makes a large impact in a small kitchen. Knowing these dimensions is the first step in finding the right unit for your home.

### Width: The Defining Factor

The typical width for an apartment size dishwasher is 18 inches. Some models might be slightly under or over this measurement. However, 18 inches is the industry standard for built-in compact units. This dimension dictates whether the dishwasher will slide into an existing cabinet opening. It also helps in planning a new kitchen design.

### Height and Depth Considerations

While width is the main difference, height and depth are also important. Most 18-inch dishwashers share similar height and depth measurements with their full-size counterparts. A typical height is 34 to 35 inches. The depth is usually around 24 inches. These measurements ensure the dishwasher fits seamlessly under standard kitchen countertops. Remember to account for the necessary space for plumbing and electrical connections behind the unit. This helps ensure a smooth installation. Always measure your space accurately before buying a dishwasher.

## Types of Compact Dishwashers for Small Spaces

Compact dishwashers come in different forms. Each type suits specific needs and kitchen layouts. Understanding these options helps you choose the best fit for your home. My personal preference often leans toward the built-in look, but I appreciate the flexibility of other types. They all help you avoid hand-washing dishes.

### Built-in 18-inch Dishwashers

Built-in 18-inch dishwashers are the most popular "apartment size" choice. These units install permanently into your kitchen cabinetry. They offer a sleek, integrated look. They require dedicated plumbing and electrical connections. Many people prefer them because they clear countertop space. This type gives your kitchen a clean, finished appearance.

These dishwashers blend in with your existing cabinets. They are often found in newer apartments or renovated kitchens. They provide a seamless look. Before you purchase, verify your cabinet opening measurements. This step is critical for a smooth installation process.

### Portable Dishwashers

Portable dishwashers offer flexibility. They roll out when you need them and store away when you do not. These units connect to your kitchen faucet for water supply. They drain into the sink. Portable models are great for renters or anyone who cannot make permanent modifications. They typically come in 18-inch or even 24-inch widths, but the 18-inch is more common for apartments.

I find portable dishwashers extremely convenient for temporary living situations. You do not need any special installation. Just roll it, connect it, and wash your dishes. This type gives you the option of moving it if you rearrange your kitchen. They also come in various styles and finishes.

### Countertop Dishwashers

Countertop dishwashers are the smallest option. They sit directly on your kitchen counter. These miniature dishwashers are perfect for very small spaces or single users. They typically hold 4 to 6 place settings. Like portable models, they connect to your faucet for water. They also drain into the sink.

While they take up valuable counter space, they offer ultimate convenience. They remove the chore of handwashing for small loads. I have seen these save a lot of time for college students or individuals. They are easy to install and move. This makes them ideal for temporary use or specific small-scale needs.

## Benefits of a Small Dishwasher for Compact Living

Choosing an apartment size dishwasher offers many advantages beyond just fitting into a small space. These compact appliances deliver big benefits for people in tight living situations. They simplify daily life in meaningful ways. I often tell friends about how much time they can save.

### Space Efficiency

The most obvious benefit is space saving. An 18-inch dishwasher uses significantly less cabinet space than a 24-inch model. This extra room can be used for more storage. In a small kitchen, every inch counts. This means you can have clean dishes without sacrificing precious counter or cabinet room.

Think about the feeling of a clutter-free kitchen. A compact dishwasher helps achieve this. It makes your cooking area feel more organized and functional. This benefit alone makes these dishwashers a top choice for apartment dwellers.

### Water and Energy Savings

Smaller dishwashers typically use less water and energy per cycle. They wash fewer dishes at a time. This results in lower utility bills. Modern compact models are often very energy-efficient. They meet strict Energy Star standards. This helps the environment and your wallet.

My own experience shows that running a smaller load more frequently can be more efficient than waiting for a large dishwasher to fill. You will always have clean dishes. This also reduces your overall household resource consumption.

### Convenience and Time Saving

Having a dishwasher, regardless of its size, provides immense convenience. No one enjoys hand-washing dishes after a meal. An apartment size dishwasher handles this chore for you. This frees up your time for other activities.

Imagine coming home after a long day and simply loading dishes into a machine. This small luxury significantly improves daily living. It removes a common household burden. This is the convenience that an apartment size dishwasher brings to your home.

## Factors to Consider Before Buying an Apartment Dishwasher

Buying an apartment size dishwasher involves more than just measuring the space. You need to think about several factors to ensure you pick the best model for your home. Making an informed decision helps avoid future frustrations. I always advise considering your specific needs carefully.

### Kitchen Space and Layout

Carefully measure the space where the dishwasher will go. This includes width, height, and depth. Also, consider the surrounding area. Do cabinet doors open freely? Will the dishwasher door clear obstacles when open? Think about how the dishwasher fits into your kitchen's overall flow. We have another article that covers [are all dishwashers the same size](https://homeessentialsguide.com/are-all-dishwasher-the-same-size) for more insights on dimensions.

For portable or countertop models, assess where you will store them. Also, think about how they connect to the sink. These details impact daily use. Proper measurement is crucial for any appliance installation.

### Capacity Needs

Apartment size dishwashers hold fewer dishes than standard models. An 18-inch built-in unit typically holds 8-10 place settings. A countertop model holds 4-6. Consider your household size and how often you cook. A single person or a couple might find a compact dishwasher sufficient. A small family might need to run it more often.

Think about your typical dish load. Do you use many large pots and pans? Check the interior configuration. Some compact models offer adjustable racks or clever loading options. This maximizes their capacity.

### Installation Requirements

The type of dishwasher you choose determines its installation. Built-in models require permanent plumbing and electrical connections. You might need professional installation. Portable and countertop models connect to your faucet. They plug into a standard outlet. These require no permanent changes.

Consider whether you own or rent your home. Renters often prefer portable or countertop options. Homeowners might opt for the integrated look of a built-in unit. Understanding these requirements helps budget for installation costs or plan for DIY setup.

### Features and Energy Efficiency

Modern dishwashers offer various features. Look for options like multiple wash cycles, delay start, or a sanitizing rinse. Noise level is also important, especially in open-concept apartments. Check for the dishwasher's decibel (dB) rating. Lower numbers mean quieter operation.

Energy efficiency is another key factor. Look for the Energy Star label. This ensures the appliance meets specific efficiency standards. An energy-efficient model saves money on utility bills over time. These small details can greatly improve your user experience.

## Installation Options and Considerations

Installing an apartment size dishwasher depends on its type and your kitchen setup. Each option has its own requirements. Understanding these helps you prepare for the installation process. I always recommend thorough planning to avoid surprises.

### Built-in Dishwasher Installation

Installing a built-in 18-inch dishwasher requires more steps. You need a dedicated space in your cabinetry. This space must have access to water lines, a drain line, and an electrical outlet. Often, a professional plumber or electrician helps with this. This ensures proper and safe connections.

The dishwasher slides into the cabinet opening. It then connects to the hot water supply under your sink. The drain line usually connects to the sink's drain or a garbage disposal. The electrical connection powers the unit. Make sure your existing connections are suitable. If you want to know more about different dishwasher dimensions, take a look at our article on [what is a normal size dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-a-normal-size-dishwasher).

### Portable Dishwasher Setup

Portable dishwashers are simpler to set up. They do not require permanent plumbing changes. These units come with a hose that attaches to your kitchen faucet. They also have a drain hose that goes into your sink. An electrical cord plugs into a standard outlet.

You can roll the portable dishwasher to your sink when needed. After use, you disconnect it and store it away. This makes them ideal for temporary use or for renters. My experience with portable units taught me the value of this flexibility. Always ensure the faucet connection is secure before running a cycle.

### Countertop Dishwasher Connection

Countertop dishwashers offer the easiest installation. They simply sit on your counter. Similar to portable models, they connect to your faucet. Their drain hose goes into your sink. They plug into a standard electrical outlet.

These small units are very user-friendly. They require minimal effort to get started. Just make sure you have enough counter space near your sink. They are perfect for small loads and quick cleaning.

### Addressing Plumbing and Electrical Needs

Regardless of the dishwasher type, proper plumbing and electrical connections are vital.
For built-in units, check if your kitchen has existing connections. If not, you might need to hire professionals to install them.
For portable and countertop models, ensure your faucet is compatible with the adapter. Also, check that you have easily accessible outlets. Safety is always a priority with appliance installations.

## Maintenance and Longevity of Compact Dishwashers

Proper maintenance extends the life of any appliance, including your apartment size dishwasher. Regular care keeps it running efficiently. It also prevents costly repairs. I always advise a few simple steps to keep your machine in top condition.

### Regular Cleaning Practices

Clean your dishwasher regularly. Food particles and mineral deposits can build up. This affects performance.
Use a dishwasher cleaner specifically designed for this purpose. Run an empty hot water cycle with the cleaner.
Wipe down the interior, including the door gasket, with a damp cloth. This prevents mold and mildew growth.

Check the filter periodically. Many dishwashers have a removable filter at the bottom. Clean it to remove trapped food debris. A clean filter ensures good drainage and better cleaning results. This simple step makes a big difference.

### Descaling for Hard Water

If you live in an area with hard water, mineral buildup can be an issue. Limescale can reduce efficiency and leave spots on dishes.
Use a descaling agent designed for dishwashers. You can also run an empty cycle with white vinegar. Place a cup of white vinegar on the bottom rack. Then run a hot water cycle.
Do this every few months to keep your dishwasher free of mineral deposits. This helps maintain optimal performance.

### Loading and Usage Tips

Load your dishwasher correctly. Do not overload it. Overloading prevents water from reaching all dishes. This leads to poor cleaning.
Scrape large food particles off dishes before loading. You do not need to pre-rinse, but remove solid waste. This keeps the filter cleaner.
Use the correct amount of detergent. Too much can cause sudsing issues. Too little will not clean effectively.
These small habits contribute to a long-lasting and efficient dishwasher. They make your dishwashing experience better.

## Comparing Apartment Dishwashers to Standard Models

Understanding the differences between apartment size and standard dishwashers helps you choose the right one. Both types clean dishes, but they cater to different needs and spaces. My aim is to highlight these key distinctions clearly.

### Size and Footprint

The most obvious difference is size. A standard dishwasher is typically 24 inches wide. An apartment size dishwasher is 18 inches wide. This 6-inch difference is significant in small kitchens. The smaller footprint of an apartment dishwasher allows it to fit into tighter spaces.

Think about a small kitchen with limited cabinet space. An 18-inch unit might be the only option. A 24-inch model is common in larger homes or open-concept kitchens. The choice often comes down to available physical space. For more information on standard dimensions, check our article on [what is standard size of dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-standard-size-of-dishwasher).

### Capacity and Loading

Standard dishwashers generally hold 12-14 place settings. Apartment size dishwashers typically hold 8-10 place settings. This difference affects how often you need to run the machine. A larger household might find a compact model too small. They might need to run it multiple times a day.

For individuals or couples, an 18-inch dishwasher provides enough capacity. You might need to be more strategic about loading. Consider your daily dish volume when making your decision. My experience tells me that most small households find the capacity perfectly adequate.

### Features and Performance

Both apartment size and standard dishwashers offer similar features. You can find multiple wash cycles, delay start, and energy-saving options in both. The core cleaning performance is generally comparable. Manufacturers use advanced technology in both sizes.

Some high-end standard models might offer more specialized features. However, compact dishwashers still provide excellent cleaning. They often include similar wash arms and drying systems. The primary trade-off is capacity, not necessarily performance or available features.

### Price Range

The price of dishwashers varies by brand, features, and size. Generally, 18-inch compact dishwashers can be slightly less expensive than their 24-inch counterparts. However, specialty compact models with advanced features can also carry a premium price.

Installation costs might also differ. Built-in units often require professional installation, which adds to the overall cost. Portable and countertop models usually have lower initial and installation costs. Evaluate your budget and needs to find the best value.

## Finding the Right Apartment Dishwasher for Your Home

Choosing the right apartment size dishwasher for your home requires careful thought. You want a machine that fits your space and meets your needs. I find that a step-by-step approach simplifies this process.

### Measure Your Available Space Accurately

The first step is always to measure. Use a tape measure to get precise dimensions for the width, height, and depth of your intended space. Remember to account for any pipes or electrical outlets behind the unit. This prevents installation issues later on.

If you consider a portable or countertop model, measure your counter space. Ensure it can accommodate the unit without hindering other kitchen activities. These precise measurements are crucial for a successful purchase.

### Assess Your Dishwashing Needs

Think about how many dishes you typically wash. Are you a single person, a couple, or a small family? Do you cook elaborate meals or mostly simple ones? This helps determine the required capacity.

Consider how often you are willing to run the dishwasher. A smaller capacity means more frequent cycles. Match the dishwasher's capacity to your household's daily dish load. This ensures satisfaction with your choice.

### Decide on the Dishwasher Type

Based on your space and installation capabilities, choose between a built-in, portable, or countertop model.
*   **Built-in:** For a permanent, integrated look and if you can make plumbing modifications.
*   **Portable:** For renters or those needing flexibility without permanent installation.
*   **Countertop:** For very small spaces or minimal dishwashing needs.

Each type offers distinct advantages. Selecting the correct type simplifies the entire process.

### Compare Features and Brands

Research different brands and their specific models. Look for features important to you. Examples include quiet operation, specific wash cycles, or drying options. Read reviews from other users.

Compare energy efficiency ratings. This impacts long-term running costs. Find a balance between features you want and your budget. This research helps you make a confident decision.
