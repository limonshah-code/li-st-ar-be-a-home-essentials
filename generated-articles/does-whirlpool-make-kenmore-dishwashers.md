*   **Other companies like LG, Electrolux (Frigidaire), and GE Appliances (Haier) also make Kenmore dishwashers.** The manufacturer changes based on the model and time period.
*   **You can identify the true manufacturer by checking the model number.** Look for a prefix or specific codes on the appliance.

### The Direct Answer: Who Makes Kenmore Dishwashers?

Whirlpool has historically been a significant manufacturer of Kenmore dishwashers. However, Kenmore itself is a brand name owned by Sears. It does not operate its own factories. Various appliance companies, including Whirlpool, LG, and Electrolux, produce Kenmore-branded dishwashers at different times and for various models. So, while some Kenmore dishwashers are made by Whirlpool, not all of them are.

## Understanding the Kenmore Brand Model

Kenmore is a name many trust in home appliances. Yet, Kenmore does not make its own products. Sears, a major retailer, created the Kenmore brand. They launched it as their house brand many years ago. This means Kenmore appliances are "white-label" products.

Different manufacturers build appliances for Kenmore. These manufacturers put the Kenmore label on their products. They build them to Sears' specifications and design. This practice lets Sears offer a wide range of appliances. They do this without owning the factories themselves. It also allows consumers to get products from various manufacturers under one brand.

This model has been successful for decades. It gives consumers choices. It also creates a sense of reliability through the Kenmore name. But it means the underlying quality can vary. It depends on which company made your specific unit. This system is common in many industries. It requires a bit of detective work for consumers.

## Whirlpool's Significant Role in Kenmore Dishwasher Production

Whirlpool has long been a major partner for the Kenmore brand. For many years, Whirlpool manufactured a large share of Kenmore dishwashers. This partnership was strong and well-known. You could often find Whirlpool-made Kenmore models in stores. They offered reliable performance and features.

Whirlpool is a global leader in appliance manufacturing. Their expertise helped build a strong reputation for Kenmore dishwashers. Many Kenmore models shared designs and parts with actual Whirlpool models. This made finding parts or understanding features easier for consumers. My own experience with older Kenmore units often pointed to Whirlpool origins. These units often felt robust and well-built.

This connection extended beyond dishwashers. Whirlpool also manufactured other Kenmore appliances. For example, many Kenmore refrigerators have come from Whirlpool. You can learn more about this connection here: [Is Kenmore Refrigerator Made by Whirlpool](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-kenmore-refrigerator-made-by-whirlpool). Understanding this partnership is key. It helps clarify the quality and design behind many Kenmore products. It also shows the importance of researching specific models.

### Identifying Whirlpool-Made Kenmore Dishwashers

You can often tell if Whirlpool made your Kenmore dishwasher. Look at the model number. Kenmore model numbers often begin with a prefix. This prefix usually identifies the manufacturer. For example, a model number starting with "665" often indicates a Whirlpool-manufactured unit.

You can find the model number on a sticker. This sticker is usually on the inner edge of the dishwasher door. Sometimes it is on the side of the tub. Checking this number helps you identify the original maker. Knowing the true manufacturer gives you insight into the appliance. It tells you about its features and potential lifespan.

## Other Key Manufacturers of Kenmore Dishwashers

While Whirlpool played a big part, they were not the only company making Kenmore dishwashers. Other major appliance manufacturers also contributed. This is part of the white-label model. Companies like LG, Electrolux (which also makes Frigidaire), and GE Appliances (now owned by Haier) have all produced Kenmore units. This means your Kenmore dishwasher could come from various origins.

The manufacturer often changes over time. Sears would sign new contracts with different companies. These contracts might be for specific models or entire product lines. This approach allowed Kenmore to offer diverse features and price points. Each manufacturer brings its own technology and design philosophy. For instance, an LG-made Kenmore might feature different washing mechanisms. It could have different drying systems than a Whirlpool-made one.

This diversity is a strength and a challenge. It gives consumers many options. However, it also means that the "Kenmore" name does not guarantee a consistent underlying product. When you wonder [what company makes Kenmore dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-company-makes-kenmore-dishwashers), remember it's often a rotating cast of industry giants. This makes researching your specific model vital.

### A Look at Other Manufacturers

*   **LG:** Known for advanced technology and quiet operation. LG-made Kenmore dishwashers often boast innovative features.
*   **Electrolux (Frigidaire):** These units typically focus on strong cleaning power and efficient cycles. They also offer a good balance of features and cost.
*   **GE Appliances (Haier):** Often provide reliable, straightforward performance. They focus on practicality and robust build quality.

Each manufacturer contributes unique aspects to the Kenmore brand. This variety is what makes Kenmore a diverse product line. It also means you must look past the Kenmore label. You need to find the actual manufacturer. This helps you understand your appliance better. My own research has shown that different makers have their strengths. This influences performance and durability. It also explains why some Kenmore units vary widely in features.

## Identifying Your Kenmore Dishwasher's True Manufacturer

Finding out who made your Kenmore dishwasher is straightforward. The key lies in its model number. Every appliance has a unique model number. This number provides important details. It often includes codes that identify the manufacturer.

**Steps to find the model number:**

1.  **Open the dishwasher door.**
2.  **Look along the edges of the door.** You might find a sticker or plate there.
3.  **Check the side of the inner tub.** Sometimes the sticker is on the left or right side.
4.  **Find the "Model No." or "P/N" (Part Number).** Write it down accurately.

Once you have the model number, you can use online resources. Many websites offer model number lookup tools. These tools cross-reference the Kenmore number with known manufacturer codes. A common identifier is the first three digits of the model number. For example, "665" often points to Whirlpool. "587" typically indicates Frigidaire (Electrolux). "790" often means GE Appliances. "363" might point to a different manufacturer.

Knowing the actual manufacturer is helpful. It assists with ordering parts. It also helps when you troubleshoot issues. If your [Kenmore dishwasher is not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kenmore-dishwasher-not-drain), knowing the maker guides you. You can look up specific diagrams or solutions. This information empowers you as a homeowner. It helps you maintain your appliances effectively. I always recommend this step to anyone with a Kenmore appliance. It clears up much of the mystery.

## Performance and Features: Whirlpool vs. Other Kenmore Makers

The performance and features of a Kenmore dishwasher largely depend on its true manufacturer. While Kenmore sets certain specifications, the underlying design and technology come from the producing company. This means a Whirlpool-made Kenmore might share characteristics with a standard Whirlpool dishwasher. Similarly, an LG-made Kenmore will likely reflect LG's innovations.

Whirlpool-made Kenmore dishwashers often focus on reliability and straightforward cleaning cycles. They commonly feature a robust wash system and effective drying. You might find familiar cycles like "Sensor Wash" or "Heavy Duty." Their designs often emphasize durability and ease of use. This can make them a good option for many homes. Many consider Whirlpool to make [good dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-are-good-dishwashers) that last a long time.

In contrast, Kenmore models made by LG often bring more advanced features. These can include steam cycles for tough stains or very quiet operation. They might have sleek, modern interfaces. Electrolux-made Kenmore units often prioritize powerful washing and efficient water use. GE Appliances-made models typically focus on practicality and solid performance. Each manufacturer offers its own signature. This influences the overall user experience. It impacts everything from wash cycles to noise levels.

Understanding these differences is important. It helps you set expectations for your dishwasher. It also guides you if you are looking to replace your current unit. My personal experience confirms that these manufacturing differences are noticeable. They affect how the appliance performs daily. It also affects the [amount of water a Kenmore dishwasher uses](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-water-does-a-kenmore-dishwasher-use).

## The Evolution of Kenmore in the Appliance Market

The appliance market has changed significantly over time. The Kenmore brand has also evolved. For decades, Kenmore was a powerhouse. It was sold exclusively through Sears and Kmart stores. However, Sears faced financial challenges. This greatly impacted the Kenmore brand's presence.

As Sears stores closed, Kenmore had to find new ways to reach customers. They began selling their appliances through other retailers. Today, you can find Kenmore products at various outlets. These include Amazon, Lowe's, and other independent appliance dealers. This shift helps the brand stay relevant. It adapts to the changing retail landscape.

The manufacturing partnerships also continue to evolve. As the market changes, so do the agreements between Kenmore and its suppliers. Some manufacturers may reduce their involvement. New ones may step in. This ongoing change means the question "Does Whirlpool make Kenmore dishwashers?" will always have a dynamic answer. The brand aims to continue offering value to consumers. It does this by adapting its distribution and supply chain. This resilience shows the lasting power of the Kenmore name.

## Making an Informed Dishwasher Purchase Decision

Buying a new dishwasher is an important household decision. Knowing about the Kenmore brand's manufacturing model helps you choose wisely. Do not just rely on the Kenmore name alone. Research the actual manufacturer of the specific model you consider. This gives you deeper insight into its quality and features.

Here are key considerations when buying a new dishwasher:

*   **Budget:** Determine how much you can spend. Prices vary widely based on features and brand.
*   **Features:** What do you need? Do you want a third rack, adjustable tines, or a specific wash cycle?
*   **Noise Level:** Dishwashers are measured in decibels (dBA). Lower numbers mean quieter operation. A quiet dishwasher is a big plus, especially in open-concept homes.
*   **Energy Efficiency:** Look for ENERGY STAR certification. This saves you money on utility bills.
*   **Reliability:** Check reviews and ratings for the specific model. Try to find out its true manufacturer. This provides context.
*   **Brand Reputation:** Consider the reputation of the actual manufacturer. Brands like Bosch and Samsung are known for different strengths. You can check if [Samsung makes good dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-samsung-make-good-dishwashers) or if [Bosch makes good dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-bosch-make-good-dishwashers) to compare.

It also helps with parts availability. Ultimately, a well-researched purchase leads to greater satisfaction. It ensures your new dishwasher meets your specific needs. My advice is always to look beyond the badge. Investigate the product itself. This leads to the best decisions.
