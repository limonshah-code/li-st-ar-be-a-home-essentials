### Unexpected Desserts and Sweet Treats

Did you know your outdoor pizza oven can bake desserts? It is true. The oven's high heat can produce delicious sweet treats. You might need to let the oven cool down first. Ideal dessert temperatures are usually lower than pizza heat. Think around 350-450°F (175-230°C). This allows for slower baking. It prevents burning the sugar.
