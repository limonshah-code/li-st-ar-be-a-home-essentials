Have you noticed your Samsung dishwasher leaving food particles on dishes? Perhaps you see standing water at the bottom of the tub after a cycle finishes. These issues often point to a clogged filter. Specifically, the pump filter might be the culprit. Cleaning this part is important for your dishwasher to work properly. This guide will show you how to clean your Samsung dishwasher pump filter. We will cover finding the filter, taking it out, cleaning it, and putting it back. You will learn steps to make your dishwasher clean dishes again.

### Takeaway

### Main Query Answer

You clean a Samsung dishwasher pump filter by first removing the lower dish rack and spray arm. Then, twist and lift out the main filter and fine mesh filter. Rinse these parts under running water to remove food debris. Check the area around the pump for blockages and clear them. Finally, reassemble all parts.

## Understanding Your Samsung Dishwasher's Filtration System

Your Samsung dishwasher has a system of filters. These filters trap food particles and debris. This keeps them from going into the drain pump. It stops them from recirculating onto your dishes. The main filter is often a two-part assembly. It has a coarse filter and a fine mesh filter.

Underneath these filters lies access to the drain pump area. While the pump itself is not usually cleaned directly, the screen protecting it often collects debris. This screen is what many people refer to when they talk about the "pump filter." A clean filter system helps the dishwasher drain water correctly. It also ensures proper water circulation for cleaning dishes.

If you skip cleaning these filters, problems start to happen. Food bits can build up. This blocks water flow. It stops the dishwasher from draining well. This means your dishes may not get clean. It also causes bad smells inside the dishwasher. Understanding where these filters are helps you clean them. You can find more details on finding your filter.

## Signs of a Clogged Samsung Dishwasher Pump Filter

Your dishwasher shows clear signs when its pump filter needs cleaning. Spotting these signs early helps prevent bigger issues. One common sign is dishes that do not come out clean. You might see food residue or grit on them after a cycle. This means dirty water is recirculating. The filter is not catching particles.

Another strong indicator is standing water. After a wash cycle finishes, water remains at the bottom of the tub. This happens because the clogged pump filter prevents proper drainage. The water cannot exit the dishwasher. This also leads to foul odors. Stagnant water and trapped food particles start to smell bad over time.

You might also notice unusual noises during the wash cycle. A struggling drain pump due to a blockage can make humming or grinding sounds. The dishwasher also might not drain at all. This leaves a full tub of dirty water. Addressing these signs quickly keeps your dishwasher working well. It prevents further damage to the pump.

## Essential Tools and Safety Before You Start

Before you start cleaning, gather a few simple tools. These tools make the job easier and safer. You will need a soft-bristle brush. An old toothbrush works well for scrubbing. You also need mild dish soap or white vinegar. A few paper towels or a cloth are helpful for wiping up spills. A flashlight can help you see into dark areas.

Safety is important for any appliance repair or maintenance. Always disconnect the power to your dishwasher first. You can unplug it from the wall outlet. Or you can turn off the circuit breaker that controls the dishwasher. This prevents electric shock. It also prevents the dishwasher from starting accidentally.

Make sure the dishwasher is cool. Do not attempt cleaning right after a hot wash cycle. Let it cool down completely. Protect your hands if you wish. You can wear rubber gloves. This is good for handling dirty parts. It also protects against any sharp edges. Having everything ready ensures a smooth and safe cleaning process.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Accessing the Pump Filter

Accessing the pump filter involves removing a few components. Follow these steps carefully to reach the filter assembly. Your dishwasher should be empty. It should be cool and have its power off.

### Empty the Dishwasher and Remove Racks

First, open the dishwasher door. Remove all dishes, silverware, and other items from both the upper and lower racks. Take out the lower dish rack completely. Lift it slightly and pull it straight out of the tub. This gives you clear access to the bottom of the dishwasher. The filter assembly sits on the tub floor.

### Remove the Lower Spray Arm

The lower spray arm usually sits above the filter. You need to remove it to access the filter assembly. Most Samsung models have a lower spray arm that simply lifts off. Some might require unscrewing a cap first.

*   **For lift-off models:** Gently lift the spray arm straight up. It should detach from its mounting post.
*   **For screw-on models:** Locate the cap in the center of the spray arm. Turn it counter-clockwise to loosen it. Then, lift the spray arm off.

Place the spray arm aside carefully. Do not damage the nozzle openings. You are now closer to the filter assembly.

### Access the Filter Assembly

The filter assembly is located in the center of the dishwasher tub floor. It typically looks like a cylindrical component. It may have a handle or tabs on top.

*   **Twist to unlock:** Most Samsung filters unlock by twisting them. Grab the top part of the filter assembly. Turn it counter-clockwise. You will feel it loosen.
*   **Lift out the assembly:** Once unlocked, gently lift the entire filter assembly straight up and out of the dishwasher tub.

The filter assembly usually consists of two parts. There is an outer coarse filter. Inside it is a fine mesh cylindrical filter. You may need to separate these two parts for thorough cleaning.

## Detailed Cleaning of Your Samsung Dishwasher Pump Filter

Once you have removed the filter assembly, it is time for a thorough cleaning. The goal is to remove all trapped food particles, grease, and grime. This restores proper water flow and drainage.

### Rinse Under Running Water

Take the separated filter parts to a sink. Rinse each part under strong running water. Use warm water to help loosen grease. Many food particles will wash away easily. You might see a surprising amount of debris. Pay attention to the mesh screens. Ensure water flows through them freely.

### Scrub Stubborn Buildup

Some food particles and grease can stick firmly to the filter. For these, you need to scrub.

*   **Use a soft brush:** Take your soft-bristle brush or old toothbrush. Gently scrub all surfaces of the filter parts. Focus on the mesh and crevices where debris collects.
*   **Apply mild soap or vinegar:** For tougher grime, apply a small amount of mild dish soap to the brush. Or, you can use white vinegar. Scrub the filter with the soap or vinegar. This helps break down grease and remove odors.
*   **Rinse thoroughly again:** After scrubbing, rinse the filter parts under running water once more. Make sure all soap or vinegar residue is gone. The filter should look clean and free of debris.

### Inspect the Pump Screen Area

After removing the main filter assembly, you will see the pump intake screen. This screen sits directly above the drain pump. It acts as a last line of defense. It prevents larger items from entering the pump impeller.

*   **Use a flashlight:** Shine a flashlight into the opening where the filter sat. Look for any visible food particles, glass shards, or other debris.
*   **Carefully remove blockages:** If you see any blockages, carefully remove them. You can use your fingers if safe. Or use a pair of needle-nose pliers or tweezers for hard-to-reach items. Be gentle. Do not push debris further into the pump. Do not damage the screen or surrounding parts.

## Reassembling and Testing Your Samsung Dishwasher

After cleaning all parts, it is time to put your Samsung dishwasher back together. Proper reassembly ensures the filter system works correctly. It also prevents leaks.

### Place Filters Back in Order

Start by inserting the fine mesh filter back into the coarse filter. Make sure they fit together snugly. Then, lower the assembled filter unit into its opening in the dishwasher tub floor.

*   **Align and twist:** Align the tabs or markings on the filter assembly with the corresponding slots in the tub. Push it down gently. Then, twist the filter clockwise until it locks into place. You should feel a click or resistance. This confirms it is secure. A loose filter can cause leaks or poor performance.

### Reattach the Lower Spray Arm

Next, reattach the lower spray arm.

*   **Align and press:** Place the spray arm back onto its mounting post in the center of the tub.
*   **Secure the arm:** If it is a lift-off model, gently press it down until it clicks into place. If it is a screw-on type, turn the cap clockwise until it is finger-tight. Ensure the spray arm spins freely without obstruction.

### Replace the Dishwasher Racks

Slide the lower dish rack back into its tracks. Push it all the way in. If you removed the upper rack, put it back too. Ensure all racks move smoothly.

### Run a Test Cycle

Once everything is back in place, restore power to the dishwasher. Close the door. Select a short, empty wash cycle. A "Rinse Only" or "Light Wash" cycle works well. Start the cycle.

*   **Check for proper drainage:** Listen for normal operation. Watch for standing water at the end of the cycle. The tub should be completely empty and dry.
*   **Observe cleaning performance:** If you ran a wash cycle, note if the spray arms are working correctly. Check the cleanliness of the tub interior.

This test confirms that your cleaning efforts were successful. It shows the pump filter system is now working as it should. If you need a reminder on filter reinstallation, check out [how to put your dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in).

## Routine Maintenance for Optimal Dishwasher Performance

Cleaning your Samsung dishwasher pump filter is a key part of regular appliance maintenance. But it is not a one-time job. Regular cleaning prevents future issues. It also keeps your dishwasher running efficiently for years.

### Cleaning Frequency Recommendations

The frequency of cleaning depends on your dishwasher usage. It also depends on what you wash.

*   **Weekly Check:** I like to quickly check my filter once a week. I look for large food pieces. I can remove them by hand if I see them.
*   **Monthly Rinse:** For most households, rinsing the filter assembly once a month is a good routine. This helps remove general buildup.
*   **Quarterly Deep Clean:** Every three months, I suggest a deeper clean. This means taking the filter apart. You should scrub it with soap or vinegar. Also, check the pump screen area for any hidden debris.

Households that use their dishwasher daily might need to clean the filter more often. Large families or those who often wash dishes with heavy food residue should clean it every two to three weeks.

### Prevention Tips

You can do things to prevent the filter from getting clogged quickly.

*   **Scrape plates:** Scrape large food scraps off plates before loading them. You do not need to pre-rinse, but remove solid pieces.
*   **Avoid certain items:** Do not wash items with excessive starch or sticky residues. These can clog the filter fast.
*   **Run hot cycles:** Occasionally run a hot water cycle with a dishwasher cleaner. This helps dissolve grease and detergent buildup.
*   **Check for foreign objects:** Before starting a cycle, quickly check the bottom of the tub. Make sure no small items like toothpicks or labels fell in. These can bypass the filter and damage the pump.

Following these tips helps maintain a clean pump filter. It ensures your Samsung dishwasher performs its best. If you find your dishwasher filter full of water often, this points to persistent drain issues that cleaning can often resolve.

## FAQ Section

### Why is my Samsung dishwasher not draining completely?

Your Samsung dishwasher likely is not draining completely due to a clogged pump filter or drain hose. Food debris builds up on the filter. This stops water from reaching the drain pump effectively. Check the filter first. Clear any visible blockages. Also, ensure the drain hose is not kinked or blocked.

### How often should I clean the pump filter in my Samsung dishwasher?

Clean the pump filter in your Samsung dishwasher at least once a month. If you use your dishwasher daily or wash heavily soiled dishes, clean it every two to three weeks. A quick rinse under the faucet is often enough for routine maintenance. A deeper scrub is needed quarterly.

### Can I run my Samsung dishwasher without the pump filter?

No, you should never run your Samsung dishwasher without the pump filter installed. The filter protects the drain pump from food particles and debris. Running the dishwasher without it allows large items to enter the pump. This can cause severe damage. It can lead to expensive repairs.

You need only a few basic tools to clean your Samsung dishwasher pump filter. A soft-bristle brush, like an old toothbrush, is useful for scrubbing. Mild dish soap or white vinegar helps remove grease. Paper towels or a cloth are good for cleanup. A flashlight helps you see into dark areas.

### What if my dishwasher still has issues after cleaning the filter?

If your dishwasher still has issues after cleaning the filter, the problem may be elsewhere. Check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. Inspect the spray arms for clogged nozzles. The drain pump itself might be faulty. In some cases, a professional appliance technician might be needed to diagnose and fix the issue.
