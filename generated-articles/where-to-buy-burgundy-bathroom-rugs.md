### Etsy: Unique Handcrafted Burgundy Rugs

For something truly special, look at Etsy. This platform hosts independent sellers and artisans. You might find unique, handmade burgundy bathroom rugs here. Many sellers offer custom sizes or designs. This allows for a truly personalized touch.

While prices might be higher, the quality and uniqueness often justify the cost. You support small businesses when you buy from Etsy. I love discovering one-of-a-kind items that make my home feel unique. Just remember to check seller reviews and shipping policies.

## Major Department Stores and Home Goods Chains

Sometimes, seeing and feeling a rug before buying it is important. Physical stores offer this advantage. You can check the color against your existing bathroom decor. You can also assess the softness and thickness in person. I often visit these stores for inspiration.

### Macy's & Kohl's: Reliable Choices

Department stores like Macy's and Kohl's carry a range of home textiles. They often have dedicated sections for bath linens and rugs. You can find burgundy options from well-known brands. These brands often ensure consistent quality.

These stores frequently run promotions and sales. Signing up for their email lists can alert you to discounts. I appreciate being able to touch the rug to feel its texture. This helps me decide if it will be comfortable underfoot. They provide a good balance of quality and accessibility for finding items like [modern bathroom rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-to-buy-modern-bathroom-rugs) in burgundy shades.

### Target & Walmart: Affordable Options

If you are on a budget, Target and Walmart are excellent choices. They offer a wide selection of bathroom rugs at competitive prices. You can often find burgundy bath mats in various materials and sizes. These stores make it easy to update your bathroom without spending a lot.

Their stock changes regularly, so visit often or check their websites for new arrivals. I have found surprisingly good quality rugs here for very reasonable prices. They are perfect for rental properties or if you like to change your decor frequently. You can usually find matching towels and shower curtains here too.

## Specialty Home Decor Boutiques and Luxury Brands

For those seeking premium quality or unique designs, specialty stores and luxury brands are the way to go. These places often offer rugs made with higher-end materials. They also feature exclusive patterns. I consider these options when I want to invest in a long-lasting, statement piece.

### Pottery Barn & Crate & Barrel: Premium Quality

Pottery Barn and Crate & Barrel are known for their stylish and durable home furnishings. They offer a curated selection of bathroom rugs. While their burgundy options might be fewer, they are typically of excellent quality. The materials are often plush and luxurious.

These stores focus on classic and sophisticated designs. Their rugs are built to last and withstand frequent use. I often find inspiration in their showrooms. They display rugs as part of a complete bathroom setup. This helps visualize how a burgundy rug will look in a finished space.

### Local Boutiques: Unique Finds

Small, local home decor boutiques are hidden gems. They often stock unique items not found in larger chains. You might discover handcrafted burgundy rugs or those from niche designers. These pieces can add character and individuality to your bathroom.

Supporting local businesses also feels good. The staff in boutiques often provide personalized service. They can offer great advice on styling and care. It is worth exploring your town for these charming shops. You never know what treasure you might find.

## Exploring Material and Style for Your Burgundy Rugs

The material and style of your burgundy bathroom rug greatly impact its feel and function. Consider how much traffic your bathroom gets. Think about how often you plan to wash the rug. The right choice ensures both comfort and longevity. Understanding these aspects helps you choose wisely.

### Plush Microfiber and Cotton: Comfort and Absorbency

Microfiber rugs are very soft and highly absorbent. They dry quickly, which is ideal for a bathroom environment. These rugs feel luxurious underfoot. Cotton rugs are also popular for their natural feel and absorbency. They are usually easy to wash.

Both materials come in various pile heights. A higher pile offers more softness. A lower pile may dry faster. I prefer microfiber for its quick-drying properties. It helps prevent mildew buildup in humid bathrooms. Many burgundy bathroom rugs feature these materials. They offer both comfort and practicality. You might find ideas similar to [what rug style go with burgundy persian](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-rug-style-go-with-burgundy-persian) to ensure your burgundy rug fits your overall design.

### Jute and Chenille: Texture and Durability

Jute rugs offer a natural, textured look. They are durable and eco-friendly. However, jute is less absorbent than cotton or microfiber. It might be better suited for areas around the vanity, not directly by the shower. Chenille rugs are soft and have a slight sheen. They add a touch of elegance.

Chenille is also quite durable and absorbs water well. It often has a luxurious feel. I like how different textures can add depth to a bathroom's design. When selecting, think about how the rug will interact with moisture. A durable option will last longer. Remember to check how to [clean bathroom rugs](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bathroom-rugs) for your chosen material.

## Tips for Buying the Best Burgundy Bathroom Rugs

Making the right choice for your burgundy bathroom rugs involves more than just color. You need to consider practical aspects like size, safety, and quality. These tips will help you make an informed decision. I always keep these points in mind when shopping for my home.

### Size and Shape Considerations

Measure your bathroom space before you buy. Think about where the rug will go. A single large rug can define an area. A set of smaller rugs can be placed in front of the sink, shower, and toilet. Make sure the rug does not obstruct door swings.

Consider the shape as well. Rectangular rugs are common. Round or contour rugs fit around specific fixtures. I once bought a rug that was too big for my small bathroom. It made the space feel cramped. Learning from that, I always measure first.

### Non-Slip Backing is Key

Safety is paramount in a bathroom. Water and smooth floors can create slip hazards. Always choose burgundy bathroom rugs with a non-slip backing. Rubber or latex backings are common and effective. This prevents the rug from sliding on tile or linoleum.

If your chosen rug does not have a non-slip backing, buy a separate rug pad. This provides extra grip. It also adds a bit more cushioning. I prioritize safety features for all my bathroom mats. For more details on this, check out [how to keep bathroom rugs from sliding](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-bathroom-rugs-from-sliding). It is a simple step that can prevent accidents.

### Reading Product Reviews

Customer reviews offer real-world insights into a product. They often cover details like true color, softness, and how well it washes. Look for reviews that mention fading, shedding, or durability issues. A high number of positive reviews usually indicates a good product.

I always read both positive and negative reviews. This gives me a balanced perspective. It helps me decide if the rug meets my expectations for a burgundy bath mat. Sometimes, reviews also include helpful photos from other buyers.

## Caring for Your Burgundy Bathroom Rugs

Proper care keeps your burgundy bathroom rugs looking vibrant and fresh. Regular cleaning is essential for hygiene and longevity. Burgundy is a dark color, but it can still show dirt and dust over time. Following care instructions helps maintain its rich hue.

### Regular Cleaning and Maintenance

Most bathroom rugs are machine washable. Check the care label for specific instructions. I recommend washing burgundy rugs separately to avoid color bleeding onto other items. Use cold water and a gentle cycle. Tumble dry on low heat or air dry to prevent shrinking and preserve the backing.

Shake your rugs outside weekly to remove loose dirt and debris. This simple step reduces the amount of dirt that gets embedded in the fibers. It also keeps your bathroom cleaner between washes. Consistent care ensures your rugs remain soft and absorbent. For general guidance, read [how often should you wash your bathroom rugs](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-wash-your-bathroom-rugs).

### Stain Removal Tips

Accidents happen in bathrooms. For small spills, blot the area immediately with a clean cloth. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. For tougher stains, use a mild detergent mixed with water. Apply it to the stained area and gently blot.

Rinse the spot thoroughly with water. Make sure no soap residue remains. This can attract more dirt. For persistent stains or deep cleaning, consider professional cleaning for high-quality rugs. Always test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area first. This prevents damage to the rug's color or material. If you have dirty rugs, knowing [how to clean dirty bathroom rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dirty-bathroom-rugs) is very helpful.

## Styling Your Bathroom with Burgundy Accents

Burgundy is a strong color. It adds character and warmth to a bathroom. Knowing how to style it ensures a cohesive and appealing look. Your burgundy bathroom rugs can be the starting point for a beautiful design. I enjoy experimenting with different color combinations.

### Complementary Color Palettes

Burgundy pairs well with many colors. For a classic look, combine it with creams, ivories, or light grays. These neutral shades create balance. For a richer, more dramatic effect, pair burgundy with deep greens, navy blues, or even gold accents. Metallic finishes like brushed gold or brass can also enhance the warmth.

I find that white fixtures always look crisp against burgundy. It makes the space feel clean and inviting. Consider painting one wall a complementary color. This can tie the whole room together. The key is to create harmony. Think about how [what rugs go with a burgundy persian](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-rugs-go-with-a-burgundy-persian) might inform your choices, even if you are not using a Persian rug.

### Beyond the Rug: Towels and Accessories

Extend the burgundy theme beyond the rug. Add matching towels, hand towels, or washcloths. You can also incorporate burgundy in shower curtains or window treatments. Small accessories like soap dispensers, toothbrush holders, or decorative trays can carry the color.

Do not overdo it, though. A few well-placed burgundy items are more effective than too many. Use the color as an accent. This creates a sophisticated and curated appearance. I like to balance solid burgundy items with patterns that include the color. This adds visual interest.

## FAQ Section

### What colors pair well with burgundy bathroom rugs?
Burgundy bathroom rugs look great with neutral colors like cream, ivory, beige, and light gray. For a bolder look, pair them with deep greens, navy blue, gold, or even certain shades of teal. White fixtures provide a crisp contrast.

### How do I choose the right size burgundy rug for my bathroom?
Measure your bathroom floor space carefully. Consider the areas in front of your sink, shower, and toilet. Ensure the rug does not impede door swings. A single large rug can anchor the room. Smaller individual rugs work well in specific zones.

### Are burgundy bathroom rugs hard to keep clean?
Burgundy rugs are generally not harder to clean than other colors. Being a darker shade, they might hide minor dirt or lint better. Regular shaking and machine washing according to care instructions are usually sufficient to keep them fresh and vibrant.

### Can I use outdoor rugs in my bathroom?
Generally, no. Outdoor rugs are designed for durability and weather resistance, but they often lack the softness and absorbency needed for a bathroom. They may also not have a proper non-slip backing, which is crucial for bathroom safety. For more, see [can you put an outdoor rugs in a bathroom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-an-outdoor-rugs-in-a-bathroom).

### What materials are best for absorbent burgundy bath mats?
Microfiber and cotton are excellent choices for absorbent burgundy bath mats. Microfiber is known for its quick-drying properties and plush feel. Cotton offers natural absorbency and softness. Both are comfortable underfoot and easy to maintain.

### How often should I replace my burgundy bathroom rugs?
You should replace your burgundy bathroom rugs every 1-2 years, especially if they are used daily. Signs like fading color, matted pile, frayed edges, or a worn-out non-slip backing indicate it is time for a new set. Regular washing extends their life.
