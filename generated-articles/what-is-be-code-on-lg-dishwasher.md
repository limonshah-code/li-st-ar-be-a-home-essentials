The "BE" code on your LG dishwasher signals a problem with the circulation motor. This motor powers the wash arms. It means the motor is either not spinning correctly or not getting proper power. Issues can range from simple blockages to more complex electrical faults within the motor or its control circuit.

### What the BE Code Signifies on Your LG Dishwasher

The "BE" error code on your LG dishwasher specifically points to an issue with the circulation motor. This motor is a very important part. It pushes water through the spray arms to clean your dishes. When this code appears, it means the dishwasher's control board detects that the motor is either not running at all, running too slowly, or drawing incorrect power. It is a sign of a motor overload or a motor malfunction. I know it can be frustrating to see this code. But understanding its meaning is the first step toward a solution.

The circulation motor is often called the wash motor or pump motor. It works hard during every wash cycle. If the motor struggles, due to a blockage or an electrical fault, the control board senses this trouble. It then displays the "BE" code. This code serves as a protective measure. It stops the dishwasher from running under conditions that could damage the motor further. So, the code tells you exactly where to focus your attention.

Sometimes, the issue is not the motor itself, but something stopping the motor from spinning freely. This could be a small piece of food debris or a foreign object. Other times, the electrical connection to the motor might be loose or damaged. A faulty main control board can also cause this code, but motor-related problems are far more common. My experience tells me that these issues often have straightforward solutions. You can usually fix them without calling a professional. Let us dive deeper into the common reasons why your dishwasher might be showing this particular code.

### Common Causes Behind the LG Dishwasher BE Error

Several factors can cause the "BE" error code to appear on your LG dishwasher. Understanding these common causes helps you pinpoint the exact problem. The most frequent culprits involve the circulation motor itself. Sometimes, something jams the motor, stopping it from spinning properly. This could be a small piece of food or a broken dish shard.

Another common cause is the motor's internal components. Over time, the motor can wear out. Bearings might seize, or windings might fail. If the motor tries to start but cannot, it draws too much current, triggering the "BE" code. This means the motor is overworked. It cannot perform its normal function.

Wiring issues also play a role. The wires connecting the motor to the main control board can become loose. They might also get damaged. A frayed or disconnected wire prevents the motor from receiving the correct power. This leads to the error code. I have seen many cases where a simple wire check solves the problem. It is an easy thing to look for first.

Finally, while less common, a faulty main control board can misinterpret signals. It might send incorrect commands to the motor. Or it might incorrectly detect a motor fault. If the board itself is bad, it can cause the "BE" code even if the motor is fine. Always consider this possibility if other checks do not reveal the problem. My advice is to check the easier things first before considering a control board issue.

### Initial Troubleshooting Steps for the BE Code

When your LG dishwasher shows the "BE" code, begin with simple troubleshooting steps. These steps can often resolve the issue quickly. They do not require any special tools. First, perform a hard reset. Unplug your dishwasher from the wall outlet. Wait for about five to ten minutes. Then plug it back in. This step can clear temporary glitches in the control board. It often resolves many error codes. I always start here because it is quick and easy.

Next, check for any visible blockages. Open the dishwasher door. Look inside the tub at the drain filter assembly. Remove the lower spray arm and then the filter. Inspect the filter and the area beneath it for food debris, small objects, or anything that might obstruct the circulation pump. A clogged filter or a blocked impeller can prevent the motor from working correctly. Use a flashlight if needed to see clearly into the pump housing. Clearing an obstruction here might immediately fix the problem. This is a common solution.

You should also check the dishwasher's power supply. Ensure the dishwasher has a steady power connection. Sometimes, power fluctuations can cause error codes. Make sure the outlet is working correctly. You can test it with another appliance if you have doubts. Also, make sure the dishwasher door latches properly. The dishwasher will not run if the door is not fully closed. This simple check can sometimes be overlooked. Performing these initial steps can save you time and potentially a service call.

### Diagnosing and Fixing Motor-Related BE Errors

If the initial troubleshooting steps do not clear the "BE" code, the problem likely lies with the circulation motor itself. Diagnosing motor issues requires a bit more effort. You will need to access the motor, which is typically located underneath the dishwasher tub. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before you start any repair work. Safety is paramount when working with appliances.

#### Checking the Circulation Pump Impeller

First, examine the circulation pump impeller for obstructions. The impeller is inside the pump housing, connected to the motor. Over time, small items like broken glass, seeds, or even small bones can get past the filter. These items can jam the impeller. If the impeller cannot spin freely, the motor overloads and triggers the "BE" code. You may need to remove the lower spray arm and possibly the pump assembly cover to gain full access. Carefully remove any foreign objects you find. Turn the impeller by hand to ensure it spins freely after clearing.

#### Inspecting Motor Connections

Next, inspect the electrical connections at the motor. Look for any loose or corroded wires. Ensure all wire harnesses are securely plugged into the motor and the control board. Sometimes, vibrations can cause connections to loosen over time. If you find any loose connections, firmly reattach them. If you see any signs of damage, such as burnt wires or connectors, this indicates a more serious electrical issue. Such damage means the motor or the wiring harness might need replacement. This type of damage requires careful handling.

If the impeller is clear and connections are secure, but the motor still does not run, the motor itself might be faulty. You can test the motor's windings for continuity using a multimeter. If the motor shows an open circuit or incorrect resistance, it needs replacement. Replacing a dishwasher circulation motor can be a complex task. It often involves disconnecting water lines and carefully removing the entire motor assembly. If you are not comfortable with this type of repair, I highly recommend calling a professional appliance technician. It can save you from further damage or injury.

### Addressing Electrical and Control Board Issues for BE Code

After checking the motor for blockages and obvious mechanical faults, if the "BE" code persists, the problem might stem from electrical issues or the control board. These components are vital for the dishwasher's operation. They require a more systematic approach to diagnose. Always ensure the dishwasher is unplugged before inspecting electrical components.

Begin by thoroughly examining the entire wiring harness that connects the circulation motor to the main control board. Look for any signs of physical damage. This includes cuts, pinches, or frayed insulation. Wires can sometimes get chafed against the dishwasher's metal frame. Or they can be damaged during other repairs. Pay close attention to the points where wires connect to terminals. These areas are prone to corrosion or loosening. If you find any damaged wires, they need replacement. Do not attempt to splice damaged wires, as this can create a fire hazard.

You can also use a multimeter to test the continuity of the wires. This helps you confirm if power is flowing correctly through the circuit. An open circuit indicates a break in the wire. This means the motor is not receiving power. This process requires some electrical knowledge and a multimeter. If you are unsure how to do this, consider consulting a professional.

Finally, consider the main control board. This board is the "brain" of your dishwasher. It sends signals to the motor and interprets feedback. A faulty control board can incorrectly signal a "BE" code even if the motor is fine. Visually inspect the control board for any signs of damage. Look for burnt components, bulging capacitors, or discolored areas. These are clear indicators of a failing board. If the board appears damaged or if all other checks yield no results, replacing the main control board might be necessary. This is usually the last resort, as control boards can be expensive. For complex electrical repairs, or if you are uncomfortable working with internal components, I strongly advise contacting a certified appliance technician. They have the expertise to safely diagnose and fix these issues.

### Preventive Maintenance to Avoid LG Dishwasher BE Code

Taking care of your LG dishwasher can help prevent common error codes like "BE." Regular maintenance is not just about cleaning. It is about keeping all parts working smoothly. Prevention is always better than cure. I recommend establishing a simple routine. This will extend the life of your appliance.

First, regularly clean your dishwasher's filter. This is perhaps the most important preventive step. The filter traps food particles and debris. If it gets too dirty, it can restrict water flow. This puts extra strain on the circulation pump motor. A strained motor is more likely to overheat or get jammed, leading to the "BE" code. I clean my filter at least once a month, sometimes more if I use the dishwasher frequently. Follow your LG manual for specific filter cleaning instructions. You can learn more about general cleaning practices in our article on [how to clean an LG dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-an-lg-dishwasher).

Second, scrape off large food scraps from dishes before loading them. Do not pre-rinse, but do remove chunks that could clog the drain or pump. Large food pieces, bones, or small foreign objects can easily get past the filter and jam the impeller. This directly leads to a motor overload or blockage, triggering the "BE" code. A quick scrape prevents these incidents.

Third, avoid overloading your dishwasher. Packing too many dishes can prevent water from circulating properly. This makes the motor work harder. It also means dishes do not get clean. Give your dishes space. This allows water to reach all surfaces and reduces strain on the motor.

Fourth, run hot water at your kitchen sink before starting the dishwasher. This ensures that the water entering the dishwasher is already hot. Hot water helps dissolve detergent and grease more effectively. This reduces the chances of residue building up inside the pump or motor. Cold water can leave behind stubborn deposits.

Finally, occasionally inspect the spray arms. Make sure their holes are clear. Blocked holes can also affect water circulation. Use a toothpick to clear any clogs. By following these simple maintenance tips, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering the "BE" error code. You will also help your LG dishwasher run efficiently for years to come.

### When to Call a Professional for Your BE Code Issue

While many "BE" code issues on LG dishwashers are fixable with DIY methods, some situations warrant calling a professional. Knowing when to seek expert help can save you time, money, and potential headaches. I always advise prioritizing safety. If you feel uncomfortable working with electrical components or disassembling your appliance, it is time to call a technician.

One clear sign to call a pro is if you have performed all the basic troubleshooting steps and the "BE" code persists. If you have reset the dishwasher, cleared the filter, checked for obvious blockages, and inspected visible wiring, but the code still appears, the problem is likely deeper. It could indicate a faulty motor that needs replacement. Or it might be a complex electrical issue that requires diagnostic tools. Most homeowners do not have these tools.

Another reason to call a professional is if you encounter any signs of electrical damage. This includes burnt wires, melted connectors, or a burning smell. These issues can be dangerous. They pose a fire risk. Do not attempt to fix them yourself unless you are a qualified electrician. A professional technician has the training and equipment to safely handle these repairs. They can prevent further damage to your appliance or home.

Furthermore, if your LG dishwasher is still under warranty, contact LG customer support or a certified service center. Attempting to repair the appliance yourself might void the warranty. A professional service ensures that the repair is done correctly and by authorized personnel. This keeps your warranty intact. They can provide genuine LG parts for replacement. My general rule is, if the repair involves complex disassembly, specialized tools, or high-voltage components, it's best left to the experts. They offer peace of mind.
