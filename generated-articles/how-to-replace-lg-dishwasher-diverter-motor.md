A faulty LG dishwasher diverter motor prevents water from reaching all spray arms, causing dirty dishes. You can replace this motor by disconnecting power and water, accessing the dishwasher's underside, removing the old motor, and installing a new one. This restores proper water distribution and cleaning performance.

## Understanding Your LG Dishwasher Diverter Motor's Role

The LG dishwasher diverter motor is a crucial component. It directs the flow of water to different spray arms. Dishwashers clean dishes in cycles. During these cycles, water needs to spray from various points. Some cycles might focus water on the lower rack. Other cycles might send water to the upper rack. The diverter motor makes this happen.

Think of it as a switch for water paths. The diverter motor has a shaft with a valve or impeller. This valve rotates to open and close specific water channels. For example, it sends water to the lower spray arm during one phase. Then, it might rotate to send water to the upper spray arm. This ensures all dishes receive proper washing. Without a working diverter motor, water distribution becomes uneven. This leads to certain dishes remaining dirty.

LG dishwashers rely on this precise water delivery. The diverter motor ensures that every part of the wash tub gets cleaned. Over time, these motors can wear out. Internal gears might strip. Electrical windings can fail. Debris can also jam the mechanism. A common sign of failure is that one rack of dishes cleans well, but the other does not. You might also hear a buzzing or grinding noise from the bottom of the dishwasher. Understanding its function helps diagnose issues.

## Signs Your LG Dishwasher Diverter Motor Needs Replacement

Knowing when to replace your LG dishwasher diverter motor saves you time and frustration. Specific symptoms point to its failure. The most common sign is uneven cleaning performance. You might notice that dishes on the top rack are clean, but those on the bottom rack are not, or vice versa. This indicates that water is not reaching one of the spray zones. The diverter motor cannot direct water correctly.

Another strong indicator is unusual noise during a wash cycle. You might hear grinding, buzzing, or clicking sounds coming from the bottom of the dishwasher. These noises occur when the motor's internal gears strip or the motor struggles to rotate. Sometimes, the motor may hum but not turn the diverter valve. This means it is receiving power but cannot perform its function. Pay attention to the specific timing of these noises. They often happen when the dishwasher changes spray zones.

Your LG dishwasher might also display error codes. While not all error codes relate to the diverter motor, some can indicate a motor control issue. Check your LG dishwasher's user manual for specific codes. If your dishwasher cycle seems normal but dishes come out dirty, the diverter motor is a likely culprit. Before concluding it is the diverter motor, check for clogged spray arms. Remove the spray arms and clean any food debris from the nozzles. If spray arms are clear and dishes are still dirty, consider the diverter motor. These specific signs help you pinpoint the problem correctly.

## Essential Tools and Parts for LG Dishwasher Diverter Motor Replacement

Before you begin replacing your LG dishwasher diverter motor, gather all necessary tools and parts. Having everything ready saves you time. It also prevents mid-repair trips to the store. Safety is the most important consideration. You will work with electrical components and water lines. Always ensure you have the right gear to protect yourself.

First, you need basic hand tools. A set of screwdrivers is essential. You will need Phillips and flat-head types. Pliers, especially needle-nose pliers, help with hose clamps and electrical connectors. A nut driver or a socket set can be useful for removing bolts. Some models might use Torx screws, so a set of Torx bits is also helpful. You might also need a small bucket or towels to catch any residual water. A flashlight or headlamp improves visibility in tight spaces under the dishwasher.

Next, you need the correct replacement part. Make sure you purchase an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) LG dishwasher diverter motor. Using a genuine LG part ensures compatibility and proper function. Have your dishwasher's model number ready when buying the part. This ensures you get the exact match. Sometimes, new gaskets or O-rings come with the motor. If not, buy them separately if the old ones show wear. Consider having wire nuts or electrical tape on hand for wiring connections. You might also need a voltage tester or multimeter. This helps confirm power is off before you start. Always prioritize safety first.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Replacing Your LG Dishwasher Diverter Motor

Replacing your LG dishwasher diverter motor is a straightforward process if you follow each step carefully. I will walk you through it. Remember, safety comes first. Always disconnect power and water.

### Disconnect Power and Water Supply

First, unplug your LG dishwasher from the electrical outlet. If the power cord is hardwired, flip the circuit breaker off for the dishwasher circuit. This prevents electrical shock. Next, turn off the water supply valve to the dishwasher. This valve is usually under the sink. Have towels ready to catch any drips. Disconnect the water inlet hose from the water supply valve. Disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain or garbage disposal connection.

### Prepare the Dishwasher

Carefully pull your dishwasher out from its cabinet. You may need to remove mounting screws holding it to the countertop or side cabinets. These are usually inside the front frame. Slide the dishwasher out slowly. Do not pull on the hoses or power cord. Lay down old towels or a blanket to protect your floor and the dishwasher. Carefully tip the dishwasher onto its back or side. This gives you access to the underside. Some models might require you to remove the front access panel first.

### Locate and Access the Diverter Motor

Once the dishwasher is on its back, look for the diverter motor. It is usually near the main circulation pump. The diverter motor looks like a small cylinder with electrical wires connected to it. It often has a large plastic housing or manifold connected to it. The wash pump motor is usually larger and more central. If you need to access the main wash pump motor on an LG dishwasher, the access method is similar. [Replacing an LG dishwasher pump motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-dishwasher-pump-motor) involves similar initial steps to expose the underside. The diverter motor is distinct but nearby.

### Disconnect Wiring and Hoses

Take a picture of the wiring connections before you disconnect anything. This helps you reassemble correctly. Disconnect the electrical connector from the diverter motor. Some connectors have a small tab you must press. Next, you need to remove the diverter motor from its housing or manifold. This varies by model. Some motors twist and lock into place. Others use screws or clamps. You might need to release a spring clip or twist the motor about a quarter turn counter-clockwise. Be gentle with plastic components. They can break easily. You might also need to disconnect a small hose or two connected to the diverter assembly.

### Remove the Old Diverter Motor

Once wiring and any hoses are clear, carefully remove the old diverter motor. It might be snug. Do not force it. If it is twisted in, continue twisting until it releases. Check for any O-rings or gaskets that may have come off with the old motor. You will replace these with new ones or ensure they are clean and intact. Compare the old motor to the new one. Ensure they are identical in size and connection points. This confirms you have the correct replacement part.

### Install the New Diverter Motor

Place the new LG dishwasher diverter motor into the housing. Make sure any new gaskets or O-rings are in place. These prevent leaks. Align the motor correctly. It will only fit one way. If it twists in, turn it clockwise until it locks securely. If it uses screws, tighten them evenly. Reconnect any small hoses you removed earlier. They should fit snugly. Reattach the electrical connector to the new motor. Ensure it clicks into place. Double-check all connections. Make sure they are secure.

### Reassemble and Test

Carefully return the dishwasher to its upright position. Slide it back into the cabinet opening. Reconnect the drain hose to the sink and the water supply line to the water valve. Turn on the water supply. Check for any leaks around the water inlet hose connection. Plug the dishwasher back into the electrical outlet or turn on the circuit breaker. Run a short test cycle. Watch for any leaks, especially under the dishwasher. Listen for unusual noises. Check if water sprays correctly from both upper and lower arms.

Your dishes should now come out clean and sparkling.

## Testing and Post-Replacement Tips for Your LG Dishwasher

After you replace the LG dishwasher diverter motor, testing is very important. This step confirms that your repair was successful. It also ensures there are no new problems, like leaks. I always recommend running a test cycle immediately. Start a short wash cycle, perhaps a rinse-only cycle. This uses water but no detergent.

During the test cycle, carefully watch and listen. Look for any signs of water leaks under the dishwasher. Pay close attention to the area around the new diverter motor and hose connections. A small drip can become a big problem. Feel around the connections with a dry paper towel to detect any moisture. Listen for the sound of the diverter motor. It should operate smoothly and quietly. You should hear the water flow switching between the spray arms.

Once the test cycle finishes, open the dishwasher door. Check the interior for any signs of standing water that should not be there. Also, observe the spray arms. They should spin freely. If possible, run a full wash cycle with a small load of dishes. This allows you to verify the cleaning performance. Check if dishes on both the upper and lower racks come out clean. This confirms the diverter motor is directing water properly. A successful test means your repair is complete.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues After LG Dishwasher Diverter Motor Replacement

Sometimes, issues can arise even after replacing your LG dishwasher diverter motor. Do not worry. Many problems have simple solutions. I can help you troubleshoot. The most common issue is still having dirty dishes. If your dishes are still not clean, especially on one rack, recheck the diverter motor. Ensure it is fully seated and connected. The diverter motor might not be getting power. Use a multimeter to test for voltage at the motor's connector while the dishwasher is trying to run.

Another problem can be leaks. If you see water leaking, it is usually from a loose connection. Check all hose clamps and threaded connections. The diverter motor might have a new gasket or O-ring that did not seal correctly. Turn off power and water. Then, re-seat the motor or tighten the connections. Always ensure any new gaskets are properly aligned and not pinched. A simple loose clamp can cause significant water damage.

The dishwasher might also not start or display an error code. First, ensure the dishwasher is fully plugged in or the breaker is on. Check if the door latches properly. Some dishwashers will not run if the door sensor thinks it is open. Review your wiring connections to the new motor. Loose wires can prevent the motor from receiving power. If you have other LG dishwasher parts that might be failing, such as the door gasket, this could also cause leaks. A guide on [how to replace an LG dishwasher door gasket](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-dishwasher-door-gasket) covers a different leak source, but the principle of checking seals applies. These troubleshooting steps help you confirm your repair or identify other issues.

## Maintenance Tips to Extend Your LG Dishwasher's Lifespan

Maintaining your LG dishwasher helps extend its life. Regular care prevents common problems, including those affecting the diverter motor. I always suggest simple habits that make a big difference. These habits keep your dishwasher working well.

First, regularly clean the dishwasher filter. Most LG dishwashers have a filter at the bottom. Food particles and debris collect here. A clogged filter restricts water flow and puts strain on the pump and diverter motor. Clean it weekly or bi-weekly, depending on use. Remove the filter, rinse it under running water, and use a soft brush if needed. This simple step prevents many issues.

Second, avoid overloading your dishwasher. Overloading blocks spray arms. This prevents water from reaching all dishes. It also forces the diverter motor and pump to work harder. Proper loading allows water to circulate freely. Leave space between items. Make sure tall items do not block the upper spray arm. For general LG dishwasher care, even knowing [how to replace an LG dishwasher drain hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-dishwasher-drain-hose) is useful. It ensures good drainage, which is part of overall system health.

Third, use the right amount of detergent. Too much detergent can cause excessive suds. This leaves residue on dishes and inside the dishwasher. Too little detergent might not clean effectively. Always use a high-quality dishwasher detergent. Consider using a rinse aid. Rinse aid helps water sheet off dishes. This prevents spots and improves drying. This also prevents mineral buildup inside the dishwasher, which can affect motor performance. These simple maintenance tasks keep your LG dishwasher running efficiently for years.
