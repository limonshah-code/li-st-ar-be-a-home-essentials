## Easily Find Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model Number

Do you own a Kenmore refrigerator? You probably know how central it is to your home. When it needs a part or a repair, the first thing you need is its model number. Finding this specific identifier can feel like a small scavenger hunt. But knowing exactly where to look saves you time and frustration.

This guide helps you quickly find your Kenmore refrigerator model number. We show you the most common places to check. We also explain why this number is so important for maintenance and service. By the end, you will know exactly how to locate this crucial piece of information. This helps you keep your Kenmore appliance running smoothly for years to come.

### Takeaway

*   Check inside the refrigerator, on the walls, ceilings, or door frames.
*   Look behind the kickplate at the bottom front of the appliance.
*   The back panel of the refrigerator may also hold the label.
*   Record both the model and serial numbers for future use.

The Kenmore refrigerator model number is a unique code. It tells you the exact type and specifications of your appliance. You typically find this number on a label or sticker. These labels are often inside the refrigerator compartment or on the back. This number is essential for ordering parts, scheduling repairs, and checking warranty information.

## Why Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model Number Matters

Having your Kenmore refrigerator model number is more important than you might think. It is the specific identifier for your appliance. This number helps you get the correct information and parts. Without it, finding the right replacement part or getting accurate repair advice becomes very difficult.

When you call for service, the technician needs this number. It tells them what components your refrigerator uses. This helps them bring the correct tools and parts for the job. You avoid delays and extra service calls this way. Knowing the model number makes the repair process efficient.

You also need the model number for warranty claims. If your Kenmore refrigerator has a problem, the warranty covers certain repairs. But you must provide the model number to confirm coverage. It proves that your appliance is indeed under warranty. This ensures you get the service you deserve.

Finally, the model number helps you research your appliance online. You can find user manuals, troubleshooting guides, and product specifications. This information empowers you to handle minor issues yourself. It also helps you understand your refrigerator's features better.

## Common Places to Find Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model Number

Finding your Kenmore refrigerator model number often involves looking in a few key areas. Manufacturers place these labels in spots that are usually out of sight but accessible. These locations ensure the label does not get damaged easily. They also keep the refrigerator's appearance clean.

Most Kenmore refrigerators have the model number label inside the fresh food compartment. You might find it on the side wall, near the top, or on the ceiling. Sometimes, it is on the frame around the door opening. I always check these spots first when I need this information. It is usually a small sticker, often white or silver, with black text.

Another common place is behind the kickplate. This is the removable panel at the very bottom front of your refrigerator. You usually need to gently pull it off or remove a couple of screws to access it. The label might be stuck to the frame behind the kickplate. This spot protects the label from spills or daily wear and tear.

Some Kenmore refrigerator models have the label on the back panel of the appliance. This location is less convenient. You often need to pull the refrigerator away from the wall to see it. Before you move it, make sure to unplug the unit for safety. Always be careful when moving large appliances to avoid damage or injury. This location is common for older models or specific built-in units. Just like when you need to find the [GE refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-ge-refrigerator-model-number) or the [Samsung refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-samsung-refrigerator-model-number), checking these standard spots first is always a good idea.

### Inside the Fresh Food Compartment

Check the inner walls of the refrigerator section. The label can be on the left or right side. Sometimes, it is on the top ceiling area. This label often lists both the model and serial numbers.

*   **Near the top hinge:** Open the main refrigerator door. Look closely at the frame where the door closes. The sticker may be on the top part of the frame.
*   **On the side wall:** Scan the interior side walls. The label might be a small white or silver sticker. It is usually printed with black numbers and letters.
*   **On the ceiling:** Some models have the label on the ceiling of the refrigerator. You might need a flashlight to see it clearly, especially if it is dark inside.

### Behind the Kickplate

The kickplate is the panel at the bottom front of your Kenmore refrigerator. It is designed to cover the components underneath. This location keeps the label protected.

1.  **Locate the kickplate:** It runs along the bottom edge of the refrigerator.
2.  **Remove the kickplate:** Most kickplates pull straight off. Some might have two screws you need to remove. Store the screws in a safe place.
3.  **Find the label:** Look on the frame or floor underneath the refrigerator. The label is often affixed to a metal crossbar or support.

### On the Back of the Refrigerator

The back of the refrigerator is another possible spot. This location is less common for newer models. However, it is worth checking if you cannot find the label elsewhere.

*   **Pull the refrigerator out:** Carefully slide the refrigerator away from the wall. Make sure to unplug it first.
*   **Inspect the back panel:** Look for a large sticker on the upper or lower part of the back. It may be near the compressor or condenser coils.
*   **Use a flashlight:** The area can be dusty or dark. A flashlight helps you see the label clearly.

## How to Read Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model Number Tag

Once you find the tag, reading the Kenmore refrigerator model number is straightforward. The tag usually contains several pieces of information. The model number is typically clearly labeled. It often says "Model No." or "M/N" next to it. The serial number is also present, usually labeled "Serial No." or "S/N".

The model number consists of a series of letters and numbers. For Kenmore appliances, these numbers often start with a three-digit prefix. This prefix indicates the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that built the appliance for Kenmore. For example, a model number starting with "253" indicates it was made by Frigidaire. A "795" prefix means LG made it. This is similar to how you would identify components for a [Whirlpool refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-your-whirlpool-refrigerator-model-number) or a [KitchenAid refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-kitchenaid-refrigerator-model-number), where the numbers tell a specific story about the appliance's origin and specifications.

The rest of the model number details the specific features and design. It identifies the color, capacity, and other unique characteristics. Sometimes, there is a revision number or version listed too. This helps distinguish between similar models made in different production runs. Write down the entire model number exactly as it appears. Any small mistake can lead to ordering the wrong parts.

The serial number is different from the model number. It is a unique identifier for that specific unit. No two appliances have the same serial number. This number is used for warranty tracking and product recalls. Always record both the model and serial numbers. This ensures you have complete information for any future needs. Keeping a photo of the tag on your phone is a smart idea.

## What If You Can't Find The Model Number?

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the Kenmore refrigerator model number label is missing or unreadable. This can happen if the label fades over time, gets peeled off, or is covered. Do not worry; there are still steps you can take to find the information you need. I have faced this problem myself, and it requires a bit more detective work.

First, check any documentation you might have. Did you keep the original user manual? Many manuals include a dedicated section for recording the model and serial numbers. The purchase receipt or warranty card also often lists this information. If you registered your appliance online, check your account on the retailer's or Kenmore's website. They might have a record of your purchase with the model details. This is often the quickest solution if you kept your paperwork.

If paperwork does not help, look for online resources. Sometimes, a model number can be partially identified by its appearance or features. Search for "Kenmore refrigerator types" or "Kenmore refrigerator styles." Compare images of similar models to yours. While this might not give you the exact model number, it can narrow down the possibilities. This might help a service technician get a starting point.

Finally, contact Kenmore customer service. Provide them with as much detail as you can. Tell them the approximate age of your refrigerator, its color, and any unique features. If you remember where you bought it, that information helps too. They might be able to find your appliance in their database using your purchase date or your address. They can also tell you common model number locations for your specific refrigerator type. This is similar to calling support for a [Frigidaire refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-frigidaire-refrigerator-model-number) or a [Maytag refrigerator model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-maytag-refrigerator-model-number), where customer service often serves as a last resort.

## Using Your Kenmore Model Number for Parts and Service

Once you have your Kenmore refrigerator model number, you can use it to get the right parts and service. This number is your key to accessing accurate information. It ensures compatibility and avoids costly mistakes. When ordering a new water filter, a door handle, or a specific circuit board, the model number is essential.

Online parts retailers and appliance repair shops use model numbers to look up diagrams and part lists. You simply enter your model number into their search bar. The system then displays all compatible parts for your specific Kenmore refrigerator. This makes finding the correct component easy. It prevents you from buying a part that does not fit or work.

When you call a repair technician, give them the model number upfront. This allows them to prepare before their visit. They can look up common issues for your specific model. They might even bring necessary parts with them. This saves time and means your refrigerator gets fixed faster. Imagine if they arrived without the right part; it would cause delays and frustration.

The model number also helps with general maintenance. You can find specific cleaning instructions or troubleshooting tips for your Kenmore refrigerator model. This empowers you to perform minor maintenance tasks yourself. It also helps you identify if a problem is a common issue or something unique to your unit. Having this information helps you make informed decisions about your appliance's care.

## Understanding Kenmore Refrigerator Serial Numbers

Beyond the Kenmore refrigerator model number, there is also a serial number. This number is equally important, but it serves a different purpose. While the model number tells you what *type* of refrigerator you have, the serial number identifies your *specific unit*. Think of it like a car's VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).

Every Kenmore refrigerator produced has a unique serial number. No two refrigerators, even if they are the exact same model, will share the same serial number. This uniqueness makes the serial number vital for tracking and record-keeping. It ties your particular appliance to its manufacturing date and location.

The serial number is used for several key functions. It helps with warranty claims. When you register your appliance or need a repair, the serial number confirms its purchase date and warranty status. It also assists in product recalls. If Kenmore or the original manufacturer issues a recall for a certain batch of refrigerators, the serial number helps identify affected units.

Additionally, the serial number can sometimes reveal the manufacturing date of your Kenmore refrigerator. Different manufacturers encode this information in various ways within the serial number itself. Some use the first few digits or letters to indicate the year and week of production. This information can be useful for determining the age of your appliance. It also helps estimate its remaining lifespan. Always record both the model number and the serial number when you find them. This complete record will save you trouble later.

## Tips for Maintaining Your Kenmore Refrigerator

Knowing how to find your Kenmore refrigerator model number is a great first step. But proper maintenance keeps your appliance running efficiently for years. Regular care extends its lifespan and prevents costly repairs. I always advise people to be proactive with their appliances.

*   **Clean the Condenser Coils:** The condenser coils are usually on the back or underneath your refrigerator. Dust and pet hair can build up on them. This buildup makes the refrigerator work harder. Clean them at least once a year. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to gently remove debris.
*   **Check Door Gaskets:** The rubber seals around the refrigerator and freezer doors are important. They keep cold air in and warm air out. Check them regularly for cracks or tears. You can test them by closing the door on a dollar bill. If the bill pulls out easily, the seal might be weak. Clean the gaskets with mild soap and water.
*   **Keep Vents Clear:** Inside your refrigerator, there are vents that help circulate cold air. Make sure nothing blocks these vents. Proper airflow ensures even cooling throughout the compartments. Do not overfill your refrigerator, as this can block airflow.
*   **Monitor Temperature:** Use a refrigerator thermometer to check the internal temperature. The refrigerator should be between 35-38°F (1.7-3.3°C). The freezer should be at 0°F (-18°C). Correct temperatures keep food fresh and safe. Adjust settings if needed.
*   **Replace Water Filter:** If your Kenmore refrigerator has an ice maker or water dispenser, replace the water filter regularly. Most manufacturers recommend replacement every six months. The model number helps you find the correct filter. This ensures clean water and ice. This is similar to needing the specific model number to replace parts on other appliances like finding the [LG dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-lg-dishwasher-model-number) for its filter or the [Samsung dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-samsung-dishwasher-model-number).
*   **Defrost Freezer (Non-Frost-Free Models):** If you have an older Kenmore refrigerator without an automatic defrost feature, manually defrost it when ice builds up to about a quarter-inch thick. Excess ice reduces efficiency and storage space.

These simple maintenance tasks make a big difference. They help your Kenmore refrigerator run smoothly. They also help you avoid unexpected breakdowns.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Kenmore Refrigerator Model Numbers

### Q1: Can I find the model number on my Kenmore refrigerator's receipt?

Yes, many retailers include the full model number on the purchase receipt. Check your original sales receipt or invoice. This is often the easiest way to find it if the physical label is hard to locate or read. It saves you from searching inside or behind the appliance.

### Q2: Is the Kenmore refrigerator model number the same as the serial number?

No, the model number and serial number are different. The model number identifies the specific type or series of your refrigerator. The serial number identifies your unique unit, much like a car's VIN. You need both for different purposes, like parts ordering and warranty claims.

### Q3: Why is my Kenmore model number starting with three digits like "253" or "795"?

The first three digits of a Kenmore model number indicate the original manufacturer. Kenmore is a brand, not a manufacturer. For example, "253" often means the refrigerator was made by Frigidaire. "795" means LG manufactured it. This helps identify the original parts source.

### Q4: What should I do if the model number label is worn off?

If the label is worn off, first check your owner's manual or purchase receipt. If those are unavailable, look for any online records from where you bought the refrigerator. As a last resort, contact Kenmore customer service. Provide them with details like the age and features of your appliance.

### Q5: Can I find parts for my Kenmore refrigerator using only the serial number?

While the serial number is important for warranty and manufacturing details, parts are typically ordered using the model number. The model number tells parts suppliers exactly which components are compatible. The serial number helps confirm the correct model within a specific production range.

### Q6: How often should I check my Kenmore refrigerator's model number?

You do not need to check it frequently. Find it once and record it in a safe place. A good practice is to take a photo of the label with your smartphone. Store this photo in a dedicated folder. This way, you have it instantly available whenever you need it for parts or service.
