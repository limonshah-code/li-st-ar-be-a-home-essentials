## Master How to Clean Your LG HE Washing Machine

You use your washing machine constantly. It works hard to keep your clothes fresh. However, your LG HE washing machine itself needs regular cleaning. Dirt, detergent residue, and moisture can build up inside. This leads to unpleasant odors and reduced cleaning performance.

Proper cleaning ensures your washer runs efficiently. It also keeps your clothes truly clean. This guide will show you how to clean your LG HE washing machine thoroughly. We cover every important part of your appliance. I will provide simple, clear steps. You can make sure your washer stays in top condition.

### Takeaway

Keeping your LG HE washing machine clean is simple. Follow these steps:

*   Run a dedicated Tub Clean cycle regularly.
*   Wipe down the rubber gasket after each use.
*   Clean out the detergent dispenser drawers often.
*   Empty and rinse the drain pump filter every few months.
*   Leave the washer door ajar to allow air circulation.

To clean your LG HE washing machine, run its Tub Clean cycle with a washing machine cleaner, white vinegar, or bleach. Manually clean the rubber gasket around the door, the detergent dispenser, and the drain pump filter. This routine prevents odors and ensures your high-efficiency machine cleans clothes effectively.

## Understanding Your LG HE Washing Machine

Your LG HE washing machine is a modern appliance. The "HE" stands for High-Efficiency. These machines use less water and energy than older models. They often do not have an agitator. Instead, they use tumbling action or a wash plate to clean clothes.

This design makes HE washers very efficient. However, it also creates unique cleaning needs. Less water means detergents are more concentrated. Residue can build up quickly. The damp environment inside, especially in front-load models, can also lead to mold and mildew. This is why regular cleaning is very important for LG HE washing machines. Neglecting this task can cause odors. It can also make your clothes smell less fresh.

LG HE washers, particularly front-loaders, are prone to mold. Water often pools in the door gasket. This creates a breeding ground for mildew. Soap scum also contributes to residue inside the drum. I make sure to clean my LG washer regularly. This helps prevent these issues from starting. A clean machine performs better. It also lasts longer. Keeping your LG HE washing machine spotless is a key part of home maintenance.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Your LG HE Washer

You need a few basic items to clean your LG HE washing machine properly. Gathering your supplies before you start saves time. It makes the cleaning process smoother. You probably have most of these items already at home.

First, you need a good cleaning agent for the drum. Commercial washing machine cleaners are available. Brands like affresh or Tide Washing Machine Cleaner work well. These are designed specifically for this job. Alternatively, common household items can also be effective. White vinegar and bleach are popular choices. Each has its own benefits.

Second, you will need tools for manual cleaning. A few microfiber cloths are good for wiping surfaces. An old toothbrush or a small scrub brush helps reach tight spots. A small basin or towel is useful for catching water. This is especially true when cleaning the drain pump filter. Wearing rubber gloves protects your hands from cleaning solutions. These simple tools will help you reach every part of your washer. They ensure a thorough clean.

### Choosing Your Cleaning Agent

*   **Commercial Washing Machine Cleaners:**
    *   These products come as tablets or liquids.
    *   They are designed to break down detergent residue and odors.
    *   They are safe for your machine's components.
    *   Follow the package directions for best results.
*   **White Vinegar:**
    *   Vinegar is a natural disinfectant.
    *   It helps remove mineral deposits and mildew.
    *   Use distilled white vinegar. Do not use apple cider vinegar.
    *   It is a good option if you prefer natural products. You can learn more about [how to clean a washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-vinegar) for detailed steps.
*   **Bleach:**
    *   Bleach is a powerful disinfectant.
    *   It kills mold and mildew effectively.
    *   Use regular liquid chlorine bleach. Do not use color-safe bleach.
    *   Bleach is strong. It should be used carefully. For thorough instructions, see our guide on [how to clean a washing machine with bleach](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-bleach).

Never mix bleach and vinegar. This combination creates toxic chlorine gas. It is very dangerous. Choose one cleaning agent for the drum cycle. Use it according to the instructions.

## Deep Cleaning the Washer Drum

The washer drum is where your clothes get clean. It also accumulates soap scum and odors over time. Deep cleaning the drum is essential. This step helps refresh your LG HE washing machine. It removes any hidden grime.

Most LG HE washing machines have a "Tub Clean" or "Sanitize" cycle. This cycle is designed for cleaning the machine itself. It uses higher water temperatures. It also runs for a longer duration. Check your owner's manual for specific instructions on how to start this cycle. Before starting, make sure the drum is empty. There should be no clothes inside.

You can use a commercial cleaner or a DIY solution. If using a commercial cleaner, place the tablet or liquid directly into the drum. Then, start the Tub Clean cycle. If using white vinegar, pour two cups into the detergent dispenser. For bleach, add half a cup to the bleach dispenser. Then, run the cycle. This process flushes out buildup. It leaves the drum smelling fresh.

### Steps for Drum Cleaning

1.  **Empty the Washer:** Remove all clothes and items from the drum.
2.  **Add Cleaner:**
    *   **Commercial Cleaner:** Place 1-2 tablets or the recommended amount of liquid directly into the washer drum.
    *   **White Vinegar:** Pour 2 cups of distilled white vinegar into the liquid detergent dispenser.
    *   **Bleach:** Add 1/2 cup of liquid chlorine bleach to the bleach dispenser compartment.
3.  **Select Tub Clean Cycle:** Look for "Tub Clean," "Sanitize," or "Clean Washer" on your LG HE washing machine's control panel. If your model does not have a dedicated cycle, choose the hottest water setting. Select the longest wash cycle.
4.  **Start the Cycle:** Close the washer door. Press the "Start" button. Let the cycle run completely.
5.  **Wipe Down After:** Once the cycle finishes, open the door. Use a clean cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum. This removes any loosened residue. Pay attention to any remaining dampness.

Running this cycle monthly is a good practice. It prevents stubborn buildup. It also keeps your washer smelling good. A clean drum ensures your clothes come out fresh every time. Maintaining a clean drum is fundamental. It improves your washing machine's performance.

## Tackling the LG HE Washer Gasket and Door

The rubber gasket, or boot, around your LG HE washing machine's door is a critical area. It creates a seal to prevent water leaks. However, this damp, dark space often collects water, lint, and detergent residue. This combination is perfect for mold and mildew growth. Mold is a common source of musty odors in front-load washers.

Cleaning the gasket regularly is very important. I check mine after every few washes. Mold can appear as black spots. It can also feel slimy. Ignoring it will make the problem worse. It can spread to your clothes.

The door itself also needs attention. Wipe the glass and the plastic rim. Food particles or pet hair can cling to these surfaces. A clean door ensures a tight seal. It also keeps your laundry area looking neat. Taking these extra steps greatly helps keep your LG HE washing machine fresh. Our article on [how to clean mold from a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing-machine) offers more specific guidance if you have a significant mold issue.

### How to Clean the Gasket and Door

1.  **Prepare the Area:** Open the washer door wide. Pull back the rubber gasket to expose the hidden crevices. Use a flashlight if needed.
2.  **Initial Wipe:** Use a damp microfiber cloth to wipe away loose debris. Remove any hair, lint, or small objects.
3.  **Apply Cleaner:**
    *   **Mildew Cleaner:** Spray a dedicated mildew cleaner onto the gasket.
    *   **Bleach Solution:** Mix 1/4 cup of bleach with 1 gallon of water. Dip a cloth in the solution.
    *   **Vinegar Solution:** Use undiluted white vinegar on a cloth.
    *   Apply your chosen cleaner generously to all visible mold and residue. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes.
4.  **Scrub Thoroughly:** Use a small brush (like an old toothbrush) or the corner of a cloth to scrub the gasket. Pay extra attention to folds and grooves. These areas trap the most grime.
5.  **Rinse and Dry:** Wipe the gasket clean with a fresh, damp cloth. Make sure all cleaning solution is removed. Then, dry the gasket thoroughly with a clean, dry cloth. Drying is key to preventing new mold growth.
6.  **Clean the Door:** Wipe down the inside and outside of the washer door. Clean the glass and the surrounding plastic. Use an all-purpose cleaner or glass cleaner for this part.
7.  **Leave Door Ajar:** After cleaning, leave the washer door slightly open. This allows air to circulate. It helps the gasket dry completely. This simple step prevents moisture buildup. It stops mold from returning.

Cleaning the gasket should be a weekly task for best results. This ensures your LG HE washing machine stays odor-free. It also protects your clothes from mold transfer.

## Cleaning the Dispenser Drawers and Detergent Compartments

The dispenser drawers in your LG HE washing machine hold detergent, fabric softener, and bleach. Over time, these compartments can accumulate sticky residue. This residue is often a mixture of undissolved detergent and fabric softener. This sticky buildup is sometimes called "scrud." It can block the dispensers. It also becomes a breeding ground for mold and bacteria.

When dispensers are clogged, your cleaning products do not dispense properly. This means your clothes might not get as clean as they should. You might notice soap streaks on your laundry. Or, your fabric softener might not dispense at all. Regularly cleaning these drawers ensures proper product delivery. It also prevents unpleasant odors from the washer.

I once found a thick, black gunk in my softener dispenser. It smelled terrible. Now, I always make sure to clean these drawers. It is a simple step that makes a big difference. This maintenance step keeps your LG HE washing machine working correctly. It also ensures your clothes are truly clean. Addressing detergent residue prevents many common washer problems. For more information on removing persistent residue, consult our article on [how to clean scrud from a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-scrud-from-a-washing-machine).

### Steps for Cleaning Dispensers

1.  **Remove the Drawer:** Most LG HE washing machines have removable dispenser drawers. Look for a release button or tab. It is often located inside the compartment or at the back. Pull the drawer out completely.
2.  **Disassemble Compartments:** Separate any removable inserts or dividers within the drawer. These usually lift right out.
3.  **Rinse Under Hot Water:** Take the drawer and inserts to a sink. Rinse them under hot running water. This helps dissolve loose residue.
4.  **Scrub Away Buildup:**
    *   Use an old toothbrush or small brush.
    *   Apply a mild dish soap or a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water.
    *   Scrub all surfaces of the drawer and its compartments. Pay special attention to corners and dispensing holes.
    *   For stubborn residue, you can soak the parts in hot, soapy water for 30 minutes before scrubbing.
5.  **Clean the Dispenser Housing:** While the drawer is out, look into the cavity where it sits. You will often see residue built up inside. Use a damp cloth or a brush to clean this area. Reach into the crevices as much as you can. A spray bottle with vinegar solution can help loosen grime here.
6.  **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse all drawer components thoroughly under clean water. Ensure no soap or cleaner remains. Dry them completely with a clean cloth.
7.  **Reassemble and Replace:** Put the inserts back into the drawer. Slide the clean drawer back into its slot in the washing machine. Ensure it clicks into place securely.

Clean these dispenser drawers at least once a month. If you use liquid detergents or fabric softener frequently, clean them more often. This prevents clogs and ensures your products dispense correctly. It also helps your LG HE washing machine maintain its freshness. For specific tips on cleaning the softener dispenser, see our guide
