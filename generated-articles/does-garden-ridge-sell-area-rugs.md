## The Evolution of Garden Ridge: From Decor to At Home Area Rugs

Many people recall Garden Ridge as a familiar name in home improvement and decor. It was a place where you could find seasonal items, garden supplies, and home furnishings. Over time, the company recognized a clear need to focus its identity. This led to a significant rebranding effort. In 2014, Garden Ridge officially transformed into At Home. This change marked a new chapter for the company.

The transformation was more than just a name change. It signaled a sharpened focus on home decor items. At Home became "The Home Decor Superstore." This new identity emphasized their commitment to providing a vast array of home furnishings. This includes a wide selection of floor coverings. The companyâ€™s goal became simple: offer everything you need to decorate your home under one roof. They wanted to make home decorating accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

The change directly impacted their area rug selection. At Home expanded its inventory significantly. They introduced more styles, sizes, and materials to meet diverse customer preferences. This ensured that whether you sought a modern geometric design or a classic Persian pattern, you could find it. This commitment to variety made At Home a premier destination for area rugs. They built upon the foundation Garden Ridge laid. The new brand focused on delivering value and choice. They made sure customers found the perfect rug for their living spaces.

Today, At Home carries the torch. They offer an impressive collection of area rugs. The brand continues to prioritize a broad selection. They focus on affordability and current trends. This commitment helps customers create inviting and stylish homes. The transition from Garden Ridge to At Home means a dedicated resource for all your home decor needs.

## Exploring At Home's Vast Selection of Area Rugs

At Home positions itself as a premier destination for home furnishings. Its selection of area rugs is truly extensive. You can find almost any style to match your existing decor or inspire a new look. They organize rugs by style, making your search easier. For example, modern designs feature clean lines and abstract patterns. Traditional rugs often showcase classic motifs and rich colors. Bohemian styles offer vibrant patterns and textures. Transitional rugs blend old and new elements. Farmhouse rugs provide a cozy, rustic feel. This variety ensures every shopper finds something to love.

The range of materials is also impressive. Wool rugs offer natural durability and a soft feel. Synthetic options, like polypropylene and nylon, provide stain resistance and easy care. Jute and sisal rugs bring natural textures and an organic look. Cotton rugs are soft and washable, perfect for casual spaces. Blended materials combine the best features of different fibers. Each material offers unique benefits for different room types and lifestyles. Considering the material helps you choose a rug that meets your practical needs.

At Home understands that size matters when selecting an area rug. They stock a wide array of dimensions. Small accent rugs, like 2x3 or 3x5, work well in entryways or small nooks. Medium-sized rugs, such as 5x7 or 6x9, are ideal for defining seating areas in living rooms. Large area rugs, including 8x10, 9x12, or even larger, can fill an entire room. They also offer runners for hallways and round rugs for specific focal points. Proper sizing ensures your rug enhances the room's proportions. It helps create a cohesive design.

This vast selection ensures you can cover any floor space with beauty and function.

## Finding Quality and Value in At Home's Floor Coverings

When you buy an area rug, you want both quality and good value. At Home excels at offering both. They provide a wide selection of rugs that fit various budgets without compromising too much on durability. It is important to know how to assess a rug's quality. When you shop in person, take time to examine the rug closely. Feel the pile; a denser pile generally indicates better quality and durability. Look at the backing material. A sturdy, well-made backing helps the rug lie flat and prevents slipping. Check the construction method, whether machine-made or hand-tufted. These details contribute to the rug's overall lifespan and performance.

At Home understands the importance of competitive pricing. They offer rugs at price points accessible to almost everyone. You can find budget-friendly synthetic options perfect for high-traffic areas. You can also discover higher-end wool rugs that add luxury to your living room. The brand often runs sales and promotions. These events provide excellent opportunities to purchase a high-quality rug at an even lower price. Always check their weekly ads or website for current deals. Exploring clearance sections can also reveal hidden gems. These rugs may be discontinued styles or overstock items. They offer significant savings without sacrificing quality.

Investing in a good area rug means it will last for years. Proper care also extends its life. Knowing how to maintain your rug helps preserve its beauty and value. For example, regular vacuuming and prompt spot cleaning are crucial. These simple steps keep your rug looking fresh. Learning [how to clean area rugs inside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-area-rugs-inside) will protect your investment. At Home provides options that balance aesthetics with longevity. This helps you make a smart purchase for your home. They aim to make stylish living affordable and enduring.

## Shopping for Area Rugs: In-Store vs. Online Experience at At Home

Choosing the right area rug involves understanding your shopping preferences. At Home offers two primary ways to browse and buy: in-store and online. Each method has its own benefits. Shopping in a physical At Home store provides a unique experience. You can see the rugs in person. You can touch the textures, feel the pile, and observe the true colors under various lighting conditions. This is important because rug colors can appear different on a screen. Stores often display rugs in large formats. This helps you visualize how they might look in your home. You can also get immediate assistance from staff. They can answer questions and offer styling advice. The main benefit is the tactile experience. You can confirm the rug meets your expectations before purchase.

Online shopping offers unparalleled convenience. At Home's website features an extensive catalog of area rugs. You can filter by style, size, color, material, and price. This makes narrowing down your choices very efficient. Customer reviews and photos provide additional insights from other buyers. You can shop from the comfort of your home at any time. Online purchases are delivered directly to your door. This saves you the effort of transporting a large rug. The downside is you cannot physically interact with the rug. You must rely on images and descriptions. However, At Home provides clear return policies if the rug does not meet your expectations upon arrival. Thinking about how the rug will fit into your space is crucial. For example, considering [Do Area Rugs Go Under Sofa](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-area-rugs-go-under-sofa) can help you decide on the right size and placement before you even buy.

### Maximizing Your In-Store Visit

When you plan to visit an At Home store, come prepared. Measure your room and the area you intend to cover. Bring fabric swatches or paint chips to match colors accurately. Take photos of your furniture and decor for reference. This helps you choose a rug that complements your existing items. Wear comfortable shoes, as At Home stores are large. Do not hesitate to ask staff for help rolling out rugs or finding specific styles. They are there to assist you in making the best choice.

### Navigating At Home's Online Rug Catalog

When shopping online, utilize all the filtering options. Start with size and color to quickly narrow down the thousands of choices. Read product descriptions carefully. Pay attention to material details and care instructions. Look at customer reviews for insights into actual product appearance and durability. Compare several options before making a decision. Keep At Home's return policy in mind. This gives you peace of mind when buying a rug without seeing it first. Both shopping methods offer great ways to find the perfect area rug.

## Tips for Choosing the Right Area Rug for Your Home

Selecting the perfect area rug goes beyond simply picking a design you like. Several factors contribute to a rug's suitability for your home. Consider these points to make an informed decision. First, size and placement are crucial. A rug that is too small can make a room feel disjointed. One that is too large might overwhelm the space. In a living room, the rug should be large enough for at least the front legs of all major furniture pieces to rest on it. For dining rooms, ensure the rug extends far enough so that chairs remain on the rug when pulled out. In bedrooms, it should extend beyond the sides of the bed. Measuring your space accurately before you shop is very important.

Second, consider color and pattern. The rug should complement your existing decor. It does not always need to perfectly match. A rug can introduce a new color accent or tie existing colors together. Patterns can add visual interest. They can define zones in an open-concept living area. For busy rooms, a subtle pattern or solid color might work best. For rooms with neutral furniture, a bold pattern can become a focal point. Think about the overall mood you want to create. Warm colors bring coziness, while cool colors promote tranquility.

Third, material suitability is key for longevity and function. High-traffic areas, such as entryways or living rooms, benefit from durable materials. Synthetic rugs like polypropylene are great for these spots. They resist stains and wear. For pet owners, easy-to-clean materials are a must. Wool rugs offer natural stain resistance and a luxurious feel for lower-traffic areas. Jute and sisal add texture but are less soft. Choose a material that stands up to your lifestyle. Sometimes, people even wonder about putting rugs over existing carpet. You can find helpful advice on [Can You Put Area Rugs Over Carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-area-rugs-over-carpet) if you have carpeted rooms. This helps you consider all options for placement.

Finally, set a realistic budget for your area rug purchase. Rugs vary widely in price based on size, material, and construction. Knowing your budget beforehand helps you narrow down options. At Home offers choices at many price points. You can find excellent value without overspending. Prioritize what is most important to you: durability, aesthetic, or cost. By considering these tips, you will find an area rug that enhances your home's beauty and function for years to come.

### Measuring for Success

Accurate measurements prevent costly mistakes. For living rooms, measure the main seating area. Ensure the rug extends at least 6-12 inches beyond the furniture. For dining rooms, measure your table and add at least 24 inches on all sides. This allows chairs to stay on the rug when pulled out. For bedrooms, consider a rug that covers two-thirds of the floor space or extends under the bed. A tape measure is your best friend when planning your rug purchase.

### Style and Aesthetic Considerations

Your rug is a large decor element. It must harmonize with your home's style. If your home is minimalist, a simple geometric rug might fit. If it is traditional, a classic pattern works well. Use the rug to either blend in seamlessly or create a bold statement. Collect inspiration from magazines or online platforms. This helps you identify patterns and colors you like. A rug ties a room together, acting as an anchor for your design.

## Maintaining Your At Home Area Rugs for Lasting Beauty

Once you find the perfect area rug from At Home, proper maintenance ensures its beauty lasts. Regular cleaning prevents dirt and debris from damaging the fibers. Basic cleaning starts with frequent vacuuming. Vacuum your rug at least once a week, more often in high-traffic areas. Use a vacuum with adjustable height settings to avoid damaging the rug pile. For fringed rugs, use the upholstery attachment to avoid tangling the fringe. This simple step removes loose dirt before it grinds into the fibers.

Spot cleaning is also very important for spills and accidents. Act quickly to prevent stains from setting. Blot the spill with a clean white cloth or paper towel. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain and push it deeper into the fibers. Use a mild rug cleaner or a solution of mild soap and water. Test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not discolor the rug. Specific cleaning instructions may vary by rug material. Always check the manufacturer's care label for best practices.

Protecting your investment involves more than just cleaning. Rug pads are essential accessories. They provide cushioning, prevent slipping, and protect your rug from wear and tear. A good rug pad also protects your flooring underneath. Rotate your rug every 6-12 months. This ensures even wear and prevents one area from fading more than others due to sunlight. Avoid placing rugs in direct, prolonged sunlight. UV rays can cause colors to fade over time.

You may face common rug issues over time. Shedding is normal for new wool rugs and usually decreases with vacuuming. Fading, if not managed with rotation, can be permanent. For deep cleaning or stubborn stains, consider professional cleaning services. Professionals have specialized equipment and knowledge. They can safely clean different rug materials. Sometimes, people look for ways to handle these tasks themselves. Knowing [how to self-clean area rugs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-self-clean-area-rugs) can save you money. It also gives you control over the cleaning process. Proper care and proactive measures help your At Home area rug remain a beautiful part of your home for many years.
