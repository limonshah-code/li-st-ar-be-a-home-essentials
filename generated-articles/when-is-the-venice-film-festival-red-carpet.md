While the red carpet is accessible to the public, gaining entry to screenings or special events requires accreditation or tickets. These are often reserved for industry professionals or sold out far in advance. Your goal as a public viewer is usually to see the arrivals. Knowing how to position yourself for the best viewing, or even how to [gain access to exclusive areas](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-onto-the-red-carpet), helps improve your festival experience. Dress comfortably for the wait, but remember you are at a glamorous event. You might want to look presentable for any chance encounters or photos.
