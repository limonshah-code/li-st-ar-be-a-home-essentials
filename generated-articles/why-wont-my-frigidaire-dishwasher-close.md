## Why Wont My Frigidaire Dishwasher Close? Easy Fixes Explained

It is frustrating when your Frigidaire dishwasher refuses to close. A dishwasher that will not close properly cannot start a wash cycle. This issue disrupts your kitchen routine and leaves dirty dishes piled up. You want your kitchen appliance to work as expected.

I have faced this problem myself, and it is usually fixable. This guide helps you understand why your Frigidaire dishwasher door will not close. We will go through common causes and simple solutions. You will learn to identify the problem and fix it. We will cover everything from simple obstructions to more complex part failures.

### Takeaway

When your Frigidaire dishwasher will not close, check these points first:

*   **Remove Obstructions:** Make sure no items block the door.
*   **Inspect Latch:** Look for damage or misalignment in the door latch.
*   **Check Hinges:** Examine hinges for bending or looseness.
*   **Adjust Racks:** Ensure racks are pushed in and loaded correctly.
*   **Level Dishwasher:** Verify the dishwasher sits level on the floor.

A Frigidaire dishwasher will not close primarily due to physical obstructions, a faulty door latch, misaligned hinges, or improper loading of dishes. Resolving the issue often involves checking for blockages, inspecting the door mechanism, or adjusting the applianceâ€™s position. Many common causes are simple to fix at home.

## Understanding the Frigidaire Dishwasher Door Mechanism

Your Frigidaire dishwasher door needs to close tightly to operate. This tight closure prevents water leaks during a wash cycle. It also ensures the wash cycle starts properly. The door system includes several parts that work together.

The door latch is a main component. It secures the door to the dishwasher frame. When you push the door shut, the latch engages with a strike plate. This strike plate is usually located on the top panel of the dishwasher. If the latch or strike plate is bent or broken, the door will not stay shut.

Door hinges support the door's weight. They also allow the door to swing open and close smoothly. Hinges can become loose or bent over time. Damaged hinges prevent the door from aligning correctly with the dishwasher opening. This misalignment makes closing the door difficult.

Door springs help balance the door's weight. They ensure the door opens and closes with ease. If a spring breaks or stretches, the door may feel too heavy. It might also drop suddenly when opened. This can affect how the door lines up when you try to close it. Understanding these parts helps you troubleshoot why your Frigidaire dishwasher door will not close.

## Common Obstructions Preventing Dishwasher Door Closure

One of the simplest reasons your Frigidaire dishwasher door will not close is an obstruction. Before you check complex parts, always look inside the dishwasher. Small items can easily block the door's path. This prevents the door from fully latching.

Dishwasher racks are a common culprit. If a rack is not pushed in completely, it can hit the door. Ensure both the upper and lower racks slide fully back into their positions. Sometimes, a dish or piece of cutlery can extend beyond the rack. A tall pot or a long spoon might stick out, hitting the inner door panel. Always check that all items are inside the dishwasher's footprint.

The silverware basket might also cause an issue. If the basket is misplaced or overloaded, it could prevent the door from closing. Make sure the basket is properly seated in its designated spot. Also, check that no utensils are sticking out of the top. Even a small item like a stray bottle cap or a forgotten plastic container can block the door.

Sometimes, the dishwasher itself is obstructed. Pull the dishwasher out slightly from its cabinet if possible. Look for anything behind or around it that might be pushing it forward. A misplaced power cord or water line can push the dishwasher out. This can cause it to misalign with the cabinet opening. A quick check for these simple obstructions can save you time and effort.

## Troubleshooting a Faulty Frigidaire Dishwasher Latch Assembly

The door latch is essential for your Frigidaire dishwasher to close. If the door will not close, the latch assembly is a likely suspect. This part engages with a strike plate to secure the door. A faulty latch is a common reason for a door not closing.

First, visually inspect the latch mechanism. It is usually located at the top center of the dishwasher door. Look for any visible damage or signs of wear. The plastic or metal components can break or become bent over time. Sometimes, food debris or detergent residue can build up on the latch. This prevents it from engaging properly. Clean the latch area thoroughly with a damp cloth.

Next, examine the strike plate. This is the part on the dishwasher tub that the latch hooks into. The strike plate can also get bent or broken. A misaligned strike plate will not allow the latch to connect. If the strike plate is slightly bent, you might be able to gently bend it back into position with pliers. Be careful not to break it.

If both the latch and strike plate appear fine, the issue might be internal. The latch mechanism may have a sensor or switch that is not working. This switch tells the dishwasher the door is closed. If the switch is faulty, the dishwasher thinks the door is open. It will not start a cycle. Replacing a faulty latch assembly is a common repair. You can find replacement parts specific to your Frigidaire model. Sometimes, another brand might have similar latch issues, such as when a [Whirlpool dishwasher door won't close](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-close). This indicates the latch is a common point of failure across various appliance brands.

## Addressing Issues with Frigidaire Dishwasher Door Hinges and Springs

Dishwasher door hinges and springs play a vital role in proper door operation. If your Frigidaire dishwasher door feels too heavy, drops quickly, or does not align, these components might be the problem. They ensure the door moves smoothly and stays in position.

The door hinges are located at the bottom sides of the door. They allow the door to pivot open and closed. Over time, hinges can become loose, bent, or even break. If a hinge is bent, the door will not line up correctly with the dishwasher opening. This prevents the latch from engaging. You might notice the door sags or is crooked. Inspect both hinges for any signs of damage or wear.

Door springs are usually connected to the hinges. They provide tension, balancing the door's weight. If a spring breaks or loses its tension, the door will feel very heavy. It will not stay open at certain angles. This makes closing the door difficult. It also puts more stress on the latch. Replacing broken door springs often restores proper door function.

Replacing hinges or springs can be more involved. You might need to pull the dishwasher out from under the counter. Accessing these parts often requires removing the outer door panel or side panels. If you need to put components back together, instructions on [how to put a Frigidaire dishwasher back together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-frigidaire-dishwasher-back-together) can be very helpful. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before attempting any repairs. If you are unsure about replacing these parts, consider calling a professional technician.

## Inspecting and Adjusting Frigidaire Dishwasher Leveling and Rack Alignment

Proper leveling of your Frigidaire dishwasher is crucial for its door to close correctly. If the appliance is not level, the door frame can twist slightly. This small twist can prevent the latch from lining up with the strike plate. A dishwasher that rocks or wobbles is probably not level.

To check leveling, place a spirit level across the top edge of the dishwasher. Check it front-to-back and side-to-side. Most dishwashers have adjustable legs at the bottom. You can raise or lower these legs to ensure the unit is perfectly level. Adjusting the front legs is often done by turning them by hand or with a wrench. Some models might have rear legs adjusted from the front. Make small adjustments and recheck the level.

Dishwasher racks must also be aligned properly. We discussed this briefly with obstructions, but it is worth a deeper look. If racks are not fully pushed in, the door will hit them. Sometimes, the wheels on the racks can come off their tracks. This makes the rack sit unevenly. When a rack is off-track, it sticks out more than it should.

Ensure all wheels are securely on their tracks. If a wheel is broken, it may need replacement. Also, check that the dishware itself is loaded correctly. Tall items placed in the wrong spot can interfere with the door. Avoid placing large platters or cutting boards that lean against the door frame. Proper loading and leveling ensure the door has a clear path to close and latch securely.

## Examining the Frigidaire Dishwasher Door Gasket and Strike Plate

The door gasket and strike plate are key components for a secure and leak-free dishwasher door closure. If your Frigidaire dishwasher door will not close, these parts deserve a thorough check. They ensure a tight seal and proper latch engagement.

The door gasket, or door seal, runs along the perimeter of the dishwasher opening. Its purpose is to prevent water from leaking out during operation. Over time, the gasket can become hard, cracked, or deformed. It might also shift out of its channel. A damaged or dislodged gasket can create resistance when closing the door. This resistance might stop the door from fully latching. Inspect the gasket for tears, stiffness, or any areas where it sticks out. You can try to push it back into its groove if it is merely dislodged. If it is damaged, replacing the door gasket is necessary.

The strike plate works with the door latch. It is the metal or plastic piece on the dishwasher tub that the latch engages with. A common issue is a misaligned or bent strike plate. If it is slightly out of position, the door latch will not catch it. Gently push the door closed and see if the latch lines up with the strike plate. If it is off, you might be able to adjust it. Some strike plates are held by screws and can be repositioned. Others might be integral to the dishwasher frame and harder to adjust.

Sometimes, the strike plate itself can be worn down or broken. This is especially true if it is made of plastic. A worn strike plate might not provide a solid point for the latch to hold onto. Replacing a damaged strike plate is usually a straightforward process. Ensure you get the correct part for your specific Frigidaire model. These small components are vital for your dishwasher to seal and operate correctly.

## When to Call a Professional for Frigidaire Dishwasher Repair

While many Frigidaire dishwasher door issues are fixable at home, some problems require professional help. Knowing when to call a technician can save you time, prevent further damage, and ensure safety. Do not hesitate to seek expert assistance if you are unsure.

If you have tried all the basic troubleshooting steps without success, it is a good sign to call a pro. This includes checking for obstructions, inspecting the latch, hinges, springs, and ensuring the dishwasher is level. If the door still will not close after these checks, the problem might be more complex. This could involve internal wiring, control board issues, or hidden damage.

Certain repairs involve working with electrical components or plumbing connections. If you are not comfortable with these types of tasks, a professional is the safest choice. Incorrectly handling electrical parts can cause shocks or further damage to the appliance. Mishandling water lines can lead to leaks and water damage in your home. For example, if your Frigidaire dishwasher has power but will not start, it points to electrical issues beyond a simple door fix, [Why does my Frigidaire dishwasher have power but won't start?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-dishwasher-have-power-but-wont-start) is a question best answered by a professional if basic troubleshooting fails.

Attempting complex repairs without the proper knowledge can lead to breaking more parts. It might even void your warranty. A qualified appliance repair technician can diagnose the problem accurately. They can perform the repair efficiently and safely, getting your Frigidaire dishwasher back in working order.
