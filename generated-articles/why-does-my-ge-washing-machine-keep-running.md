## Why Your GE Washing Machine Keeps Running: Common Fixes

It can be frustrating when your washing machine never seems to finish a cycle. Many GE washing machine owners experience this problem: the machine runs continuously. This issue wastes water, energy, and your time. I understand how disruptive a malfunctioning appliance can be. You just want your laundry done. This guide explores the reasons your GE washing machine might keep running. We will look at common parts that fail and steps you can take to diagnose and fix the problem. By the end, you will understand how to get your washer working properly again.

### Takeaway

If your GE washing machine keeps running, check these components:
*   The water level sensor or pressure switch.
*   The drain pump and drain hose for clogs.
*   The main control board for electrical faults.
*   The lid switch or door lock mechanism.
*   Water inlet valve for constant filling.

### Why Does My GE Washing Machine Keep Running?

Your GE washing machine keeps running because it fails to complete a cycle step or detect its completion. This often happens due to issues with the water level sensor, drain system, or the main control board. The machine gets stuck in a loop, trying to advance the cycle without success.

### Understanding Your GE Washer's Cycle

A washing machine cycle involves several distinct phases. Your GE washing machine performs these steps in order. First, it fills with water. Next, it agitates or tumbles clothes to wash them. Then, it drains the dirty water. Finally, it spins to remove excess water. Each step relies on various sensors and components working correctly. If one step does not complete, the machine can get stuck. It may try to repeat a step endlessly. Knowing this helps diagnose why your GE washing machine keeps running.

The machine has a "brain" called the control board. It sends signals to all parts. Sensors report back to the control board. For example, a water level sensor tells the board when enough water has entered. A tachometer sensor tells the board the motor speed. If these sensors give incorrect signals, the control board gets confused. It might continue to fill, drain, or spin. This leads to the machine running non-stop. We need to check these parts.

### Faulty Water Level Sensor or Pressure Switch

A common reason your GE washing machine keeps running is a faulty water level sensor or pressure switch. This part measures the water inside the tub. When the tub fills to the correct level, the pressure switch sends a signal. This signal tells the control board to stop filling and start the wash cycle. If the switch fails, it might not send the signal. The washer will continue to fill, waiting for a signal that never comes. This leads to an endless fill cycle.

Sometimes, the air trap hose connected to the pressure switch gets clogged. This hose carries air pressure from the bottom of the tub to the switch. A clog prevents accurate pressure readings. The switch then thinks there is not enough water, even if the tub is full. This causes the washer to continue filling or attempt to drain constantly. You can inspect this hose for blockages. Clear any debris you find. Replacing a faulty pressure switch often solves this problem. It is a straightforward repair for many DIYers.

If your GE washing machine struggles to fill correctly, or if it overflows, this sensor is a prime suspect. A simple test involves blowing into the pressure switch tube to see if it clicks. If it does not click, the switch is likely faulty. You may also notice your [GE washing machine not filling up with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ge-washing-machine-not-filling-up-with-water) or struggling with water levels in other ways. Always disconnect power before checking any internal components.

### Drainage System Issues: Clogs and Malfunctions

Another major reason your GE washing machine keeps running relates to its drainage system. If the washer cannot drain water properly, it will not advance to the spin cycle. The machine might keep attempting to drain, or it might get stuck in an endless rinse cycle. This problem often stems from a clogged drain pump or a blocked drain hose.

The drain pump removes water from the tub. Over time, lint, small clothing items, or debris can get trapped in the pump. This debris prevents the pump from working efficiently. It may run but fail to move water out. You might hear the pump motor running continuously but no water drains. Check the pump filter or trap first. Many GE models have an accessible filter at the bottom front. Clear any debris from it.

The drain hose can also become clogged. This hose leads from the washing machine to your standpipe or utility sink. A build-up of lint and soap scum can restrict water flow. Sometimes, the hose might be kinked or crushed. Ensure the hose is clear and properly routed. If water is not draining, the machine's control board will sense the water still present. It will command the pump to keep running, trying to empty the tub. This is a common reason why your GE washing machine keeps running endlessly. If your machine is also [taking too long to complete a cycle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-washing-machine-take-so-long), a drainage issue could be contributing.

### Malfunctioning Main Control Board

The main control board acts as the central processing unit for your GE washing machine. It controls all functions: water filling, agitation, draining, and spinning. If this board malfunctions, it can send incorrect signals to other components. It might fail to receive signals properly. This can cause the washer to get stuck in a loop. The board might endlessly command a component to run, even if the task is complete.

For example, a faulty control board might not recognize that the tub has drained. It would then keep the drain pump running indefinitely. Or, it might fail to advance the cycle from wash to rinse, making the machine seem stuck. Control board issues are harder to diagnose than clogs. They often require a multimeter to test continuity and voltage. You might notice other erratic behaviors if the control board is the problem. These include lights flickering, buttons not responding, or error codes appearing.

Replacing a control board is a more complex repair. It often requires specific part numbers for your model. It is best to consult your owner's manual or a service technician for this. Sometimes, a power reset can temporarily clear minor board glitches. Unplug the machine for a few minutes, then plug it back in. This might reset the board and resolve a temporary communication error. If your machine stops mid-cycle often, a failing control board could also be the culprit.

### Lid Switch or Door Latch Assembly Faults

Modern GE washing machines have safety mechanisms. These include a lid switch for top-loaders or a door latch assembly for front-loaders. These mechanisms ensure the machine does not operate with the lid open or the door unlocked. If this switch or latch malfunctions, the washing machine might not start or complete a cycle. It might pause indefinitely, waiting for the safety signal.

For top-loader GE washing machines, the lid switch must be engaged for the machine to agitate or spin. If the switch is faulty, the machine might fill with water but then do nothing. It might just sit there, running the fill cycle indefinitely. It thinks the lid is open. For front-loaders, the door latch assembly locks the door during the cycle. A faulty latch might prevent the cycle from starting. It could also make the machine believe the door is still open. This prevents the cycle from advancing.

You can often visually inspect these parts. Check if the latch is broken or misaligned. Test the switch for continuity with a multimeter if you are comfortable with electrical testing. Sometimes, lint or debris can get into the lid switch mechanism. Cleaning it can restore function. If the part is physically broken, it needs replacement. This is a common, relatively simple DIY repair.

### Water Inlet Valve Malfunction

The water inlet valve controls water flow into your GE washing machine. It opens to let water in and closes when the correct level is reached. If this valve malfunctions, it can cause the machine to keep running in a fill cycle. A faulty inlet valve might get stuck in a partially open position. This would lead to a slow, continuous drip of water into the tub.

The machineâ€™s water level sensor would detect this slow, constant increase in water. It would then signal the control board that the tub is overfilling. In response, the control board might continuously activate the drain pump. The washer becomes stuck in an endless loop: filling slowly and draining slowly. This happens even if the wash cycle should have ended. You may also notice the water fill cycle running longer than normal, or hear a faint trickling sound when the washer is off.

Sometimes, debris from your water supply can clog the small screens on the inlet valve. This reduces water pressure, making the fill cycle take too long. The machine keeps filling, waiting for the pressure switch to activate. Cleaning these screens can resolve the issue. However, if the valve itself is faulty and not closing properly, it needs replacement. A clear sign is water constantly entering the machine even when it should not be. Learning [how to clean your water inlet valve on a GE washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-water-inlet-valve-on-ge-washing-machine) can sometimes prevent this issue.

### Overfilling or Overflow Condition

An overfilling condition often makes your GE washing machine keep running. This happens when the washer fills with too much water. It usually points back to issues with the water level sensor, pressure switch, or the water inlet valve. If the machine overfills, its internal safety mechanisms activate. The control board tries to correct the problem. It will engage the drain pump to remove excess water.

However, if the sensor or valve is still malfunctioning, the machine gets caught in a loop. It keeps filling, then keeps draining. It never settles at the correct water level. This leads to the washer continuously running, trying to balance the water inside. You might notice water leaking from the machine or pooling on the floor if it truly overflows.

Check the water level sensor or pressure switch first. Ensure its air trap hose is clear. Also, inspect the water inlet valve for leaks or signs of constant dripping. If the machine cannot sense the proper water level, it will never complete the fill cycle. It will keep running its pump and trying to adjust. This creates an endless cycle that wastes water and energy. Addressing the root cause of the overfill, whether it is a sensor or a valve, will stop the continuous running.

### General Maintenance and Prevention Tips

Regular maintenance helps prevent issues like your GE washing machine running continuously. Simple steps can extend the life of your appliance. These actions also ensure it operates efficiently. Ignoring maintenance can lead to more complex problems later.

*   **Clean the Drain Pump Filter:** Check and clean the drain pump filter every few months. Lint, coins, or small items can clog it. A clogged filter restricts water flow, causing drainage problems. This makes your GE washing machine keep running the drain cycle.
*   **Inspect Hoses:** Periodically check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. Make sure the water inlet hoses are not crimped. Ensure the air trap hose for the pressure switch is clear.
*   **Run a Cleaning Cycle:** Use a washing machine cleaner or white vinegar to clean the tub. This prevents mold and detergent residue buildup. Buildup can affect sensors or create blockages.
