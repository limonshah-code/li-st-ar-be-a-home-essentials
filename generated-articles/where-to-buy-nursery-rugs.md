This article guides you on where to buy nursery rugs. We will explore various options, both online and in physical stores. You can find rugs that fit any budget and style.

You can buy nursery rugs from many places. Top choices include large online retailers like Amazon and Wayfair. You also find them at specialty baby stores such as Pottery Barn Kids. Big box stores like Target and IKEA offer affordable options. Many direct-to-consumer brands sell safe, stylish rugs online too.

## Shopping for Nursery Rugs Online: Huge Selection and Convenience

Online shopping offers many benefits when you want to buy **nursery rugs**. You can see thousands of options from your home. Filters help you find the right size, color, and material. This makes comparing prices easy. Customer reviews also give insights into rug quality and how it looks in real life. I often start my rug search online to get ideas.

### Popular Online Retailers

Several online stores are known for their rug selections. Amazon provides a vast marketplace. You can find rugs from many brands and at different price points there. Wayfair also has an extensive collection. They often feature sales and a wide range of styles. These sites make it simple to explore many choices quickly.

Pottery Barn Kids and Crate & Kids focus on children's decor. They offer curated collections of high-quality **nursery rugs**. Their designs often match other nursery items. This helps create a cohesive look. While prices may be higher, the quality and style often justify the cost. For more general online rug shopping, you might consider [where to buy good quality rugs online](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-to-buy-good-quality-rugs-online). This can give you a broader perspective on reputable online rug sellers.

### Direct-to-Consumer Brands

Many brands now sell rugs directly from their websites. Ruggable is one popular example. They make washable rugs, which is perfect for a nursery. Lorena Canals also offers washable, non-toxic rugs. These brands often highlight their materials and safety features. Buying direct means you support a specific company's mission. It also often comes with good customer service. I find these brands often have unique designs you will not see everywhere else.

When you buy a rug online, check the return policy. Colors can look different on a screen. It is good to know you can return the rug if it does not work. Read product descriptions carefully. Look at dimensions and material details. This helps avoid surprises when the rug arrives at your door.

## Discovering Nursery Rugs at Specialty Children's Stores

Specialty children's stores offer a unique shopping experience. These shops focus only on items for babies and kids. They often have experts who can help you choose. You can touch and feel the rugs before buying them. This is a big plus when you want to check softness and quality. I find that seeing a rug in person gives me a better idea of its true color.

### Dedicated Baby Boutiques

Local baby boutiques often carry charming **nursery rugs**. These stores select their products carefully. They might feature smaller, independent rug brands. You can find unique designs that stand out from mass-produced items. Shop staff can also give advice on what works well in a nursery setting. They understand the specific needs of parents.

Visiting these stores supports local businesses. It also gives you a chance to see items that are truly special. Prices at boutiques might be higher than big online retailers. But you get personalized service and often higher-quality, unique items. Look for stores that emphasize natural or non-toxic materials. This is important for a baby's room.

### Furniture and Decor Stores with Children's Sections

Many larger furniture and home decor stores have dedicated children's sections. Restoration Hardware Baby & Child and Crate & Barrel Kids are examples. These stores offer upscale **nursery rug** options. Their rugs are often part of a wider collection. You can find matching furniture and decor items easily. This helps create a coordinated look for the nursery.

The rugs in these sections are usually high-quality. They might feature luxurious materials. These stores often have showrooms where you can see the rugs in a room setting. This helps you imagine the rug in your own nursery. Sales associates can also provide design tips. They can help you pick the right rug size and style for your space.

## Finding Nursery Rugs at Big Box Stores and Home Goods

Big box stores and home goods retailers offer accessible options. These stores are convenient for many shoppers. They provide a range of styles at various price points. You can often find a **nursery rug** during your regular shopping trips. This saves time and effort. I often check these stores for quick and affordable solutions.

### Major Retail Chains

Target and Walmart carry a selection of rugs suitable for nurseries. Their rug sections usually include playful designs and soft textures. These stores often have washable options. This is a big plus for busy parents. Prices are generally budget-friendly, making it easy to buy a good rug without spending too much.

The downside is that the specific "nursery" rug selection might be smaller. You may need to look at general area rugs. But many general rugs can work well in a nursery. Look for soft, low-pile rugs in cheerful colors. These stores are good for finding a quick rug solution. They are also convenient for returns if the rug does not fit your space.

### Home Decor and Discount Stores

HomeGoods, TJ Maxx, and Marshalls are treasure troves for home decor. Their inventory changes often, so you never know what you might find. You can discover unique **nursery rugs** at discounted prices. The key is to visit often. If you see a rug you like, buy it quickly. It might not be there tomorrow.

I have found amazing deals on high-quality rugs at these stores. The selection can be hit or miss. But the prices are usually excellent. Check the rug carefully for any flaws before buying. Since these stores sell surplus or past-season items, returns might be more limited. Always check their return policy before purchasing.

IKEA also offers modern and functional rugs. Their rugs are known for affordability. Many are machine washable or easy to clean. IKEA rugs fit well in minimalist or contemporary nursery designs. They also offer anti-slip underlays separately, which is crucial for safety.

## Choosing Eco-Friendly and Non-Toxic Nursery Rugs

When you buy a **nursery rug**, safety is paramount. Babies spend a lot of time on the floor. They crawl, play, and even mouth things. Choosing eco-friendly and non-toxic materials is very important. These rugs help create a healthier environment for your child. I always look for specific certifications.

### Understanding Safe Materials

Several materials are safe for nursery rugs.
*   **Organic Cotton:** This material is soft, natural, and breathable. It often comes without harsh dyes. Look for GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified cotton.
*   **Wool:** Wool is naturally flame-resistant and durable. It also resists dirt and dust mites. Some wool can be scratchy, so check for softness. For more on affordable wool options, consider [how to buy wool rugs for cheap](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-buy-wool-rugs-for-cheap).
*   **Jute or Sisal (Natural Fibers):** These offer a rustic look. They are durable but can be rough. They might not be ideal for crawling babies.
*   **TENCEL™ Lyocell:** This is a sustainable fiber. It comes from wood pulp. It is very soft and has a silk-like feel.
*   **Polyester/Polypropylene:** These are synthetic materials. They are often affordable and easy to clean. However, some can contain VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). Look for specific certifications for low VOC emissions. For more information, you can check [is polypropalene ok for a nursery rug](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-polypropalene-ok-for-a-nursery-rug).

### Key Certifications to Look For

Certifications help you identify safer rugs.
*   **Oeko-Tex Standard 100:** This certification means the textile is free from harmful substances. It tests for a long list of chemicals.
*   **GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard):** This standard ensures organic status of textiles. It covers raw material harvesting and environmentally responsible manufacturing.
*   **GREENGUARD Gold Certified:** This certification means the product has low chemical emissions. This is important for indoor air quality. It shows the rug meets strict chemical emission limits.

When you shop, ask about the rug's dyes and backing materials. Some rug backings can contain latex or glues with VOCs. Look for natural latex or cotton backings. Many brands now offer transparent information on their websites. This helps you make informed choices for your baby's health.

## Key Features to Consider When Buying a Nursery Rug

Choosing the right **nursery rug** goes beyond just looks. You need to think about how it functions in a baby's room. Babies crawl, play, and sometimes make messes. The rug should handle all of this. I always consider several key features before making a purchase.

### Size and Placement

The rug's size is crucial. A small rug can define a play area. A large rug can anchor the entire room.
*   **Under the crib:** A rug can go partly under the crib. It should extend beyond the crib by at least a foot on all sides. This helps tie the room together.
*   **Play area:** A smaller, soft rug can create a designated play spot. This gives your baby a comfortable place to explore.
*   **Room coverage:** For larger nurseries, a rug can cover most of the floor. This provides maximum softness and sound absorption.

Measure the room before you shop. Use painter's tape to mark out rug dimensions on the floor. This helps visualize the size better.

### Pile Height and Texture

The pile height refers to the length of the rug fibers.
*   **Low Pile:** These rugs are easier to clean. They also do not trap as much dust. They are safer for crawling babies. Tiny fingers and toes will not get caught.
*   **Medium Pile:** These offer more cushioning. They are still relatively easy to clean.
*   **High Pile (Shag):** These are very soft and cozy. But they are harder to clean. They can also be a tripping hazard for toddlers. Dust and allergens can hide deep in the fibers. For a nursery, a low to medium pile is usually best. The rug's texture should be soft and inviting. Avoid rough or scratchy materials.

### Washability and Maintenance

Babies make messes. Spills, spit-up, and diaper leaks happen. A washable rug is a lifesaver.
*   **Machine Washable:** Some rugs can go directly into a washing machine. This is the easiest to clean. Ruggable is a brand known for this feature.
*   **Spot Cleanable:** Most rugs require spot cleaning for spills. You need a good rug cleaner for quick clean-ups.
*   **Durable Materials:** Choose materials that stand up to wear and tear. Wool and synthetic fibers like nylon are durable. They resist stains well.

### Non-Slip Backing

Safety is key. A rug that slides is a falling hazard.
*   **Built-in non-slip:** Some rugs come with rubber or latex backing. This helps them stay in place.
*   **Rug Pad:** If your chosen rug does not have a non-slip backing, buy a rug pad. A good rug pad adds cushioning and prevents slips. It also protects your floor. Consider if you need a rug at all in the nursery. Sometimes you do not.

## Tips for Buying the Best Nursery Rug

Shopping for a **nursery rug** is an exciting part of preparing for a baby. To make sure you pick the perfect one, keep a few smart tips in mind. These ideas will help you find a rug that is both beautiful and functional for your baby's room. I like to approach rug shopping with a clear plan.

### Set a Budget

Rugs come in a wide range of prices. You can find options from under $50 to several hundred dollars. Decide how much you want to spend beforehand. This helps narrow down your choices. Remember that a nursery rug might need replacing as your child grows. Or, it might face more wear and tear than other rugs. So, balance cost with durability and style. It is possible to find stylish and safe rugs at every price point. Do not feel you must spend a fortune.

### Measure Your Space

Always measure the nursery floor area where the rug will go. Imagine how the rug will fit. Do you want it under the crib, in a play corner, or covering most of the room? Use painter's tape on the floor to visualize different rug sizes. This simple step helps prevent buying a rug that is too big or too small. An ill-fitting rug can make a room look awkward. Proper sizing makes the room feel balanced and complete.

### Read Reviews and Check Safety Information

When buying online, customer reviews are gold. They tell you about the rug's true color, texture, and durability. Look for comments on shedding or off-gassing. Off-gassing is the release of chemicals into the air. This is important for a baby's room. Pay attention to reviews that mention how easy the rug is to clean. Always check for certifications like Oeko-Tex or GREENGUARD Gold. These mean the rug is free from harmful chemicals. This protects your baby's health.

### Consider the Overall Nursery Theme

The rug should complement the nursery's design. Think about the colors and patterns already in the room.
*   **Color Scheme:** Choose a rug that matches or contrasts nicely with walls and furniture. A neutral rug can provide a calm base. A colorful rug can add a playful touch.
*   **Pattern:** Decide if you want a solid color, geometric pattern, or whimsical design. A busy pattern can hide stains well. A simple pattern creates a serene space.
*   **Future Growth:** Babies grow fast. Consider a rug design that can transition as your child gets older. A timeless pattern might last longer than a very specific baby-themed design.

## Maintaining Your Nursery Rug: Keeping It Clean and Safe

Once you buy your **nursery rug**, proper care ensures it lasts. A clean rug contributes to a healthy environment for your baby. Maintaining a rug in a baby's room is important because of spills and dust. I always follow a few simple steps to keep my rugs looking good and staying safe.

### Regular Vacuuming

Vacuum your nursery rug often. Dust, dirt, and pet dander can settle in the fibers. For low-pile rugs, vacuum a few times a week. For medium-pile rugs, vacuum at least once a week. Use a vacuum with good suction. If your vacuum has a rotating brush, make sure it is gentle. Too strong a brush can damage rug fibers. Regular vacuuming removes surface dirt. It also keeps allergens low. This is especially important for babies with sensitive airways.

### Immediate Spot Cleaning

Accidents happen. Spills, spit-up, or food messes are common in a nursery. Clean spills immediately.
*   **Blot, Do Not Rub:** Use a clean, white cloth or paper towel. Gently blot the spill from the outside in. Rubbing pushes the stain deeper into the fibers.
*   **Use Mild Cleaner:** Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with water. Apply it to the cloth, not directly to the rug. Blot the stained area.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Blot the area with a damp cloth to rinse the soap. Then, blot dry with a clean, dry towel. Allow the rug to air dry completely. Quick action prevents stains from setting.

### Deep Cleaning

Every few months, or as needed, give your rug a deeper clean.
*   **Machine Washable Rugs:** If your rug is machine washable, follow the care instructions. Use a gentle cycle and mild detergent. Air dry or tumble dry on low, if allowed. This is the easiest way to refresh a rug.
*   **Professional Cleaning:** For larger rugs or those not machine washable, consider professional cleaning. They have special equipment to clean rugs deeply without damage. This can extend the life of your rug significantly. They can also remove tough stains.
*   **Home Steam Cleaning:** Some rug steam cleaners can be used at home. Always test a small, hidden area first. Make sure the cleaning solution is safe for your rug material.

### Protect from Sunlight and Wear

Direct sunlight can fade a rug's colors over time. If your nursery gets a lot of sun, rotate the rug every few months. This helps ensure even wear and color distribution. Use furniture pads under heavy items on the rug. This prevents permanent indentations. If a part of the rug gets heavy traffic, try to rearrange furniture to distribute the wear. Proper maintenance keeps your **nursery rug** looking fresh and inviting for years.

## FAQ Section: Your Questions About Nursery Rugs Answered

### How big should a nursery rug be?

The ideal rug size depends on your nursery's dimensions and layout. For most nurseries, a 5x7 or 6x9 foot rug works well. It can sit partly under the crib and extend into the room. This anchors the space. If you want a small play area, a 3x5 foot rug is good. Always measure your room first.

### What materials are best for nursery rugs?

Soft, durable, and non-toxic materials are best. Organic cotton, wool, and TENCEL™ Lyocell are excellent choices. They are natural and safe. If choosing synthetics like polyester or polypropylene, look for Oeko-Tex or GREENGUARD Gold certifications. These ensure low chemical emissions and safety for babies.

### Are washable nursery rugs a good idea?

Yes, washable nursery rugs are highly practical. Babies often make messes, including spills, spit-up, and diaper leaks. A machine-washable rug makes cleaning much easier. You can simply put it in the washing machine. This helps maintain hygiene and keeps the nursery fresh.

### How often should I clean a nursery rug?

Vacuum your nursery rug at least once a week. If your baby spends a lot of time on it or if you have pets, vacuum more often. Spot clean spills immediately to prevent stains. For a deeper clean, consider a professional cleaning or machine washing (if applicable) every 3-6 months.

### Do I need a rug in a nursery with carpet?

Even if your nursery has carpet, a rug can still be beneficial. A rug adds a layer of softness and extra cushioning for your baby to play on. It also absorbs sound, making the room quieter. A rug can define specific zones, like a play area or reading nook. It also adds color and texture to the room's design.
