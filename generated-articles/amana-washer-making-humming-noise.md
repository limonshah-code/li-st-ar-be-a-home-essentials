## Troubleshooting Your Amana Washer's Humming Noise

Picture this: You start a load of laundry, expect the familiar swish of water, but instead, your Amana washer makes a humming noise. This sound can be alarming. It signals that something is not right with your machine. I understand how frustrating a noisy appliance can be in a busy home.

A humming Amana washer needs attention. Ignoring the sound can lead to bigger problems. This guide will help you understand common causes of a humming noise. We will explore various components that might be at fault. You will learn simple steps to diagnose and potentially fix the issue yourself. Sometimes, you may need a professional. We will cover when to call an expert.

### Takeaway: Understanding Your Washer's Hum

*   **Identify the Sound:** Listen carefully to determine the type and location of the humming.
*   **Safety First:** Always unplug your Amana washer before inspection or repair.
*   **Check Key Components:** Inspect the motor, drain pump, water inlet valve, and drive system.
*   **Look for Obstructions:** Foreign objects can cause mechanical parts to hum.
*   **Professional Help:** Know when the repair exceeds your skill level or safety limits.

### Why Your Amana Washer Makes a Humming Noise

Your Amana washer makes a humming noise usually because a component attempts to operate but cannot. This can happen due to an obstruction, a failing electrical part, or a mechanical issue. Common culprits include the motor, drain pump, or water inlet valve. The sound indicates a part is receiving power but facing resistance or internal failure.

### Understanding the Amana Washer Humming Noise: Initial Diagnosis

When your Amana washer starts making a humming noise, it often feels like the machine is speaking to you. This sound is not normal during operation. It indicates that a component inside is struggling. We need to listen closely to this specific hum.

The nature of the hum provides clues. Is it a high-pitched whine or a low, vibrating rumble? Does it occur at the start of the cycle, during filling, or when the machine tries to drain? Pinpointing the exact timing helps narrow down the problem. We also need to consider if the washer is filling with water, agitating, or spinning. Each phase involves different components.

Before we do anything else, safety is the top priority. Always unplug your Amana washer from its power outlet. This simple step prevents electrical shock. You also avoid accidental activation of parts. We want to work on a safe machine.

Next, remove any laundry from inside the drum. A balanced load allows us to test components without obstruction. Sometimes, an overloaded machine can strain parts, causing a hum. This initial check creates a clear working environment. I always make sure the washer is empty.

### Common Culprits: Why Your Amana Washer Hums

Several parts inside your Amana washer can cause a humming noise. Each part plays a critical role in the wash cycle. When one struggles, it sends out a distinct signal. We will examine the most frequent sources of trouble.

#### The Drive Motor

The motor is the heart of your washer. It powers the agitation and spin cycles. If the motor hums but the drum does not move, it could mean several things. The motor might be trying to start but cannot. This happens if the motor windings are failing. It also occurs if a capacitor is weak.

A motor can hum if it is overloaded. Check if you put too many clothes in the washer. An unbalanced load also strains the motor. Sometimes, the motor’s internal bearings wear out. This causes a grinding hum. I often hear this kind of hum when the machine tries to spin.

#### The Drain Pump

The drain pump removes water from the washer tub. If your Amana washer makes a humming noise during the drain cycle, the pump is likely the problem. A blockage in the pump or drain hose is a common cause. Small items like socks, coins, or lint can get trapped inside. These items prevent the impeller from spinning freely.

When the pump motor tries to spin but cannot, it hums loudly. The hum indicates power is going to the pump, but there is resistance. A failing drain pump motor can also hum without obstruction. Its internal components might be worn out. I have seen many cases where a simple blockage caused a significant hum.

#### The Water Inlet Valve

The water inlet valve controls water flow into the washer. It has solenoids that open and close. If one of these solenoids fails, it can produce a humming sound. This hum often happens when the washer attempts to fill. The valve might not open fully.

A partially open valve restricts water flow. This makes the solenoid buzz or hum. Sediment or mineral buildup can cause this issue. The valve is receiving power but cannot complete its task. Sometimes, the hum occurs briefly then stops. Other times, it continues throughout the fill cycle.

#### Drive Belt and Pulley

For some Amana washer models, a drive belt connects the motor to the transmission or tub. A worn or loose drive belt can cause a hum. The belt may slip on the pulleys. This slipping creates friction and a humming sound. The hum often occurs during agitation or spin.

Inspect the belt for cracks, fraying, or excessive slack. The pulleys themselves can also be faulty. A misaligned or damaged pulley can cause the belt to bind. This binding results in a humming noise. Always check the belt tension.

### Motor and Drive System: A Deeper Dive into the Humming Sound

When your Amana washer hums, the motor and drive system are often the first suspects. These components work together to agitate clothes and spin water out. Understanding their function helps pinpoint the exact problem. I find this area requires careful attention.

#### Inspecting the Drive Motor

The drive motor uses electricity to create rotational force. If you hear a hum but no movement, the motor might be stalled. This can happen if the motor has gone bad internally. Sometimes, it is a problem with the motor's starting capacitor. The capacitor gives the motor an extra jolt to get going. If it fails, the motor receives power but lacks the push to turn. It just sits there and hums.

I like to test the motor directly if I suspect it. First, remove the drive belt if your model has one. Then, try to start a cycle. If the motor still hums without turning, the motor or its capacitor is likely faulty. A technician can use a multimeter to test the capacitor's capacitance. This confirms if it is within specifications. A burnt smell from the motor area also indicates a motor issue.

#### Examining the Drive System Components

Beyond the motor, the drive system includes several mechanical parts. These parts transfer the motor's power to the washer tub.

*   **Drive Belt:** Many Amana washers use a drive belt. Check the belt for damage or looseness. If it is cracked, frayed, or stretched, it needs replacement. A loose belt can slip on the pulleys, causing a humming sound. This slipping reduces efficiency and creates heat.
*   **Pulleys:** Inspect all pulleys connected to the motor and tub. They should spin freely. Look for any signs of wear, damage, or misalignment. A bent or seized pulley will put stress on the motor. This stress can lead to a humming noise.
*   **Transmission:** In direct drive models, the motor connects directly to the transmission. If the transmission gears are worn or seized, the motor will hum. It tries to turn the gears but cannot. This is often a more complex repair. I usually recommend a professional for transmission issues.
*   **Clutch Assembly:** Some washers have a clutch assembly for spinning. If the clutch pads wear out, the motor may hum without engaging the spin cycle properly. The motor receives power, but the clutch fails to transmit it. This creates a humming sound as the motor strains.

These components need to work in harmony. Any disruption can cause your Amana washer to make a humming noise. A thorough visual inspection is always the first step. Look for obvious signs of wear or damage.

### Water Inlet Valve Issues: A Potential Source of Noise

The water inlet valve is a crucial component in your Amana washer. It controls the flow of water into the tub. When this valve malfunctions, it often produces a distinct humming or buzzing sound. This noise typically happens when the washer attempts to fill with water. I hear this sound frequently in older machines.

#### How the Water Inlet Valve Works

The water inlet valve connects to both the hot and cold water supply lines. It has two or more solenoids, which are electromagnetic coils. When the washer's control board sends an electrical signal, the solenoids energize. This opens small plungers inside the valve. Water then flows into the tub through these open passages. The valve ensures the correct water temperature and amount for each cycle.

#### Identifying a Humming Inlet Valve

If your Amana washer makes a humming noise during the fill cycle, the water inlet valve is a likely suspect. The hum occurs because a solenoid is receiving power but cannot fully open or close. This might be due to several reasons:

*   **Weak Solenoid:** Over time, the solenoid coils can weaken. A weak solenoid struggles to pull the plunger open. It receives power and hums, but lacks the strength to operate correctly. This results in restricted water flow or no flow at all.
*   **Mineral Buildup:** Hard water can leave mineral deposits inside the valve. These deposits can restrict the movement of the plungers. The solenoid then hums as it tries to push against the obstruction. This is a very common problem in areas with hard water.
*   **Debris:** Small particles from the water supply can get trapped in the valve. Sand, rust, or sediment can block the valve's openings. The solenoid struggles to clear the blockage, causing a hum. This also reduces water pressure.
*   **Faulty Diaphragm:** Some valves use rubber diaphragms. If these diaphragms become stiff or torn, the valve may not seal properly. It might hum as it tries to regulate water flow.

#### Troubleshooting the Water Inlet Valve

1.  **Check Water Supply:** First, ensure both hot and cold water faucets are fully open. Low water pressure can sometimes cause the valve to hum as it struggles to fill.
2.  **Inspect Inlet Screens:** Turn off the water supply and disconnect the water hoses from the back of the washer. Inside the valve's hose connections, you will find small screens. These screens catch sediment. Clean any debris from these screens using a brush or pliers. I often find these clogged.
3.  **Listen to the Valve:** With the top cover off (if accessible and safe), try to start a fill cycle. Listen directly to the valve. If the hum is clearly coming from there, it points to a valve issue.
4.  **Consider Replacement:** If cleaning the screens does not resolve the hum, the valve likely needs replacement. It is usually sold as a complete unit. Replacing a water inlet valve is a common DIY repair. Make sure to buy the correct part for your Amana model.

Addressing a humming water inlet valve can restore proper water flow and eliminate annoying noises. This fix helps your washer run smoothly again. It prevents longer fill times and potentially damaged laundry.

### Drain Pump Troubles: When the Hum Means a Blockage

Your Amana washer relies on a fully functional drain pump to remove water after each wash and rinse cycle. If your washer starts making a humming noise specifically when it should be draining, the drain pump is a prime suspect. This hum often means the pump is trying to work but cannot. It is a common issue that I encounter frequently.

#### The Role of the Drain Pump

The drain pump's job is simple: push water out of the wash tub. It consists of an electric motor and an impeller. The motor spins the impeller, which creates suction and propels water through the drain hose. This action is critical for preventing standing water in the drum. It ensures proper spinning and drying of clothes.

#### Causes of a Humming Drain Pump

When an Amana washer makes a humming noise during the drain cycle, it usually points to one of two main problems with the drain pump:

*   **Obstruction:** This is the most common cause. Small items can bypass the filter and get lodged in the drain pump's impeller. Coins, buttons, socks, hairpins, or even pet hair can create a blockage. When the motor tries to spin the impeller, it encounters resistance. The motor still receives power, leading to a humming sound as it struggles. The pump cannot effectively move water out. I always check for foreign objects first.
*   **Failing Motor:** The drain pump's internal motor can wear out over time. Its bearings might seize, or the windings could fail. In this case, the motor receives power and hums, but it lacks the strength to turn the impeller. Even without a blockage, a failing motor will produce this sound. Eventually, it will stop working altogether.

#### Troubleshooting Your Drain Pump

1.  **Disconnect Power:** Always unplug the washer before starting any inspection or repair. This is essential for your safety.
2.  **Access the Drain Pump:** The drain pump's location varies by Amana model. It is typically at the bottom front or rear of the washer. You might need to tilt the washer back or remove a front access panel. Consult your owner's manual for specific access instructions.
3.  **Inspect for Blockages:**
    *   **Remove Hoses:** Disconnect the hoses leading to and from the drain pump. Be ready for residual water to spill out. Use a pan and towels.
    *   **Check Impeller:** Look inside the pump housing where the impeller is. Use a flashlight. Carefully remove any visible foreign objects. I often use pliers or tweezers for this.
    *   **Inspect Hoses:** Check the drain hose and the hose connecting the tub to the pump. Blockages can occur anywhere along the drain path. Clear any clogs you find.
4.  **Test the Pump:** If no blockage is found, the pump motor itself might be bad. With the pump accessible, you can try to start a drain cycle (briefly, with safety in mind). If the pump still hums but does not move water, it likely needs replacement. A technician can test the pump motor's electrical continuity.

Replacing a drain pump is a manageable DIY task for many. Ensure you purchase the correct OEM part for your Amana washer. This helps your machine drain correctly. It prevents future humming noises and potential water damage.

### Worn Bearings and Mechanical Components: The Loudest Hums

Sometimes, the humming sound from your Amana washer is not a soft buzz. It can be a loud, grinding hum. This usually points to issues with mechanical wear, specifically worn bearings. Bearings are critical parts that allow other components to rotate smoothly. When they fail, the noise is significant. I often associate a deep, consistent hum with worn bearings.

#### The Function of Bearings

Bearings support rotating shafts within your washer. They allow parts like the motor, transmission, and inner tub to spin with minimal friction. Common bearings include those in the motor itself and the main tub bearings. These bearings consist of small metal balls or rollers inside races. They are lubricated to ensure smooth movement.

#### Signs of Worn Bearings

If your Amana washer is making a loud humming noise, especially during the spin cycle, worn bearings are a strong possibility. Here are some indicators:

*   **Loud Hum or Growl:** The noise becomes louder and more prominent during faster spin speeds. It might sound like a jet engine or a loud grinding.
*   **Rough Spin:** The inner tub might feel rough when you try to turn it by hand. It may not spin freely.
*   **Vibration:** Excessive vibration accompanies the humming. The entire washer may shake.
*   **Water Leaks:** In the case of main tub bearings, a failed seal often precedes bearing failure. This can lead to water leaking from the bottom of the tub. The water then damages the bearings.

#### Other Mechanical Components

Besides bearings, other mechanical parts can cause a humming noise due to wear or friction:

*   **Motor Mounts:** The motor sits on rubber or plastic mounts. If these mounts degrade, the motor might vibrate excessively. This vibration can cause a humming or rattling noise. The mounts absorb motor vibrations.
*   **Suspension Rods/Springs:** These components support the washer tub. If they wear out, the tub can become unbalanced. An unbalanced tub can cause other parts to rub or strain. This friction can lead to a humming sound. The washer may also shake violently.
*   **Transmission Gaskets/Seals:** In some models, internal transmission components might develop leaks. This reduces lubrication and increases friction. The transmission can then hum or grind during operation. This is usually a job for a professional.

#### Diagnosing Worn Bearings and Mechanical Issues

1.  **Unplug the Washer:** Always disconnect power before inspecting internal components.
2.  **Access the Components:** You will likely need to remove the washer's outer panels to reach the motor, transmission, or tub bearings. This varies by model.
3.  **Inspect Motor Bearings:** If you suspect motor bearings, try to spin the motor shaft by hand (with the belt removed). It should turn smoothly. Any roughness or excessive play indicates worn bearings.
4.  **Check Tub Bearings:** With the washer empty, reach into the tub and try to lift the inner drum. There should be minimal play. Then, try to spin the inner tub by hand. It should turn quietly and smoothly. If you hear a grinding noise, the tub bearings are likely failing.
5.  **Examine Mounts and Rods:** Visually inspect the motor mounts and suspension rods. Look for cracks, breaks, or excessive wear.

Replacing tub bearings is a complex and time-consuming repair. It often requires significant disassembly of the washer. Many people choose to call a professional for this. Motor bearings can also be challenging. It might be more cost-effective to replace the entire motor if bearings fail. These repairs extend the life of your Amana washer. They also restore quiet operation.

### DIY Troubleshooting Steps for Your Amana Washer

Finding your Amana washer making a humming noise can be frustrating. Before you call a technician, there are several troubleshooting steps you can try. Many common issues have simple solutions. I always recommend these initial checks.

#### Step 1: Safety First - Disconnect Power

This step is critical. Always unplug your Amana washer from the electrical outlet. This prevents any risk of electrical shock. It ensures the machine cannot start accidentally while you are working on it. Never skip this step.

#### Step 2: Empty and Observe the Washer

Remove all clothes from the washer drum. An overloaded or unbalanced load can sometimes cause unusual noises. Close the lid or door. Then, plug the washer back in. Try running a very short cycle, like a quick rinse and spin. Listen carefully for when the humming occurs. Does it happen during filling, agitation, or spinning? Unplug the washer again after this test.

#### Step 3: Check Water Inlet and Drain Hoses

1.  **Water Inlet Hoses:**
    *   Turn off the hot and cold water supply to the washer at the wall.
    *   Disconnect the hoses from the back of the washer.
    *   Check the small mesh screens inside the hose connections on the washer's back. These screens prevent debris from entering the valve.
    *   Clean any accumulated sediment or rust from these screens. Use needle-nose pliers or a small brush.
    *   Reconnect the hoses and turn the water back on.
2.  **Drain Hose:**
    *   Inspect the drain hose that goes from the washer to your standpipe or utility sink.
    *   Look for kinks or blockages along its length.
    *   Ensure the hose is not pushed too far down into the standpipe. This can create a siphon effect and restrict drainage.
    *   If accessible, disconnect the drain hose from the washer's drain pump. Check for obstructions at the pump outlet.

#### Step 4: Inspect the Drain Pump Filter and Impeller

This is a common area for humming noises. The drain pump is usually located at the bottom front or back of the washer.

1.  **Access the Pump:** You may need to remove a lower access panel or tilt the washer back. Refer to your owner's manual for specific access.
2.  **Locate the Filter:** Many Amana washers have a small clean-out filter near the drain pump. Unscrew this filter (have a shallow pan and towels ready, as water will come out).
3.  **Clean the Filter:** Remove any lint, coins, buttons, or other debris.
4.  **Check Impeller:** With the filter removed, you might be able to see the pump's impeller blades. Carefully check for any objects caught in the impeller. You can use long-nose pliers or your fingers. Spin the impeller by hand. It should turn freely.
5.  **Reassemble:** Screw the filter back in firmly. Replace any access panels.

#### Step 5: Examine the Drive Belt and Pulleys (if applicable)

For belt-driven Amana models, a loose or damaged belt can cause a hum.

1.  **Access the Belt:** This usually involves removing the back or front panel of the washer.
2.  **Inspect the Belt:** Look for cracks, fraying, or signs of wear. Feel its tension. It should be snug but not overly tight.
3.  **Check Pulleys:** Rotate the pulleys by hand. They should turn smoothly without wobble.
4.  **Replace if Damaged:** If the belt is worn, replace it. If a pulley is seized or damaged, it also needs replacement.

#### Step 6: Listen for the Motor Hum

If all other checks reveal nothing, the motor itself could be causing the hum.

1.  **Access Motor:** You may need to remove panels to get close to the motor.
2.  **Listen Carefully:** With the washer briefly plugged in (for testing only, then immediately unplug), try to start a cycle. Pinpoint the motor if the hum comes directly from it.
3.  **Consider Professional Help:** A motor issue, especially involving internal parts or the capacitor, often requires a qualified technician.

These DIY steps can save you money and get your Amana washer back to quiet operation. Always prioritize safety during any repair attempt.

### When to Call a Professional: Knowing Your Limits
