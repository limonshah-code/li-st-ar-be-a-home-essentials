### Confirming Dates and Times

Award shows happen on specific dates. The red carpet coverage starts before the main ceremony. Always check the official schedule. You can find this on the award show's website or major entertainment news sites. Note down the start time for the pre-show in your local time zone.

I always set a reminder on my phone. This helps me catch the beginning of the red carpet. Different channels might start their coverage at slightly different times. E! often begins earlier than the network's official pre-show. Knowing these times is important for comprehensive viewing.

### Checking Local Channel Listings

Even with national networks, local channel numbers vary. Use your cable or satellite provider's guide. You can also visit their website. Confirm the channel number for ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, and E! in your area. This simple step prevents frantic searching at show time.

Sometimes, regional blackouts can affect live streams. I always double-check my local listings. This ensures I have the correct channel. This is especially true if you are using an antenna for broadcast TV. A quick check saves time and frustration.

If you plan to use a streaming service, make sure your subscription is active. Also, confirm the service includes the necessary channels. Some services have different tiers. You might need a specific package to access all major networks or E!. I always check my subscription details before the big day.

For example, a basic Sling TV package might not include every channel. Upgrading might be necessary. Also, ensure your internet connection is stable. A good connection prevents buffering during live events. This preparation makes your streaming experience enjoyable.

### Enhancing Your Red Carpet Viewing Experience
