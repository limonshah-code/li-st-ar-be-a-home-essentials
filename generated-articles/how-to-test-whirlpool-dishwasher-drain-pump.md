## How To Test Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Pump

Is your Whirlpool dishwasher leaving a puddle of water at the bottom after a wash cycle? This common problem often points to an issue with the drain pump. A faulty drain pump prevents water from exiting the appliance, causing frustration and a mess. I understand how essential a working dishwasher is for a smooth-running home.

Testing your Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump helps pinpoint the exact problem. This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions. We will cover identifying drain pump issues, preparing for the test, conducting electrical checks, and performing mechanical inspections. You will gain the confidence to diagnose your dishwasher drain problem effectively. Let's get your Whirlpool dishwasher back to draining properly.

### Takeaway

*   **Safety First:** Always disconnect power before starting any work on your dishwasher.
*   **Visual Inspection:** Check for visible clogs in the drain filter, spray arm, and drain hose.
*   **Listen for Sounds:** A humming sound without draining suggests a stuck impeller or obstruction.
*   **Electrical Test:** Use a multimeter to check for continuity and resistance (Ohms) at the pump terminals.
*   **Mechanical Test:** Inspect the impeller for damage and ensure it spins freely.

### Answer to the Main Query

To test a Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump, first disconnect power. Then, visually inspect for clogs in the filter, sump, and drain hose. Next, use a multimeter to check the pump motor's electrical continuity and Ohm resistance. Finally, physically inspect the impeller for obstructions or damage. These steps help determine if the pump is faulty or simply obstructed.

### Understanding Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Pump Function

The drain pump is a crucial component in your Whirlpool dishwasher. Its main job is to remove dirty water from the wash tub at specific points in the cycle. It activates during the draining phases, ensuring dishes rinse properly and finish clean. When the cycle ends, the pump ensures all water leaves the appliance.

The drain pump works with the control board and various sensors. The control board sends a signal to the pump when it is time to drain. The pump then uses a small motor to spin an impeller. This impeller creates suction, pulling water from the bottom of the dishwasher and pushing it through the drain hose. The water then goes into your home's drain system.

Understanding this process helps when you test Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump problems. If the pump does not get power, it will not spin. If the impeller is blocked, it cannot move water. Both scenarios result in standing water inside your dishwasher. Recognizing how the pump works helps you isolate the cause of a no-drain issue. This knowledge empowers you to find solutions.

Different factors can prevent the drain pump from working correctly. Sometimes, small food particles or debris get past the filter. These items can clog the pump's impeller or the drain hose. Other times, the pump's motor might fail electrically. The motor windings can burn out, or wiring connections can loosen. A faulty control board might also prevent the pump from receiving power. It is important to check multiple areas.

### Common Signs of a Failing Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Pump

Identifying the symptoms of a failing drain pump helps you confirm your suspicions. The most obvious sign is standing water in the bottom of your dishwasher after a cycle. This water might be dirty or even still soapy. If you open the dishwasher door and see water, your drain pump is likely not working correctly. This is a clear indicator to test Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump components.

Another common sign is unusual noises coming from the dishwasher during the drain cycle. You might hear a loud humming or buzzing sound, but no water actually drains. This noise often means the pump motor is trying to run but cannot. An obstruction, like a piece of glass or food debris, might be jamming the impeller. The motor strains against this blockage, creating the noise.

Sometimes, the dishwasher completes its cycle, but dishes come out dirty or with residue. This can happen if dirty water from a previous wash phase does not drain fully. The dirty water then recirculates during the rinse cycle. This leaves food particles or soap film on your dishes. It is a subtle sign, but still important.

Error codes on the dishwasher display can also point to drain pump issues. Whirlpool dishwashers have diagnostic systems. Specific codes indicate draining problems. Consult your dishwasher's user manual for a list of error codes. These codes provide a good starting point for troubleshooting. They can confirm whether the issue is related to draining.

If your dishwasher frequently stops mid-cycle, especially during a drain phase, this also indicates a problem. The machine might detect that water is not draining properly. It then pauses or shuts down to prevent overflow. These symptoms combined suggest it is time to perform a thorough test of your Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump system. Remember, a quick check can save you from a bigger repair later.

### Safety First: Preparing for Your Whirlpool Drain Pump Test

Before you start any work on your Whirlpool dishwasher, prioritize safety. Electricity and water do not mix, and you could get hurt if you are not careful. The very first step is to disconnect power to the dishwasher. You can do this in two ways. You can unplug the dishwasher if its power cord is accessible. Many dishwashers are hardwired, so you must turn off the circuit breaker. Find the circuit breaker panel in your home. Locate the breaker labeled for the kitchen or dishwasher and flip it to the "off" position. This stops electricity from reaching the appliance.

Next, you need to access the drain pump. The drain pump is usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher. You will likely need to pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet space. To do this, open the dishwasher door fully. Look for mounting screws that secure the dishwasher to the countertop or cabinet. These screws are usually located on the top sides of the dishwasher frame. Remove these screws. Gently pull the dishwasher forward. Be careful not to strain the water supply line or the drain hose. These lines are still connected at this stage.

You may need to lean the dishwasher onto its back or side for better access. This depends on the model. Before tilting it, place old towels or a shallow pan underneath. Some residual water might spill out from the drain hose or sump. Having towels ready prevents a mess. Also, have basic tools ready. A Phillips head screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, and pliers are often needed. A multi-meter is essential for electrical tests. Having everything organized makes the process smoother. Always confirm the power is off before touching any wires or components.

### Initial Checks: Addressing Simple Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Issues

Before you even touch a multimeter, perform some simple visual checks. Many drain problems are not caused by a faulty pump motor. Instead, they are due to easily fixed clogs. Start by looking inside the dishwasher tub. Remove the lower dish rack. Locate the drain filter at the bottom of the tub. This filter traps food particles. It prevents them from entering the drain pump. Remove the filter and inspect it. You might find food debris, broken glass, or even a bone. Clean the filter thoroughly under running water.

After checking the filter, inspect the sump area beneath it. This is where water collects before draining. Use a flashlight to look inside. You might see larger objects that bypassed the filter. Small utensils, broken plastic, or thick grease can block the impeller or the drain opening. Carefully remove any visible obstructions. Wear gloves to protect your hands from sharp objects. This basic cleaning can often solve your drainage issue. For more specific guidance on this, consider reading [How To Clean Dishwasher Filter and Drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-and-drain).

Next, examine the drain hose. This hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. Look for kinks or bends in the hose behind the dishwasher. A kinked hose restricts water flow. Straighten any visible kinks. The drain hose connects to a standpipe, a garbage disposal, or a sink drain air gap. Ensure these connections are not clogged. If connected to a garbage disposal, make sure the knockout plug was removed during installation. If it was not, water cannot drain through.

You can also try running a quick cycle after these initial checks. If the water still does not drain, the problem lies deeper. These initial checks address common problems that mimic a failing drain pump. Clearing these simple blockages saves you time and effort. If the issue persists, then you move on to testing the pump directly. Learning [How To Get The Dishwasher To Drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain) provides more comprehensive information on general drain issues.

### Testing the Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Pump: Electrical Tests

Once you have performed the initial visual checks and ensured safety, it's time for electrical tests. These tests use a multimeter to check the continuity and resistance of the drain pump motor. This helps determine if the motor is receiving power or if its internal windings are faulty. You need to access the drain pump and its wiring connections.

First, locate the drain pump on your Whirlpool dishwasher. It is typically at the bottom, near the front. You might need to remove the lower access panel or tilt the dishwasher back. Once you find the pump, identify the electrical wires connecting to it. There will usually be two wires leading to the pump motor. Carefully disconnect these wires from the pump terminals. You might need to use pliers to gently pull them off. Make sure you remember or mark which wire goes to which terminal if they are not identical.

Set your multimeter to the Ohms (Ω) setting, specifically for continuity or resistance. Place one probe on each terminal of the drain pump motor. If the pump is working correctly, you should get a resistance reading. This reading typically falls within a specific range, often between 10 to 20 Ohms for a Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump. A reading of "0" Ohms or very close to zero indicates a short circuit. An "OL" (overload) or infinity reading indicates an open circuit. Both "0" and "OL" readings suggest a faulty motor winding inside the pump. This means the pump needs replacement. For more details on what values to expect, refer to [How Many Ohms Should A Dishwasher Drain Pump Have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-many-ohms-should-a-dishwasher-drain-pump-have).

Next, check for continuity. While still on the Ohms setting, or a dedicated continuity setting if your multimeter has one, touch the probes to the terminals. The multimeter should beep or show a reading that confirms a closed circuit. No beep or an "OL" reading means there is no continuity. This confirms the circuit is broken, and the pump motor is likely bad. If the electrical tests show good continuity and the correct Ohm reading, the pump motor itself is likely fine. The problem might then be with the control board or wiring leading to the pump. In that case, you might need to test the control board, perhaps like [How To Test Whirlpool Dishwasher Control Board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-whirlpool-dishwasher-control-board).

### Testing the Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Pump: Mechanical Inspection

After completing the electrical tests, it is time to perform a mechanical inspection of the drain pump. Even if the motor receives power, a mechanical issue can prevent water from draining. This inspection focuses on the physical parts of the pump. It helps find blockages or damaged components.

First, ensure the power is still disconnected from the dishwasher. Locate the drain pump again. You might need to remove mounting screws that hold the pump in place. Carefully detach the pump from the dishwasher sump housing. This may involve twisting it counter-clockwise or unlatching clips, depending on your Whirlpool model. Have a towel ready, as some residual water might spill out.

Once the pump is free, inspect the impeller. The impeller is a small, fan-like component inside the pump housing. It spins to push water out. Check for any visible obstructions caught in the impeller blades. Common culprits include small pieces of broken glass, food debris, paper labels, or even hair. Carefully remove any foreign objects you find. You can use needle-nose pliers or tweezers for this task. Ensure all blades are clear and free from damage.

Next, try to spin the impeller manually. It should spin freely with minimal resistance. If it feels stiff, grinds, or does not move at all, something is wrong. The motor shaft might be seized, or an internal bearing could be failing. Sometimes, debris gets lodged behind the impeller, where you cannot easily see it. If the impeller does not spin freely, the pump cannot move water. Even a perfectly fine motor will fail to drain if its impeller is jammed.

Also, examine the pump housing for cracks or damage. Although rare, a cracked housing can cause leaks or prevent proper suction. Check the rubber gasket or seal where the pump connects to the sump. A damaged or improperly seated gasket can lead to leaks rather than drainage. If you find any significant mechanical damage, especially to the impeller or housing, the pump needs replacement. A pump that passes electrical tests but fails mechanical inspection is still a faulty pump. Ensuring the entire drain system is clear, including learning [How To Clean Dishwasher Drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain), helps with complete troubleshooting.

### What to Do After Testing: Repair or Replace Your Whirlpool Drain Pump

After you have completed both the electrical and mechanical tests, you should have a clear diagnosis. If the drain pump motor showed no continuity or incorrect Ohm readings, the motor windings are bad. This means the pump is electrically faulty. If the impeller was jammed, broken, or did not spin freely, the pump has a mechanical failure. In either of these scenarios, your Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump needs to be replaced. Repairing a drain pump motor or its internal components is generally not practical. New pump assemblies are often sealed units.

To replace the drain pump, you will need to purchase a new one. Make sure you get the correct part number for your specific Whirlpool dishwasher model. You can usually find the model number on a label inside the dishwasher door. Once you have the new pump, the installation process is the reverse of removal. Disconnect the old pump from its electrical wires and mounting. Connect the new pump, ensuring all connections are secure. Reattach the electrical wires correctly. This ensures the pump gets power.

Before reinstalling the dishwasher fully, run a test cycle. Push the dishwasher back slightly so you can access the power and observe. Reconnect the power. Start a short wash cycle, or a drain-only cycle if your model has one. Observe if the water drains properly. Check for any leaks around the pump connections. If water drains, and there are no leaks, you have successfully replaced the pump.

If the pump passed all tests (electrical and mechanical), then the problem lies elsewhere. The issue might be with the dishwasher's control board. The control board sends power to the pump. If it fails, the pump never gets the signal to run. You would need to test the control board itself or consult a professional. Sometimes, the problem is a persistent clog further down the drain line that the pump cannot push past. This would require clearing your home's plumbing. Most of the time, though, testing the Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump directly will reveal the true culprit, allowing you to get your appliance working again.

### Troubleshooting Persistent Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Issues

Even after testing or replacing the drain pump, you might still face drainage issues. Do not get discouraged; some problems are more stubborn. If your Whirlpool dishwasher still does not drain, consider external factors. One common culprit is your home's plumbing. The dishwasher drains into your sink's drain pipe or a garbage disposal. A clog in these areas will prevent your dishwasher from draining properly, even with a new pump.

To check your sink drain, fill the sink with water and then pull the stopper. Observe if the water drains quickly. If it drains slowly or not at all, you have a clog in your sink plumbing. This clog must be cleared first. If you have a garbage disposal, run it for about 30 seconds with water. Food particles can sometimes accumulate inside the disposal, blocking the dishwasher drain connection. Ensure the knockout plug for the dishwasher drain line was correctly removed during disposal installation if it is new.

Another area to check is the air gap, if your local plumbing code requires one. This is a small cylindrical device usually located on your sink countertop, near the faucet. Water from the dishwasher drain hose routes through this air gap before going into the sink drain. Air gaps can become clogged with food particles. Unscrew the cap of the air gap and remove any visible debris. Cleaning this can often resolve draining problems.

Sometimes, the drain hose itself develops an internal blockage or gets constricted. Even if it looks clear from the outside, old grease and food sludge can build up inside. You may need to disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink/disposal. Then, thoroughly clean it out. You can use a long brush or even flush it with water. If it is old and very stiff or damaged, replacing the drain hose might be the best option. [How To Clean Dishwasher Pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-pump) also gives insight into maintenance that can prevent some of these issues. Persistent issues might require a licensed plumber if you have ruled out all dishwasher components.

### Preventing Future Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Pump Problems

Once you have successfully fixed your Whirlpool dishwasher's draining issue, you want to prevent it from happening again. Regular maintenance is the key to a long-lasting drain pump and a smoothly operating dishwasher. I find that prevention is always easier than repair.

First, always scrape large food particles off your dishes before loading them. While your dishwasher has a filter, it is designed to catch small debris, not large chunks of food. Large particles like chicken bones, fruit pits, or excessive grease can easily overwhelm the filter and clog the drain pump. Pre-rinsing is not necessary, but scraping is important.

Second, regularly clean your dishwasher's filter. This is perhaps the most important maintenance step. Most Whirlpool dishwashers have a removable filter at the bottom of the tub. Consult your manual for exact instructions, but generally, you twist and lift it out. Rinse it under warm running water to remove trapped food and grease. You can use an old toothbrush to gently scrub the mesh. I recommend doing this at least once a month, or more often if you use your dishwasher heavily.

Third, occasionally run a hot wash cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or white vinegar. This helps break down grease and mineral deposits that can build up in the drain system and pump. Add a cup of white vinegar to an empty dishwasher and run a hot cycle. Alternatively, place a dishwasher cleaner tablet in the detergent dispenser. These cleaners help flush out accumulated grime.

Fourth, check your drain hose periodically for kinks or blockages. Behind the dishwasher, the hose can sometimes get pinched or bent if the appliance is moved. Ensure it has a smooth path to the drain connection. If you have a garbage disposal, run it regularly, even if you are not using the sink. This helps prevent food accumulation at the drain connection point that serves the dishwasher. Following these simple practices will significantly extend the life of your Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump and keep your dishes sparkling clean.
