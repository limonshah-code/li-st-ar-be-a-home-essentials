When a company like Bosch, known for its quality, announces a recall, it is important to pay attention. This article will help you understand **what Bosch dishwashers are being recalled**. We will explain why these recalls happen and what you need to do if your dishwasher is affected. My goal is to give you clear steps to ensure your home remains safe.

Certain Bosch dishwashers have been recalled because of a power cord issue. This defect can cause the cord to overheat, posing a fire hazard.

## Identifying Recalled Bosch Dishwasher Models

You might be wondering which specific **Bosch dishwashers are being recalled**. It is crucial to identify your model to know if it is part of this recall. The recall affects dishwashers sold under the Bosch, Thermador, Gaggenau, and Kenmore brands. These units were sold in various retail stores across the United States.

The primary issue involves the power cord. This cord can overheat, creating a risk of fire. It is important to know the specific model series and production date to determine if your unit is affected. This information helps you confirm your dishwasher's status.

Here are the specific model series included in the recall:

*   **Bosch:** SHE4T, SHE5T, SHE6T, SHX4T, SHX5T, SHX6T, SPE5T
*   **Thermador:** DWHD, DWHC, DWMC
*   **Gaggenau:** DF241, DF261
*   **Kenmore:** 587.xxxxxxx (Specific model number patterns)

To find your model and serial number, open your dishwasher door. Look on the top of the door frame or on the side of the door. The label typically has this information. The recall primarily covers units manufactured from January 2008 through December 2013. You can usually find the manufacturing date code as part of the serial number. Checking this detail is your first step in ensuring safety. Knowing your dishwasher's exact model number is also helpful when you are comparing different Bosch dishwashers, such as when deciding [which Bosch dishwasher is the best](https://homeessentialsguide.com/which-bosch-dishwasher-is-the-best) for your needs.

## The Reason Behind the Bosch Dishwasher Recall

The core reason for the **Bosch dishwasher recall** centers on a critical safety defect. This defect involves the power supply cord. Over time, or under certain conditions, this cord can overheat. This overheating poses a significant fire hazard.

Manufacturers issue recalls to protect consumers from potential harm. In this case, the risk of fire is serious. Electrical issues in appliances, especially those that use water, need immediate attention. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) worked with Bosch (BSH Home Appliances Corporation) to announce this recall. This action aims to prevent injuries or property damage.

The problem specifically relates to the power cord, not other internal components. For example, it is not an issue with how the dishwasher heats its own water, as many modern Bosch dishwashers do. You can learn more about this feature if you're curious about [does Bosch dishwasher heat its own water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-bosch-dishwasher-heat-its-own-water). The focus of this recall is purely on the external power connection. A faulty power cord can lead to melted plastic, smoke, or even open flames. This makes it vital to check your unit. We want to ensure no one experiences a dangerous situation. Your safety in your home is always the top priority.

## How to Check if Your Bosch Dishwasher Is Affected

Determining if your **Bosch dishwasher is affected by the recall** is straightforward. You will need to find the model and serial numbers on your appliance. These numbers are unique to your unit. They help you check against the official recall list.

Follow these simple steps to check your dishwasher:

1.  **Locate the Information Label:** Open your dishwasher door fully. Look for a label on the top edge of the inner door, or along the side edge of the dishwasher tub. This label contains important information.
2.  **Find Model and Serial Numbers:** On the label, you will see a "Model Number" (often starts with SHE, SHX, DWHD, etc.) and a "Serial Number." The serial number includes a date code. This code indicates when your dishwasher was made.
3.  **Check the Date Code:** For Bosch, Thermador, and Gaggenau, the production date code is typically the first four digits of the serial number. For Kenmore, it's often the last four digits of the serial number. You are looking for a date code between January 2008 and December 2013. For example, a serial number starting with 8801 means January 2008. A serial number starting with 9312 means December 2013.
4.  **Use the Official Recall Website:** Visit the official BSH Home Appliances recall website or the CPSC website. They usually have a tool or a clear list. You can enter your model and serial number there. This tool will confirm if your specific dishwasher is part of the recall.

It is important to be precise when entering these numbers. A single mistake can give you an incorrect result. Do not hesitate to contact Bosch customer service directly if you have any trouble finding the information. They are there to help guide you through the process. Keeping your appliances in good order helps ensure your home is safe. This also applies to general maintenance, such as understanding if [do dishwashers have water heaters](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-dishwashers-have-water-heaters) and how those components might impact overall appliance health.

## Understanding Product Recalls and Consumer Safety

Product recalls, like the one for **Bosch dishwashers**, are a vital part of consumer safety. They happen when a product is found to have a defect or poses a risk to users. The purpose of a recall is to remove dangerous products from the market. It also aims to fix existing ones to prevent harm.

Government agencies often oversee recalls. In the United States, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is the main body. The CPSC works with manufacturers. They ensure that dangerous products are identified and addressed. They issue alerts and help companies inform the public. Their goal is to protect people from injuries or deaths linked to consumer products.

Companies initiate recalls for various reasons. Sometimes, it is due to a design flaw. Other times, it is a manufacturing error. The power cord issue in the Bosch dishwashers falls into this category. It is a critical component that, when defective, creates a significant hazard. It is essential for consumers to stay informed about potential recalls. Registering your appliances can help you receive direct notifications. This proactive step ensures you are aware of safety updates. Also, knowing what detergent is [recommended for Bosch dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-detergent-is-recommended-for-bosch-dishwasher) can contribute to its safe and efficient operation, reducing strain on its systems.

Regular maintenance and careful use extend the life of your appliances. It also keeps your home safe. I always make sure to take proactive steps with my home appliances.

*   **Address Issues Promptly:** If you notice anything unusual with an appliance, like strange noises, smells, or performance issues, address it immediately. Do not ignore warning signs. Contact a qualified technician for repairs. Prompt attention can prevent minor problems from becoming major safety risks.

## The Broader Impact of Recalls on Appliance Availability

When **Bosch dishwashers are recalled**, it can have ripple effects beyond immediate safety concerns. One such effect is on product availability. Recalls mean that a certain batch or series of products must be pulled from sales. This can lead to temporary shortages in the market. If many units are recalled, it might affect how readily consumers can purchase new Bosch dishwashers.

Manufacturers must stop selling the affected models. They also need to process returns or repairs for units already sold. This massive logistical effort can slow down production for other models. Sometimes, factories might retool or adjust their processes to prevent similar issues. This is a good thing for long-term safety, but it can impact short-term supply.

Consumers looking to buy a new Bosch dishwasher might experience longer wait times. They might find fewer options available. This is especially true if the recall was extensive. It underscores the importance of supply chain management for appliance companies. While inconvenient for consumers, these measures are necessary. They prioritize safety over sales volume. Understanding this aspect can shed light on why, at times, you might ask yourself, "[Are Bosch dishwashers available now?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/are-bosch-dishwashers-available-now)" The answer can sometimes be influenced by past recalls and ongoing production adjustments. The goal is always to deliver safe, reliable products to customers.
