*   **Consider professional repair:** For control board or motor issues, call a technician.

Your Whirlpool washing machine typically gets stuck on "Sensing" due to issues like an unbalanced load, a faulty lid switch, water supply problems, or a glitch in the control board. Resolving these common issues often involves simple checks or a quick power cycle reset.

## Understanding the Sensing Cycle on Your Whirlpool Washer

Modern Whirlpool washing machines are designed with advanced features. One such feature is the "Sensing" cycle. This cycle is very important for efficient operation.

During the "Sensing" phase, your washer takes time to assess the load inside. It determines the weight and type of fabric. This helps the machine choose the correct water level and agitation intensity. This process ensures optimal cleaning performance and water conservation. If this cycle cannot complete, your wash will not start.

Many factors can interfere with this initial assessment. An issue here will cause the machine to halt. It will display "Sensing" indefinitely. Understanding this cycle helps in troubleshooting.

### How the Sensing Cycle Works

The sensing cycle is the first step in most modern wash programs. Your Whirlpool washer uses sensors to measure different parameters. It checks the weight of the clothes. It also assesses how much water the clothes can absorb.

The machine might briefly tumble the clothes during this phase. This action helps distribute the load evenly. It also allows the sensors to get an accurate reading. Once done, the washer knows exactly what resources it needs for the wash.

This clever system saves water and energy. It prevents overflowing or using too little water. When it fails, the machine cannot proceed.

### Why the Sensing Cycle Is Important

The sensing cycle is not just a fancy feature. It is crucial for proper washing. Without an accurate assessment, your machine might use too much water. This wastes resources and can reduce cleaning effectiveness. Conversely, too little water can harm your clothes.

It also protects the machine itself. Overloading a machine without proper sensing can damage internal components. The sensing cycle ensures the machine runs safely and efficiently. If your Whirlpool washing machine is stuck on sensing, you cannot start any wash program.

This cycle ensures a gentle yet effective wash. It adapts to different load sizes. This customization helps your clothes last longer. Proper sensing prevents wear and tear on fabrics.

## Power Cycle Resetting Your Whirlpool Washer

Often, the simplest solution is the most effective. A power cycle reset can resolve many electronic glitches. This applies to your Whirlpool washing machine too. It is the first step to try when your washer gets stuck.

This action clears temporary errors in the machine's memory. It is like restarting a computer. It can fix minor software bugs. I always start with this step.

### How to Perform a Power Reset

Performing a power reset is easy. First, turn off your washing machine. Do this by pressing the "Power" button. Next, unplug the washer from the wall outlet. Wait for at least one to two minutes. This waiting period is important. It allows the electrical charge to drain completely.

After waiting, plug the washing machine back in. Make sure the outlet has power. Then, turn the machine on. Try to start a new wash cycle. See if the "Sensing" issue persists. For specific instructions on resetting your machine, you can check out [how to reset Whirlpool washing machine after power outage](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-whirlpool-washing-machine-after-power-outage). This can often clear the error.

This simple reset often solves the problem. It costs nothing and takes little time. I have used this method many times. It works for many household appliances.

### When to Use a Power Reset

You should always try a power reset first. This applies to any mysterious behavior from your washer. It is especially useful if the machine was recently moved. It also helps after a power surge or outage.

If the "Sensing" problem appeared suddenly, try a reset. It is a quick diagnostic step. It can save you time and money. If the issue remains, then you can move to other troubleshooting steps. This also applies if your [Whirlpool washing machine is not turning on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-whirlpool-washing-machine-not-turning-on) at all.

This step is a good starting point for various issues. It helps rule out minor electronic glitches. A simple reset is often all that is needed.

## Checking Load Balance and Size

An unbalanced or overloaded drum is a very common reason for a Whirlpool washing machine to get stuck on "Sensing." Modern washers are sensitive to how clothes are distributed. They need the load to be just right to proceed. I have found this to be a frequent culprit.

If the machine senses too much weight, it might not proceed. Similarly, if clothes are bunched up on one side, it creates an imbalance. This imbalance prevents the washer from starting. The machine detects this unevenness during the sensing phase. It stops to protect itself from damage.

### Overloading Your Washing Machine

Overloading is a big mistake. Filling the drum too full can cause problems. Your Whirlpool washer needs space for clothes to move freely. This movement is part of the sensing process. When the drum is too full, clothes cannot tumble or absorb water correctly.

The machine's sensors detect this overcapacity. It might then get stuck on "Sensing." It simply cannot get an accurate reading. Always check your machine's capacity guidelines. Distribute clothes loosely inside the drum. Leave enough room for the laundry to move.

I often remind myself not to stuff the machine. It is better to do two smaller loads. This protects my machine and cleans clothes better. Overloading also strains the motor over time.

### Unbalanced Loads and How to Fix Them

An unbalanced load happens when clothes clump together. Heavy items like towels or jeans can shift to one side. This causes the drum to be unevenly weighted. During the sensing cycle, the machine might try to rebalance the load. It does this by slowly rotating the drum.

If it cannot rebalance, it will stop. It will then remain stuck on "Sensing." To fix this, open the lid. Manually redistribute the clothes. Spread them out evenly around the agitator or impeller. Close the lid and restart the cycle.

Sometimes, just adding a few smaller items can balance a load. For example, if you are washing one heavy blanket, add a few towels. This helps distribute the weight. This simple trick often solves the problem.

### The Importance of Load Distribution

Proper load distribution is key to smooth operation. It allows the machine to sense correctly. It also prevents excessive vibration during the spin cycle. When the load is balanced, your washer runs quietly. It also works more efficiently.

Ignoring load balance can damage your washing machine. It can wear out bearings or suspension components over time. This leads to costly repairs. A little care in loading saves headaches later. Pay attention to how you put clothes in. This prevents your Whirlpool washing machine from getting stuck on sensing.

## Inspecting the Lid Switch or Lid Lock Assembly

The lid switch or lid lock assembly is a critical safety feature. It prevents the washing machine from operating with an open lid. If this component is faulty, your Whirlpool washing machine might get stuck on "Sensing." The machine thinks the lid is open, even when it is closed. This prevents any cycle from starting.

I have seen many cases where this simple part caused big problems. It is a common wear-and-tear item. When it fails, the machine cannot proceed. The lid must be properly detected as closed and locked.

### What Does the Lid Switch Do?

The lid switch sends a signal to the main control board. This signal tells the machine whether the lid is closed. In newer models, a lid lock also engages. This mechanism locks the lid during certain cycles, like spin. This ensures safety.

If the switch is broken or misaligned, the signal is incorrect. The machine gets confused. It might not even know the lid is closed. Thus, it stops the cycle. It gets stuck on "Sensing" because it cannot detect a safe operating state. No water will enter. No agitation will occur.

This safety feature is non-negotiable for the machine. It will not operate without confirmation. A faulty lid switch is a frequent culprit.

### How to Check the Lid Switch/Lock

Checking the lid switch often requires some careful inspection. First, unplug the washer for safety. Look at the lid and the area where it meets the machine's frame. You might see a small plastic tab on the lid. This tab usually engages with the switch on the machine body.

Inspect for any visible damage. Look for cracks or bending on the tab or the switch mechanism. Try manually pressing the switch with your finger or a pen. You should hear a click. If there is no click, the switch might be faulty.

Sometimes, simply cleaning the area can help. Dust or detergent buildup can block the sensor. Ensure the lid closes firmly. Sometimes, the latch itself needs adjustment.

### Replacing a Faulty Lid Switch/Lock

If you determine the lid switch or lock is faulty, it needs replacement. This task can be a DIY project for some. It involves opening the top panel of the washer. You will need to disconnect the old switch and install a new one. Ensure you use the correct part number for your Whirlpool model.

For those unsure about electrical work, calling a professional is wise. This ensures safety and proper installation. However, it is a common repair. Many online guides can walk you through it. This fix often solves the "Sensing" problem immediately.

Consider a professional if you are uncomfortable. This part ensures your Whirlpool washing machine operates safely. A working lid switch is essential.

## Water Supply Issues and Inlet Valve Problems

Adequate water supply is essential for any washing machine cycle. If your Whirlpool washing machine is stuck on "Sensing," it could be due to water supply problems. The machine needs to fill with water to properly sense the load. If it cannot get enough water, it will pause the cycle. This often manifests as being stuck on "Sensing."

I have learned that even minor water flow issues can cause this. This is true whether your [Whirlpool washing machine is not filling with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-washing-machine-fill-up-with-water) at all, or if it fills slowly. The machine has sensors to detect water levels. If these sensors do not register water, the cycle will not advance.

### Checking Water Hoses and Faucets

Start by checking the hot and cold water supply hoses. Make sure they are not kinked. Kinks restrict water flow. Also, ensure both hot and cold water faucets are fully open. Sometimes, a valve might be partially closed. This reduces water pressure.

A low water pressure can also cause sensing issues. The machine expects a certain fill rate. If the rate is too slow, it waits indefinitely. Make sure your household water pressure is sufficient. You can test this by running a faucet nearby.

If hoses are old, they might be clogged internally. Replacing old hoses can be a good idea. This ensures good water flow. This simple check can save you from complex repairs.

### Inspecting Water Inlet Valve Screens

At the back of your Whirlpool washer, where the water hoses connect, there are small screens. These are filters for the water inlet valve. Over time, sediment and debris can accumulate on these screens. This blockage significantly reduces water flow.

Unplug the washer and turn off water supply to the machine. Disconnect the hoses. Use a pair of pliers or tweezers to carefully pull out the screens. Clean them under running water. You can use a small brush to remove stubborn debris. If they are heavily clogged or damaged, replace them.

Dirty inlet screens are a common problem. They are often overlooked. Cleaning them can immediately fix water fill issues. This allows the sensing cycle to complete. For a more involved fix, you can explore [how to replace Whirlpool washing machine water inlet valve](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-whirlpool-washing-machine-water-inlet-valve).

### Faulty Water Inlet Valve

If water supply and screen checks do not solve the problem, the water inlet valve itself might be faulty. This valve controls water flow into the washer. It is an electromagnetic valve. It opens and closes based on signals from the control board.

If the valve is stuck closed or only partially opens, water cannot enter. The machine waits for water to fill during sensing. A faulty valve will prevent this. You might hear a buzzing sound from the valve that stops after a few seconds. This indicates it is trying to open but cannot.

Replacing the water inlet valve often requires professional help. It involves accessing internal components. This part can wear out over time. A professional can diagnose and replace it safely.

## Pressure Switch and Air Dome Tube Issues

The pressure switch is a vital component in your Whirlpool washing machine. It measures the water level inside the tub. It does this by sensing air pressure in a connected tube. This tube is called the air dome tube. If either the pressure switch or the tube has a problem, your washer can get stuck on "Sensing." The machine cannot determine how much water is present.

I learned that this system works on very basic physics. As water fills the tub, it traps air in the tube. This air pressure is then read by the switch. An accurate reading is essential for the sensing cycle.

### How the Pressure Switch Works

The pressure switch is usually a small, round component. It has a tiny hose connected to it. This hose runs down to the bottom of the wash tub. As water fills the tub, it compresses the air in this hose. The pressure switch detects this air pressure change.

Based on the pressure, the switch sends a signal to the control board. This signal tells the board how much water is in the tub. The control board then knows when to stop filling. It also uses this information for the sensing cycle. If the switch malfunctions, it sends incorrect signals. This causes the washer to get stuck.

It is a simple but critical part. If it fails, the machine's water level detection fails.

### Inspecting the Air Dome Tube

The air dome tube can become clogged or kinked. Lint, soap residue, or even small foreign objects can block it. This blockage prevents air pressure from reaching the switch. Even a small kink can cause issues. The machine will not get an accurate water level reading.

To inspect, first unplug the washer. Locate the pressure switch. Carefully disconnect the air dome tube from it. Blow through the tube to check for blockages. You should feel air passing freely. If it is clogged, try to clear it. You might need to detach the other end from the tub. Be gentle to avoid damaging it.

If the tube has holes or cracks, it leaks air. This also prevents proper pressure reading. In such cases, the tube needs replacement. A clear, intact air dome tube is essential for proper sensing.

### Troubleshooting the Pressure Switch

Troubleshooting the pressure switch itself is harder for a DIY person. It requires a multimeter to test continuity. If you suspect the pressure switch is faulty, a professional can confirm. They can test its function accurately.

A faulty pressure switch might constantly indicate an empty tub. Or, it might show a full tub when it is not. Either way, it sends false information. This prevents the machine from advancing. This part is relatively inexpensive to replace. However, installation can be tricky.

Ensure the tube is clear and properly connected first. Often, a clogged tube is the real problem. A clean and clear tube supports proper pressure switch function.

## Agitator or Impeller Issues

For top-loading Whirlpool washing machines, the agitator or impeller plays a key role. It is involved in moving clothes. This movement is part of the sensing cycle. If the agitator or impeller does not move freely, it can prevent the machine from sensing correctly. The machine might get stuck on "Sensing" if it cannot properly tumble the clothes to assess the load.

I once found a sock wrapped around the agitator shaft. This small item was enough to interfere with sensing. It's often simple things that cause these issues. The machine needs everything to spin freely.

### The Role of Agitator/Impeller in Sensing

During the sensing cycle, the agitator or impeller might rotate briefly. This action helps redistribute the laundry. It allows the sensors to get an accurate reading of the load size and type. If the agitator cannot move, the machine cannot perform this step. It will then stop.

Problems with the agitator or impeller can be mechanical. Clothes could be wrapped around it. Foreign objects could be lodged beneath it. The drive system itself might have an issue. Any of these can prevent proper movement.

A stuck or slow agitator leads to a sensing failure. The machine waits for an expected movement. When it does not happen, it holds.

### What to Check

First, unplug your washing machine. Then, carefully inspect the agitator or impeller. Look for any clothing items. Check for small objects that might have fallen into the tub. Coins, socks, or small toys can get stuck. These objects can jam the movement.

Try to manually turn the agitator or impeller. It should have some free movement. If it feels stiff or completely stuck, something is likely obstructing it. You might need to remove the agitator cap. This allows for a deeper inspection. Some agitators are held by a bolt.

Ensure the agitator is sitting correctly. If it is loose, it might not engage with the drive shaft. This prevents proper movement. A loose agitator will also cause sensing issues.

### Potential Mechanical Problems

If no foreign objects are visible, the problem might be internal. The splines on the agitator could be stripped. The drive block or transmission might be faulty. These issues are more complex. They often require professional repair.

A worn drive block will prevent the agitator from spinning. A faulty transmission means the motor cannot transfer power. These problems mean the agitator cannot move properly. The machine cannot complete its sensing test. It will then remain stuck.

These internal mechanical issues are less common. But they are possible reasons. If you rule out simpler causes, consider these.

## Control Board Malfunction

The control board is the brain of your Whirlpool washing machine. It manages all functions, including the sensing cycle. If the control board malfunctions, it can send incorrect signals. It might fail to process sensor inputs. This can lead to the machine getting stuck on "Sensing" indefinitely. This is often a last resort diagnosis.

I know how frustrating it is when the brain of the machine fails. All other parts might be fine. But a bad control board stops everything. It is a complex electronic component.

### How the Control Board Influences Sensing

The control board receives data from various sensors. These include the water level sensor, lid switch, and motor speed sensor. It processes this data to determine the correct cycle parameters. It then sends commands to components like the water inlet valve and motor.

If the board has a software glitch or a hardware fault, it fails this process. It might not correctly interpret the sensor signals. It might not send the command to advance the cycle. This leaves the machine in a permanent "Sensing" loop. You might also see your [Whirlpool washing machine blinking all the lights](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-whirlpool-washing-machine-blinking-all-the-lights) if the control board is acting up.

A faulty board cannot direct the machine. It becomes unresponsive. This leads to the cycle not moving forward.

### Signs of a Faulty Control Board

Diagnosing a faulty control board is difficult. There are a few signs that might point to it. The machine might exhibit erratic behavior. Lights might flicker. Buttons might not respond correctly. Sometimes, specific error codes appear. These codes can indicate a control board problem.

If all other troubleshooting steps fail, the control board is a possibility. This is especially true if the problem is intermittent. A board that is slowly failing might work sometimes. Other times, it gets stuck.

This is not a common failure for newer machines. But it happens with older ones. Electronic components can degrade.

### When to Call a Professional

Replacing a control board is not a DIY task for most people. It involves working with sensitive electronics. It requires proper wiring and programming knowledge. Incorrect installation can damage the machine further. It can also pose electrical hazards.

If you suspect a control board issue, call a qualified appliance technician. They have the tools and expertise to diagnose it. They can confirm if the board is indeed the problem. They can also safely replace it. Control boards can be expensive. Get a professional opinion before replacing one.

A professional can accurately test all components. They ensure you do not replace parts unnecessarily. This saves money and time. This is the safest way to address a faulty control board.

## Checking for Error Codes

Modern Whirlpool washing machines often display error codes. These codes are very helpful. They indicate specific problems the machine detects. If your Whirlpool washing machine is stuck on "Sensing," check for any flashing lights or codes. These codes provide direct clues.

I always recommend consulting the user manual first. It lists all error codes. It also explains what each code means. This can save a lot of guesswork. The manual also often provides troubleshooting steps for each code.

### How to Check for Error Codes

Most Whirlpool washers display error codes on their digital screen. If your machine has no screen, it might use flashing lights. A specific sequence of lights can indicate a code. For example, the "Wash" light might flash twice, followed by the "Rinse" light once. This signifies a specific code.

Refer to your washer's user manual for details. It will have a section dedicated to error codes. It explains how to interpret them. Some models might require a specific button sequence to reveal codes. Pressing and holding certain buttons can trigger a diagnostic mode.

If you see a code, write it down. Then, look it up in your manual. This immediate action can guide your repair efforts.

### Common Error Codes Related to Sensing Issues

While error codes vary by model, some point to sensing-related problems. For example, codes related to water fill issues are common. An "F8 E1" or "LF" code often indicates long fill time. This means the machine is not getting enough water. This directly affects the sensing cycle.

Codes related to lid lock or door switch malfunctions are also relevant. An "Lid" or "dL" code points to this problem. The machine will not start if it thinks the lid is open. If you have a problem with water, checking [why won't my Whirlpool washing machine fill up with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-washing-machine-fill-up-with-water) might offer more specific guidance.

Other codes might indicate communication issues between parts. These sometimes point to a control board problem. Always cross-reference the code with your specific model's manual.

### Using Error Codes for Troubleshooting

Once you identify an error code, the troubleshooting becomes targeted. The manual will suggest specific checks or repairs. For a water fill error, you would check hoses, water pressure, and inlet screens. For a lid lock error, you would inspect the lid switch assembly.

Error codes streamline the diagnostic process. They tell you exactly where to focus your efforts. This prevents you from randomly checking components. It saves time and prevents unnecessary repairs. Use error codes as your guide. They are invaluable tools.

If the error code points to a complex issue, call a professional. For example, internal component failures often require expert repair. Do not attempt repairs beyond your skill level.
