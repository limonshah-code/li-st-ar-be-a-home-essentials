## Will a 9x12 Ruggable Fit in Your Washing Machine?

Ruggable rugs offer a great solution for busy homes. They are known for being machine washable. You might wonder, "Will a 9x12 Ruggable fit in washing machine?" This is a common question, especially for such a large size. The idea of washing a big rug at home is appealing.

This article explores the practicalities of washing a 9x12 Ruggable rug cover. We will discuss machine capacities and offer washing strategies. You will learn how to best care for your large Ruggable. I will also share tips for proper drying and long-term maintenance. Let us find out how to keep your rug fresh and clean.

### Takeaway:

*   A 9x12 Ruggable rug cover is generally too large for standard residential washing machines.
*   You will likely need an extra-large capacity machine, like those at a laundromat.
*   Hand washing in a bathtub is a viable alternative for this large size.
*   Always wash only the Ruggable rug *cover*, never the rug pad.
*   Proper folding and drying are key to preventing damage and mildew.

A 9x12 Ruggable rug cover is typically too large for standard residential washing machines. Most home machines lack the necessary drum size for proper washing and rinsing of such a voluminous item. You will most likely need to use an extra-large capacity commercial washing machine found at a laundromat for effective cleaning.

## Understanding the Ruggable System: Cover vs. Pad

Ruggable rugs are unique in their design. They consist of two parts. There is a decorative rug cover on top. Underneath, there is a non-slip rug pad. This two-piece system makes Ruggable popular. The main reason is its washability.

The rug cover is the only part designed for machine washing. It attaches to the pad with a Hook-and-Loop system. This design makes it easy to detach for cleaning. The pad itself is not washable in a machine. You clean the pad separately by wiping it down. Understanding this distinction is vital for proper care.

Ruggable promotes its rugs as machine washable. This feature sets them apart from traditional rugs. Many people buy them specifically for this benefit. However, the washability claim mainly applies to smaller rug sizes. The size of your washing machine becomes a critical factor for larger rugs. A 9x12 Ruggable rug presents a significant challenge. Its sheer size means it takes up a lot of space.

You might think all Ruggable covers will fit in your home washer. This is not always true for the biggest sizes. The weight and bulk of a wet 9x12 cover are substantial. This can strain smaller machines. It also prevents the rug from getting clean. Proper care ensures your rug lasts a long time. Knowing which part to wash and how is the first step. For general washing instructions, you can refer to resources like [How to Wash a Ruggable](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-ruggable).

## The Reality of 9x12 Ruggable Dimensions and Weight

A 9x12 rug is a very large item. It measures nine feet by twelve feet. This converts to 108 inches by 144 inches. Even when folded, it occupies a substantial volume. Many people do not fully grasp this size until they try to wash it. The rug cover itself is thin but large.

When the rug cover absorbs water, its weight increases significantly. A dry 9x12 Ruggable cover weighs around 15-20 pounds. Once it is wet, this weight can easily double or triple. This added weight puts a lot of stress on your washing machine. Most home washers are not built for such heavy, water-soaked items. The drum could get damaged. The motor might struggle.

The sheer bulk of the rug cover is another issue. It needs enough space to move freely inside the washing machine. This movement is necessary for effective cleaning. If the rug is too tightly packed, detergent cannot reach all parts. Dirt and debris will not rinse away properly. The rug will come out still dirty. It might even smell musty if it does not dry quickly.

The actual dimensions of a 9x12 rug are important. This size is meant for large living rooms or dining areas. It covers a lot of floor space. Think about trying to fit a queen-sized comforter into your washer. A 9x12 Ruggable cover is even bigger than that. It is designed to be big. This big size means you need a big machine. Knowing [what is the actual size of a 9x12 rug](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-the-actual-size-of-a-9x12-rug) helps set realistic expectations for washing.

## Washing Machine Capacity: Standard vs. Extra-Large

Washing machine capacity is measured in cubic feet. This tells you how much laundry the machine can hold. Residential washing machines vary widely in size. Standard top-loaders usually have 3.0 to 4.5 cubic feet capacity. Standard front-loaders are often 4.0 to 5.0 cubic feet. These machines are fine for most household laundry. They can handle clothes, towels, and small blankets.

An extra-large capacity washing machine offers more space. These machines typically have 5.0 cubic feet or more. Some new models even reach 6.0 cubic feet. You usually find these larger machines in laundromats. Commercial washers are specifically built to handle very large loads. They have bigger drums and stronger motors. This allows for better cleaning of bulky items.

For a 9x12 Ruggable rug cover, an extra-large capacity machine is almost a necessity. The rug needs plenty of room to tumble. It needs to absorb water evenly. It also needs to rinse thoroughly. A smaller machine will pack the rug too tightly. This prevents proper washing. It can also cause problems with the machine's balance during spin cycles.

Consider the difference between agitator and impeller machines. Agitator machines have a central post. This post takes up space in the drum. Impeller machines use a low-profile cone or disc. They offer more usable space. An impeller-style machine, if large enough, might be slightly better. However, even a large impeller machine might struggle with a 9x12 Ruggable. The main challenge remains the sheer volume and weight. Always check your machine's capacity before attempting to wash a large rug. Understanding [how full a washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be) is crucial for effective cleaning.

## Effective Strategies for Washing a 9x12 Ruggable

Since a 9x12 Ruggable rug cover is challenging for home machines, you need other strategies. The key is to find enough space and power to clean it well. There are a few good options available. Each option has its own benefits and steps.

### Using a Commercial Laundromat

Laundromats are often the best choice for large Ruggable rugs. They have industrial-sized washing machines. These machines offer capacities of 6.0 cubic feet or more. Their large drums easily accommodate a 9x12 Ruggable cover. The powerful motors can handle the increased weight when wet.

Before you go, call ahead. Ask about their largest machine sizes. Confirm they can handle very large, bulky items. Once there, choose a machine. Load the folded rug cover carefully. Follow Ruggableâ€™s washing instructions. Use cold water and a mild detergent. Select a gentle cycle. Commercial machines vary, so ask staff for guidance if needed.

### Hand Washing in a Bathtub

If a laundromat is not an option, hand washing works. A clean bathtub provides ample space. This method requires more physical effort. First, fill the tub with cool water. Add a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Submerge the folded rug cover completely. Use your feet or a soft brush to agitate the rug. Gently scrub any soiled areas.

Let the rug soak for about 15-20 minutes. Drain the dirty water. Refill the tub with clean water. Rinse the rug thoroughly. Repeat rinsing until no more soap suds appear. This might take several rinses. Press as much water out as possible before removing the rug. This step is important for easier drying.

### Professional Rug Cleaning Services

Another option is to use a professional rug cleaning service. While Ruggable rugs are machine washable, professionals have expertise. They also have specialized equipment. This ensures a deep and thorough clean. However, this option costs more. It also defeats the purpose of owning a machine-washable rug. Most Ruggable owners prefer to do it themselves. But for unique situations or if you prefer not to manage the size yourself, it is an option. When considering general washable rugs, it helps to know if [do washable rugs fit in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-washable-rugs-fit-in-washing-machine).

## Preparing Your 9x12 Ruggable for the Wash Cycle

Proper preparation is crucial for a successful wash. It helps protect your rug and your machine. Skipping these steps can lead to poor cleaning or damage.

### Detach and Shake Out

First, detach the rug cover from its pad. Lay the rug cover flat. Give it a good shake outdoors. This removes loose dirt, dust, and pet hair. You can also use a vacuum cleaner. Vacuum both sides of the rug cover. This pre-cleaning step prevents clogs in your washing machine. It also helps the rug get cleaner faster.

### Pre-Treat Stains

Inspect the rug cover for any specific stains. Use a mild stain remover on these areas. Apply the cleaner directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes. Do not scrub too hard, as this can damage fibers. Always test stain removers on a small, hidden part of the rug first. This ensures it does not cause discoloration. Pre-treating increases the chances of removing stubborn marks.

### Proper Folding Technique

Folding a 9x12 Ruggable rug cover correctly is vital. Do not just stuff it into the machine. Fold it loosely. This allows water and detergent to circulate effectively. Start by folding the rug in half lengthwise. Then fold it in half again. Continue folding until it forms a manageable square or rectangle.

Avoid folding it too tightly. A tight fold can create creases. It also prevents water from reaching the inner layers. Aim for a gentle, accordion-style fold if possible. This helps maintain the rug's shape. It also makes loading and unloading easier. When you load it, distribute the weight evenly inside the drum. This helps balance the machine during the wash and spin cycles. This preparation is part of how you would [wash a Ruggable carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-ruggable-carpet) of any size.

## Recommended Washing Settings and Detergents

Choosing the right settings and detergents protects your Ruggable. It also ensures it gets clean without damage. Always follow Ruggableâ€™s specific care instructions. These instructions are typically found on the rug's label.

### Water Temperature

Always wash your Ruggable rug cover in cold water. Cold water helps prevent colors from fading. It also reduces the risk of shrinking. Hot water can be harsh on fabric fibers. It can also cause dyes to bleed. Using cold water is a simple step to preserve your rug's appearance. It is also more energy-efficient.

### Wash Cycle Selection

Select the most gentle cycle available on your washing machine. This is usually labeled "Delicate," "Gentle," or "Hand Wash." A gentle cycle minimizes agitation. This protects the rug fibers from damage. Avoid heavy-duty or strong spin cycles. These can stretch the rug or cause wear and tear. The goal is to clean effectively yet gently.

### Detergent Choices

Use a mild, non-bleach laundry detergent. Harsh chemicals like bleach can damage Ruggable's materials. They can also strip away colors. Choose a detergent free of strong additives. Liquid detergents often dissolve better in cold water. They also leave less residue than powder detergents. Use the recommended amount of detergent. Using too much can leave soap residue on the rug. This can make it feel stiff. It also attracts dirt more quickly.

### Avoiding Fabric Softeners and Bleach

Do not use fabric softeners. Fabric softeners can leave a residue. This residue might affect the rug's non-slip texture. It can also make the rug feel slick. Bleach should never be used on your Ruggable cover. Bleach will damage the fibers and cause permanent discoloration. Stick to mild detergents for the best results. Proper care ensures your rug stays vibrant and functional.

## Drying Your Large 9x12 Ruggable Rug Cover

Drying a large Ruggable rug cover properly is as important as washing it. Incorrect drying can lead to mildew, shrinking, or damage. Given its size, a 9x12 cover needs careful attention.

### Air Drying is Best

Ruggable strongly recommends air drying their rug covers. This is the safest method. Lay the rug cover flat in a clean, dry area. You can place it on a clothesline or over a railing. Ensure there is good air circulation. A garage, patio, or large open room works well. Air drying prevents heat damage and shrinking. It might take 24-48 hours for a 9x12 cover to dry completely. This depends on humidity and air flow.

If hanging, rotate the rug periodically. This promotes even drying. Make sure it is completely dry before placing it back on the rug pad. Even slight dampness can cause mildew or an unpleasant odor.

### Using a Dryer with Caution

If air drying is not possible, you can use a large capacity dryer. This means a commercial dryer at a laundromat. Do not use a residential dryer for a 9x12 Ruggable. It is too small and will not dry the rug evenly. It can also strain your home appliance.

When using a commercial dryer, select the lowest heat setting. A "Tumble Dry Low" or "Air Fluff" setting is ideal. High heat can damage the rug's fibers or cause shrinking. Put a few dryer balls in with the rug. These help circulate air and fluff the rug. This speeds up the drying process. Check the rug frequently. Remove it as soon as it is dry to prevent damage. Never leave it in a hot dryer for extended periods. Even on low heat, monitor it closely.

### Checking for Complete Dryness

Before putting the rug cover back on the pad, ensure it is fully dry. Feel all parts of the rug, especially the thicker edges. Any dampness can lead to mold growth. Mold can cause health issues and ruin your rug. If unsure, air it out for a few more hours. Taking the time to dry it properly extends your Ruggable's life.

## Maintaining Your 9x12 Ruggable Between Washes

Regular maintenance helps keep your 9x12 Ruggable fresh. It also extends the time between full washes. This is especially helpful for such a large rug. A little daily care makes a big difference.

### Regular Vacuuming

Vacuum your Ruggable rug regularly. This removes loose dirt, dust, and pet hair. Use a vacuum with a brushless or low-power setting. High-power beater bars can potentially damage the rug's fibers. Many Ruggable owners find their rugs are [easy to vacuum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/are-ruggable-rugs-easy-to-vacuum). Vacuuming every few days, or daily in high-traffic areas, prevents dirt from settling deep into the fibers. This keeps the rug looking clean.

### Spot Cleaning

Address spills and stains immediately. Blot the spill with a clean, dry cloth. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. For tougher spots, use a mild soap and water solution. Dampen a cloth with the solution. Gently blot the stain until it lifts. Rinse the area with a clean, damp cloth. Let the spot air dry completely. Quick spot cleaning prevents stains from setting. This maintains the rug's appearance.

### Rotate Your Rug

Rotate your 9x12 Ruggable rug every few months. This ensures even wear. It also exposes different parts of the rug to sunlight. Rotating helps prevent one area from fading more than another. It distributes foot traffic more evenly. This helps the rug last longer.

### Caring for the Rug Pad

Remember to care for the rug pad too. The pad is not machine washable. You can wipe it clean with a damp cloth. Use a mild soap solution for any stubborn marks. Make sure the pad is completely dry before reapplying the rug cover. This prevents moisture buildup between the layers. Proper care of both the cover and pad ensures the entire Ruggable system stays clean and functional.
