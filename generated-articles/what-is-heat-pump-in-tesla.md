In an electric vehicle, a heat pump uses a refrigerant. The refrigerant cycles through different states. It absorbs heat from one area and releases it in another. For example, to heat the cabin, the heat pump extracts heat from the outside air. It then transfers that warmth inside the car. This method is much more efficient than using an electric resistive heater. A resistive heater directly converts electricity into heat. This uses a lot of power from the battery. This fundamental difference is key for EV performance.

Heat pumps are crucial for electric vehicles. They help EVs save energy. This is especially true in colder climates. When it is cold, resistive heaters use a lot of battery power. This can significantly reduce an EV's driving range. A heat pump uses less energy to heat the cabin. This means more battery power remains for driving. It also helps manage the battery temperature.
