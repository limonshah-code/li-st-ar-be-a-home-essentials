## How To Clean My Dishwasher It Smells

Is a strange odor coming from your dishwasher? Many homeowners experience this frustrating problem. A smelly dishwasher means dirty dishes may not get properly cleaned. I understand how unpleasant a foul-smelling kitchen appliance can be.

This guide helps you understand why your dishwasher smells. We provide simple, effective methods to eliminate these odors. You will learn about cleaning different parts of the dishwasher. We also cover natural remedies and preventative maintenance. My goal is to help you restore freshness to your appliance.

### Takeaway

*   **Use commercial cleaners** for stubborn odors and mineral deposits.
*   **Maintain proper ventilation** and regular cleaning habits.

### Get Rid of Dishwasher Odors

To effectively clean your smelly dishwasher, first empty it completely. Then, remove and thoroughly clean the filter, spray arms, and door gasket. Finally, run a hot wash cycle using a cup of white vinegar or baking soda to sanitize and neutralize remaining odors.

### Why Your Dishwasher Smells: Identifying the Source of Odor

Your dishwasher should clean your dishes, not smell bad. Foul odors often indicate a buildup of food particles. These particles get trapped in various parts of the machine. Over time, they start to decompose and produce unpleasant smells.

Hard water can also contribute to odors. It leaves mineral deposits inside the appliance. These deposits provide places for mold and mildew to grow. If your dishwasher has a persistent damp smell, this might be the cause. My own experience taught me that moisture breeds problems.

Sometimes, the drain hose can be the culprit. Food debris and grease might accumulate there. This creates a blockage and prevents proper drainage. Water can then sit inside the dishwasher, leading to a stagnant smell. Understanding the source helps you tackle the problem directly.

You might also find that detergent residue contributes to the issue. Modern dishwashers often use less water. This can sometimes leave detergent scum behind. This scum traps food and creates a breeding ground for bacteria. Checking all these areas is key to finding the real problem.

### Initial Steps: Clearing Debris and Food Particles

Before you start any deep cleaning, prepare your dishwasher. Empty the dishwasher completely. Remove all dishes, racks, and cutlery baskets. This provides clear access to the interior.

Next, visually inspect the bottom of the dishwasher. Look for any large food scraps. These can include bits of leftover food from plates. I often find corn kernels or pasta fragments. Gently remove these pieces by hand or with a paper towel.

Pay close attention to the drain area. This is where water collects before draining out. Small seeds or bones can block it. Clearing this area is a quick win against odors. This step prevents future clogging.

After removing obvious debris, wipe down the interior. Use a damp cloth to wipe surfaces. This removes loose grime and any visible stains. This initial cleaning makes deeper cleaning more effective. A clean starting point makes the entire process simpler.

### Deep Cleaning the Filter: A Crucial First Strike

The dishwasher filter is a common source of odors. Food particles and grease get trapped here. A dirty filter prevents proper drainage and causes bad smells. Cleaning it regularly is essential for a fresh dishwasher.

Most dishwashers have a removable filter at the bottom. Consult your dishwasher's manual to locate it. Filters usually twist or unclip easily. Be careful not to force anything during removal.

Once the filter is out, rinse it under hot running water. Use a stiff brush or old toothbrush to scrub away debris. You might see a slimy film or stubborn food bits. A little dish soap can help cut through grease. I find that a good scrub makes a big difference.

Inspect the filter housing area inside the dishwasher too. Wipe away any grime or food residue you see there. After cleaning the filter thoroughly, reinsert it correctly. Ensure it clicks back into place. A clean filter significantly improves dishwasher performance and smell.

### Cleaning Dishwasher Spray Arms and Door Gaskets

The spray arms distribute water during a wash cycle. Small holes in the arms can get clogged with food and mineral deposits. This affects cleaning performance and can trap smelly residue. My experience shows these are often overlooked.

To clean the spray arms, remove them if possible. Many models allow the arms to unscrew. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear blocked holes. Rinse them under hot water to flush out any debris. This simple action can greatly improve water flow.

Next, focus on the door gasket. This rubber seal runs along the edge of the door. It prevents water from leaking out. Food particles, mold, and mildew love to hide here. You will often see black or brown buildup.

Use a damp cloth and an all-purpose cleaner to wipe the gasket. For stubborn mold, a toothbrush with a little white vinegar works well. Gently pull back the folds of the gasket to clean deep inside. Ensure you clean all crevices. This area holds much hidden grime. A clean gasket prevents leaks and eliminates odors.

### Natural Cleaning Solutions: Vinegar and Baking Soda Power

White vinegar and baking soda are excellent natural cleaners. They effectively tackle odors and grime in your dishwasher. These common household items are safe and readily available. I always keep them stocked for cleaning tasks.

To use white vinegar, first ensure the dishwasher is empty. Place a cup of white vinegar in a dishwasher-safe bowl. Put the bowl on the top rack of your dishwasher. Run a hot water cycle on the hottest setting. The vinegar will cut through grease and mineral deposits. It also acts as a deodorizer.

For baking soda, sprinkle one cup of it on the bottom of the empty dishwasher. Let it sit overnight if the smell is very strong. Baking soda absorbs unpleasant odors. The next morning, run a short hot wash cycle. This washes away the baking soda and any remaining smells. My kitchen smells much better after this.

You can also combine both methods. Run a vinegar cycle first. After that cycle finishes, sprinkle baking soda and run another short hot cycle. This dual approach provides a powerful cleaning action. These natural solutions are gentle on your appliance. They leave it fresh and clean.

### Commercial Dishwasher Cleaners: When to Use Them

Sometimes, natural methods need a little boost. Commercial dishwasher cleaners offer a more intensive solution. These products are formulated to dissolve tough grease, mineral buildup, and hard water stains. They are especially useful for very stubborn odors.

You can find various types of commercial cleaners. Some come in tablet form. Others are liquid or powder. Read the product instructions carefully before use. Typically, you place the cleaner in the detergent dispenser or directly in the bottom of the empty dishwasher. Then, run a hot wash cycle.

These cleaners often contain powerful degreasers and descalers. They reach areas you cannot easily scrub by hand. Using them every few months can maintain your dishwasher's freshness. This helps prevent odors from returning. I find them very effective for deep cleaning.

Consider commercial cleaners if your dishwasher has a distinct metallic or rotten egg smell. This often indicates heavy mineral deposits. A powerful cleaner can break down these compounds. Always ensure good ventilation when using chemical cleaners. Follow safety warnings on the packaging.

### Preventative Measures: Keeping Odors Away

Preventing odors is easier than removing them. Simple habits make a big difference. I learned that consistent care keeps my dishwasher smelling fresh. These actions ensure your appliance runs efficiently.

**Scrape Plates Before Loading:** Remove large food scraps from dishes. This prevents them from clogging the filter. It also reduces food decomposition inside the dishwasher. This simple step is vital.

**Run Full Loads Regularly:** Avoid letting dirty dishes sit too long. Food can dry onto plates and create odors. Running full loads frequently keeps your dishwasher active. It prevents smells from developing.

**Clean the Filter Routinely:** Make filter cleaning a habit. Check it weekly or bi-weekly. A clean filter means better drainage and no trapped food. This is one of the most effective preventative steps.

**Wipe Down the Door Gasket:** After each wash, quickly wipe the door seal. This removes moisture and any trapped food bits. It helps prevent mold and mildew growth. My gasket stays clean with this habit.

**Leave the Door Ajar After Cycles:** Allow your dishwasher to air dry. This prevents moisture buildup inside. Moisture creates a breeding ground for mildew and musty smells. A slightly open door makes a big difference.

**Utilize Vinegar or Baking Soda Monthly:** Run a cleaning cycle with vinegar or baking soda once a month. This keeps the interior fresh. It also prevents hard water scale from accumulating. This regular maintenance provides a clean scent throughout your kitchen. Just as you might use a [carpet shampooer to get the deep down smells out of your carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-carpet-shampooers-get-the-deep-down-smells-out), consistent cleaning prevents odors in all areas of your home.

**Check Drain and Hoses:** Occasionally inspect the drain area and hoses. Ensure no blockages are forming. If you notice slow drainage, address it promptly. Proactive checks can prevent significant odor issues.

### FAQ Section

#### Q1: Why does my dishwasher smell like rotten eggs?
A rotten egg smell often indicates a sulfur-related issue. This can be food decaying in the drain or filter. It also points to a buildup of hard water minerals. Thoroughly cleaning the filter and running a vinegar cycle helps eliminate this odor effectively.

#### Q2: Can I use bleach to clean my dishwasher?
Bleach is a strong disinfectant, but generally not recommended for dishwashers. It can damage stainless steel interiors and rubber seals over time. More importantly, mixing bleach with other cleaners (like vinegar) creates dangerous fumes. Stick to vinegar, baking soda, or specific dishwasher cleaners.

#### Q3: How often should I clean my dishwasher?
You should perform a light cleaning, like wiping the door gasket and checking the filter, weekly. A deep cleaning, using vinegar or commercial cleaner, is recommended monthly. This regular schedule prevents odors and keeps your dishwasher performing optimally.

#### Q4: Why does my dishwasher still smell after cleaning?
If the smell persists, you might have a deeper issue. Check the drain hose for blockages, as food can get trapped there. You might also have a plumbing issue causing sewage gas to back up. Consult a professional plumber if simple cleaning steps do not resolve the problem.

#### Q5: Can dirty dishes cause the dishwasher to smell?
Yes, absolutely. Leaving dirty dishes inside the dishwasher for extended periods allows food particles to decompose. This creates unpleasant odors even before you run a cycle. Scraping plates and running the dishwasher regularly prevent this common cause of smell.

#### Q6: Is it safe to put vinegar directly into the dishwasher?
Yes, it is perfectly safe to put white vinegar directly into your dishwasher. Place one cup of white vinegar in a dishwasher-safe bowl on the top rack. Then run a hot water cycle. Vinegar is a natural cleaner and deodorizer that will not harm your appliance.
