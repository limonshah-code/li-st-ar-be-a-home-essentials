LG dryers are designed with safety and efficiency in mind. They stop when conditions are not ideal for continued operation. This can prevent damage to the appliance or even fire hazards. Sometimes, the fix is straightforward, requiring just a quick clean or reset. Other times, it points to a component that needs repair or replacement. Pinpointing the exact cause is important for an effective solution.

Common reasons an LG dryer stops include clogged vents, faulty sensors, or power supply issues. Overheating protection can trigger a shutdown if the dryer gets too hot. A problem with the door switch also prevents the dryer from running. We will break down these specific reasons in detail. This information will help you bring your LG dryer back to full function.

## Ventilation Issues: The Number One Culprit for LG Dryer Interruptions

A clogged dryer vent is one of the most frequent reasons an LG dryer keeps stopping. Lint and debris accumulate in the vent over time. This buildup restricts airflow significantly. Restricted airflow traps hot air inside the dryer drum. This trapped heat causes the dryer to overheat rapidly.

Modern LG dryers have safety features to prevent overheating. A thermal fuse or high-limit thermostat activates when temperatures rise too high. This safety component shuts off the dryer immediately. The dryer stops to prevent damage to its internal parts or to avoid a fire. Ignoring a clogged vent can lead to serious hazards. I always recommend checking this first.

To fix this, you must clean your dryer's vent system. Start by cleaning the lint filter after every load. This is a simple but critical step. Beyond the filter, you also need to clean the vent duct itself. You can disconnect the dryer from the wall vent and use a special brush. Regular cleaning prevents lint buildup and ensures proper airflow. You can learn more about general cleaning practices for your LG dryer by visiting our guide on [how to clean LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer).

*   **Check the lint trap:** Always clean this before or after each load. A full lint trap severely restricts air flow.
*   **Inspect the exhaust vent hose:** Disconnect the hose from the dryer and the wall. Look for blockages inside. Clear any lint or debris.
*   **Clean the exterior wall vent cap:** Ensure the flapper opens and closes freely. Birds or small animals sometimes build nests there.
*   **Professional vent cleaning:** Consider hiring a professional service every 1-2 years for thorough duct cleaning. This ensures your entire ventilation system is clear.

Proper ventilation is crucial for your LG dryer's performance. It helps your dryer run efficiently. It also keeps your home safe. A clean vent system reduces drying times and prevents your dryer from stopping unexpectedly.

## Sensor Malfunctions: Why Your LG Dryer Stops Early

LG dryers use advanced sensors to monitor the drying process. These sensors detect moisture levels in the clothes. They also monitor the air temperature inside the drum. When a sensor malfunctions, it can cause the dryer to stop prematurely. The dryer might think clothes are dry when they are still damp. It could also misread the temperature, triggering a shutdown.

One common sensor issue involves the moisture sensor bars. These metal bars are usually located near the lint filter or inside the drum. Clothes tumble over them, completing an electrical circuit that detects moisture. If these bars get coated with fabric softener residue or lint, they cannot accurately sense moisture. The dryer will then stop early, thinking the clothes are dry. This happens often with my LG dryer if I forget to wipe them down.

*   **Clean moisture sensor bars:** Use a cotton swab or a soft cloth with rubbing alcohol. Gently wipe the metal strips clean. Do this regularly, especially if you use fabric softeners.
*   **Check the thermistor:** The thermistor monitors the temperature. If it fails, it sends incorrect temperature readings to the control board. This can cause the dryer to overheat or stop too soon. A faulty thermistor might require replacement. Testing it with a multimeter can confirm its condition.
*   **Inspect the high-limit thermostat:** This component acts as a safety switch. It trips if the dryer's temperature exceeds a safe limit. A faulty thermostat might trip too easily, even when the temperature is normal. This causes the dryer to stop. Testing for continuity with a multimeter can check its function.

A miscalibrated or dirty sensor often leads to your LG dryer taking too long to dry. Or, it might stop before the cycle finishes. This is because the dryer's internal computer receives bad data. Fixing sensor issues often resolves problems with cycles stopping early. This ensures your clothes get fully dry without wasted energy. If your LG dryer keeps saying "clean filter" even after you've cleaned it, a faulty sensor could also be the cause, as outlined in guides like [why does my LG dryer keep saying clean filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-keep-saying-clean-filter).

## Overheating Protection: When Your LG Dryer Shuts Down

LG dryers incorporate several safety features to prevent overheating. These features are vital for both the appliance's longevity and household safety. When internal temperatures exceed a safe limit, the dryer will automatically shut down. This protective measure prevents components from damage and reduces fire risks. I have seen this happen when the airflow is severely restricted.

The most common components involved in overheating protection are the thermal fuse and the high-limit thermostat. The thermal fuse is a one-time safety device. If it blows due to excessive heat, it permanently breaks the circuit, and the dryer will not start until it is replaced. The high-limit thermostat, on the other hand, is resettable. It will trip and cut power when a dangerous temperature is reached but will reset once the dryer cools down. A faulty high-limit thermostat can cause intermittent stopping.

*   **Check for airflow restrictions:** As discussed earlier, a clogged lint filter or blocked vent duct is the primary cause of overheating. Ensure all parts of the ventilation system are clear.
*   **Inspect the blower wheel:** Sometimes, debris or a sock can get past the lint filter and clog the blower wheel. A blocked blower wheel reduces airflow, causing heat buildup.
*   **Test the thermistor:** A malfunctioning thermistor might give false temperature readings. This can cause the dryer to overheat without proper control. If the thermistor is faulty, it needs replacement.
*   **Examine the heating element:** While rare, a faulty heating element can sometimes cause uneven heating or excessive heat. This can trip safety devices.

When your LG dryer keeps shutting off, especially after running for some time, overheating is a strong possibility. It is the dryer's way of telling you something is wrong with its thermal regulation. Addressing the root cause of the overheating is essential. This often means improving airflow.

## Power Supply and Electrical Problems Affecting LG Dryers

An LG dryer needs a stable and consistent power supply to operate correctly. Electrical issues can cause your dryer to stop unexpectedly. These problems might originate from your home's electrical system or the dryer's internal wiring. I once had a dryer stop due to a tripped breaker, which was a quick fix.

Dryers typically use a 240-volt electrical circuit. This high voltage requires specific wiring and breakers. If the circuit breaker trips, the dryer loses power. This can happen if the circuit is overloaded. It might also happen if there is a short circuit within the dryer. Checking your home's breaker panel is a good first step.

*   **Check the circuit breaker:** Locate your home's electrical panel. Find the breaker labeled for your dryer. If it is tripped (usually in the middle position), flip it completely off, then back on. This resets the circuit.
*   **Inspect the power cord:** Ensure the power cord is fully plugged into the wall outlet. Check for any visible damage to the cord itself. A damaged cord can lead to intermittent power.
*   **Test the wall outlet:** You can use a voltage tester to ensure the outlet is providing the correct voltage. If it is not, a licensed electrician should inspect your home's wiring.
*   **Look for loose wiring:** Inside the dryer, loose connections can interrupt power. This often requires disassembling part of the dryer. If you are not comfortable with electrical work, hire a technician.

Electrical problems can be dangerous. Always disconnect the dryer from power before inspecting internal components. If you suspect a serious electrical issue, consult a qualified electrician. Ensuring a proper power supply is fundamental for your LG dryer's reliable operation.

## Door Switch and Latch Problems: Preventing LG Dryer Operation

The door switch is a critical safety component in your LG dryer. It prevents the dryer from operating when the door is open. If the door switch malfunctions, the dryer's control board might incorrectly think the door is open. This will cause the dryer to stop, or prevent it from starting at all. I have seen this issue many times, and it is usually straightforward to identify.

A faulty door switch is a common reason for a dryer that starts and then quickly stops. It can also cause a dryer not to start at all. The switch plunger might be bent or broken. The internal contacts of the switch can wear out over time. Sometimes, debris can interfere with the switch's mechanism.

*   **Inspect the door latch:** Ensure the door closes firmly and latches securely. The latch needs to engage fully with the strike plate. A loose latch might not activate the switch properly.
*   **Examine the door switch itself:** The switch is usually located behind the dryer's front panel, near the door opening. You can visually inspect the plunger. If it is bent or stuck, it might need replacement.
*   **Test the door switch:** Use a multimeter to check for continuity across the switch terminals. Most door switches are "normally open" or "normally closed." They change state when the door closes. A lack of continuity when the door is closed indicates a faulty switch.
*   **Check wiring to the door switch:** Ensure all wires connected to the door switch are secure. Loose connections can mimic a faulty switch.

Replacing a door switch is often a relatively simple repair. You can usually find replacement parts online. Always ensure the dryer is unplugged before attempting any repairs. A working door switch guarantees proper operation and safety.

## Motor or Belt Issues: Mechanical Failures in Your LG Dryer

Mechanical failures like a faulty motor or a broken drive belt can cause your LG dryer to stop. The drive belt is crucial for spinning the dryer drum. The motor powers the belt and the blower fan. If either of these components fails, the dryer cannot complete its cycle. I have heard distinct noises when a belt is about to break.

A broken drive belt will prevent the drum from turning. The dryer might still heat, but clothes will not tumble. This lack of movement can trigger a shutdown. A worn belt might slip intermittently, causing the drum to stop and start. A failing motor might hum but not turn. Or, it might get too hot and trip its internal thermal overload.

*   **Listen for unusual noises:** A squealing or thumping sound often indicates a worn or damaged belt. A loud hum without drum rotation suggests a motor issue.
*   **Check the drive belt:** Disconnect the dryer from power. Access the drive belt (often by removing the top or front panel). Inspect the belt for fraying, cracks, or breaks. If it is broken, the drum will spin very freely by hand.
*   **Inspect the idler pulley:** The idler pulley keeps tension on the drive belt. If it is seized or broken, the belt will lose tension and slip. This can cause the dryer to stop.
*   **Examine the motor:** A dryer motor can fail for various reasons, including worn bearings or electrical issues. If the motor is faulty, it will need replacement. This is a more complex repair.

Replacing a drive belt is a common dryer repair. It often requires some disassembly of the appliance. A motor replacement is generally more involved. If you are unsure about these mechanical repairs, it is best to consult a professional technician. Mechanical issues often lead to your LG dryer taking too long to dry, as clothes do not tumble efficiently, or it stops early due to the lack of movement.
