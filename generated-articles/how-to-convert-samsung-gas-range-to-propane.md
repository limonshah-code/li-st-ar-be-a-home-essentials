If you feel unsure or uncomfortable at any point, stop and call a qualified professional. Your safety and the safety of your home come first.

### Shutting Off Gas and Power Supply

The very first and most important step is to cut off the gas supply to your range. Locate the main gas shut-off valve for your house or the specific valve for the range. Turn it to the "off" position. This stops gas from flowing to the appliance. Do not proceed until you confirm the gas is completely off.

Next, disconnect the range from its electrical power source. Unplug the range from the wall outlet. If your range is hardwired, turn off the circuit breaker that controls the range. This prevents accidental startup or electrical shock during the conversion. You should always confirm both gas and power are fully off before touching the appliance.

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucial for your safety. Always put on work gloves. Gloves protect your hands from sharp edges and potential chemical exposure. Safety glasses are also important. They shield your eyes from debris, dust, or any unexpected splashes.

Consider wearing long sleeves to protect your arms. A sturdy pair of closed-toe shoes is also advisable. Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry that could get caught in tools or components. These small preparations make a big difference in preventing injuries.

### Identifying and Preparing Your Workspace

Your workspace needs to be clear, clean, and well-lit. Remove any flammable materials from the area around the range. This includes curtains, paper towels, and cleaning solutions. Ensure there is ample light so you can clearly see all small components. You do not want shadows hiding important details.

Have all your tools laid out in an organized manner. This prevents you from fumbling around or losing small parts. Keep children and pets away from the work area. A calm and organized environment helps you focus on the task. Always double-check your preparations before diving into the conversion steps.

## Gathering Your Tools and Materials for Conversion

Before starting the conversion, you need the right tools and materials. Having everything ready beforehand makes the process smoother and safer. You do not want to stop mid-task because you are missing a wrench. Proper tools ensure you can perform each step accurately. This prevents damage to your appliance and frustration for you.

Gathering your tools also helps you visualize the steps. You can think through each movement and prepare accordingly. Always choose good quality tools. Cheap tools can break or strip screws, creating more problems. A little preparation now saves a lot of trouble later.

### Essential Tools List

You will need a specific set of tools for this conversion. First, get a Phillips head screwdriver. You will use it to remove panels and secure various parts. A flathead screwdriver is also necessary for some adjustments. Next, find a set of nut drivers or small wrenches. These are critical for removing and replacing gas orifices. Specific sizes like 7mm or 1/4 inch are common for orifice nuts.

You will also need pliers, possibly needle-nose pliers, for manipulating small components. A flashlight or headlamp is very helpful for seeing into tight spaces. Finally, you will need a small container to hold removed parts. This prevents losing tiny screws or orifices. Having these items organized ensures a smooth workflow.

### Necessary Materials and Supplies

Beyond tools, you need a few key materials. The most important item is the Samsung propane conversion kit specific to your range model. This kit contains the new orifices and regulator adjustment parts. If your range came with it, make sure you have it on hand. If not, you must purchase the correct kit.

You will also need a soapy water solution for leak testing. Mix liquid dish soap with water in a spray bottle. This mixture helps detect gas leaks visually. A soft cloth or paper towels are useful for cleaning and wiping. Make sure you have these materials ready before you start dismantling your range. A proper setup makes a significant difference in a successful conversion.

### Confirming the Conversion Kit

It is vital to confirm that you have the correct conversion kit. Check your Samsung range model number. This number is usually found on a label around the oven door frame or on the back of the appliance. Then, compare this model number with the kit's documentation. Ensure the kit explicitly states compatibility with your range.

Mismatching kits can lead to serious safety hazards. The orifices must be precisely sized for propane combustion in your range. If you are unsure, contact Samsung customer support. They can help you verify the correct kit for your model. Do not proceed without confirming your kit matches your appliance.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Converting Your Samsung Gas Range Burners

Now, let's get into the main part of the conversion. This section focuses on modifying the top surface burners. These are the most visible parts of your range, and their conversion is straightforward. Remember to work carefully and systematically. You will be replacing small parts, so attention to detail is key.

Each burner will need individual attention. We will cover how to access them, remove the old orifices, and install the new ones. Take your time with each step. Do not rush any part of the process. Following these instructions ensures your burners function correctly and safely with propane.

### Accessing the Surface Burners

First, remove the grates and burner caps from the cooktop. Lift them straight off and set them aside. Next, remove the burner heads themselves. These usually lift straight up or require a slight twist. Be gentle as you remove them. Underneath each burner head, you will see a small brass fitting. This is the natural gas orifice.

You might need to remove screws to lift the entire cooktop if your specific model requires it for better access. Consult your owner's manual for precise instructions on how to access the orifices. Some models allow access simply by removing burner components. Other models require lifting the cooktop. Make sure your workspace is clear.

### Replacing the Orifices

Use your nut driver or small wrench to carefully unscrew each natural gas orifice. Turn counter-clockwise to loosen them. These parts are small, so be careful not to drop them. Once removed, place the natural gas orifices in your designated container. This keeps them separate and prevents confusion.

Now, take the new, smaller propane (LP) orifices from your conversion kit. Screw them into the gas supply tubes where the old orifices were. Turn them clockwise until they are finger-tight, then gently snug them with your wrench. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the threads. Each orifice should be secure.

### Reassembling the Burners

After replacing all the orifices, you can begin reassembling the burners. Place the burner heads back over their respective orifices. Ensure they sit flat and are properly aligned. Next, put the burner caps back onto the burner heads. They should fit snugly. Finally, replace the grates on the cooktop.

Double-check that all components are in their correct positions. A misaligned burner cap can cause uneven flames or ignition issues. Once everything is back in place, your surface burners are ready for the next step. We will test them later in the process.

## Adjusting the Oven and Broiler for Propane Use

Converting the oven and broiler burners is just as important as converting the surface burners. These require similar changes to the orifices and an adjustment to the pressure regulator. The oven and broiler conversion steps are often more challenging due to their location. You will need to access parts deep inside the range. Take extra care during these steps.

This section will guide you through locating and replacing the oven and broiler orifices. We will also cover the crucial step of adjusting the gas pressure regulator. Proper adjustment here ensures safe and efficient operation of your oven and broiler. Precision is key for perfect cooking results.

### Converting the Oven Burner Orifice

Accessing the oven burner usually means removing racks and the bottom panel of the oven. Look for screws that hold the bottom panel in place. Once removed, you will see the oven burner tube. Follow the tube to find the orifice, often located near the gas valve or igniter. This orifice is usually larger than the top burner ones.

Carefully unscrew the natural gas oven orifice. Replace it with the specific LP oven orifice from your kit. Tighten it securely but avoid overtightening. After replacement, reattach the oven burner tube if you had to disconnect it. Then, replace the bottom oven panel and racks. Take your time to ensure all parts are correctly reinstalled.

### Converting the Broiler Burner Orifice

The broiler burner is typically located at the top of the oven cavity. Accessing it may involve removing the top oven panel or simply reaching in. Similar to the oven burner, locate the broiler burner tube and its natural gas orifice. Unscrew the old orifice.

Install the new LP broiler orifice from your conversion kit. Ensure it is tightly fastened. Once the new orifice is in place, reassemble any
