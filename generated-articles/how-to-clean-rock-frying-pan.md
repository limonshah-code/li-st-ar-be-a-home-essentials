This residue can make food stick.

To deep clean, you will use baking soda and vinegar. First, pour about one cup of water into the pan. Add two tablespoons of baking soda. You can also add a quarter cup of white vinegar. Place the pan on your stovetop. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Let it simmer for 5-10 minutes. The steam and the mixture help to loosen any tough residue. You might see some bubbling.

## Dishwasher Safety and Your Rock Frying Pan

A common question about any frying pan is whether it can go in the dishwasher. For your Rock frying pan, the answer is often yes, but with important considerations. While The Rock brand often states their pans are dishwasher safe, handwashing is always better. Handwashing extends the life of your non-stick coating. It prevents potential damage.

Dishwashers use high heat and strong detergents. These elements can be harsh on non-stick surfaces over time. The high heat can degrade the coating. The powerful water jets can chip or scratch it. Repeated dishwasher cycles may reduce the pan's non-stick effectiveness faster than handwashing. If you choose to use a dishwasher, place the pan on the top rack. This keeps it away from the strongest jets and highest heat.

Use a mild dishwasher detergent. Avoid harsh, abrasive detergents. After the cycle, remove the pan promptly. Dry it by hand to prevent water spots. Even if a pan says it is "dishwasher safe," this usually means it will not be ruined immediately. It does not mean it is the best method for long-term care. For the absolute best care for your Rock frying pan, handwashing remains the top choice.

## Avoiding Damage: What Not to Do When Cleaning

Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to do. Your Rock frying pan's non-stick surface is durable, but it is not immune to damage. Many common cleaning habits can shorten your pan's life. Do not use metal utensils for cooking or cleaning. Spoons, spatulas, or scrubbers made of metal will scratch the non-stick coating. Even small scratches can lead to peeling. This makes the pan less effective.

Avoid using abrasive cleaning pads or steel wool. These are too rough for the delicate non-stick surface. They will scrape away the coating. This exposes the bare metal underneath. Once the coating is compromised, food will start to stick. The pan's performance will decrease. Instead, stick to soft sponges, nylon scrubbers, or microfiber cloths.

Do not use harsh chemical cleaners. Oven cleaners, bleach, or strong degreasers can harm the non-stick material. These chemicals can break down the coating. They can also leave residues that are unsafe for cooking. Always choose mild dish soap. Use natural cleaners like baking soda and vinegar for tougher jobs. Never place a hot pan directly into cold water. This temperature shock can warp the pan. It can also weaken the non-stick layer. Protecting your pan means understanding these limits.

## Maintaining Your Rock Frying Pan's Longevity

Proper cleaning helps your Rock frying pan last. But longevity also depends on overall care. Following good cooking and storage habits makes a big difference. Always use low to medium heat when cooking. High heat can damage the non-stick surface over time. It can also burn food more easily. The Rock frying pan cooks well at lower temperatures. This saves energy. It also protects the pan.

Use a small amount of oil or butter when cooking. Even though the pan is non-stick, a little fat improves cooking. It also helps protect the surface. You do not need much. Just enough to coat the bottom. This prevents food from drying out too fast. It helps food slide easily. Remember to use only silicone, wooden, or heat-resistant plastic utensils. These materials are gentle on the non-stick coating.

Store your pan carefully. Do not stack other pans or heavy items directly inside it. This can cause scratches. Place a soft cloth or pan protector between stacked pans. This simple step guards the non-stick surface. If you hang your pan, ensure it does not rub against other items. Regular seasoning, if recommended by the manufacturer, can also help. These steps extend your pan's life. They keep it performing like new for many years.
