## Understanding Polywood Furniture: Why It Needs Cleaning

Polywood furniture is popular for many outdoor settings. It is a specific type of outdoor furniture. People choose it for its durability and low maintenance. Understanding what Polywood is helps you clean it correctly. Even tough materials collect dirt.

### What is Polywood?

Polywood is not wood at all. It is a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic. This material comes from recycled plastic containers. It does not absorb moisture. This makes it resistant to rot, splinting, and cracking. Polywood furniture is heavy and strong. It holds up well against harsh weather conditions. This includes intense sun, rain, and snow.

Because it is plastic, Polywood does not need painting or staining. It maintains its color well. However, its textured surface can still trap dirt. Over time, outdoor elements leave their mark. Understanding the material helps you choose the right cleaning methods.

### Common Dirt and Stains on Polywood

Polywood furniture, while durable, collects many types of dirt. Pollen is a very common issue, especially in spring. Dust settles on all surfaces. Tree sap can stick to the furniture. Bird droppings are another frequent problem. Food and drink spills happen often on patio furniture. These can leave sticky or greasy spots.

Mold and mildew can also appear. They thrive in damp, shady conditions. They look like black or green spots. Even though Polywood does not absorb moisture, these organisms can grow on surface residues. Regular cleaning prevents these common issues from becoming major problems. Dealing with these stains promptly keeps your furniture looking good.
