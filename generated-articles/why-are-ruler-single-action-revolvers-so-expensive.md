Limited production also allows for greater customization options. Buyers can sometimes specify finishes, engraving, or grip materials. This makes each revolver even more unique to its owner. These custom features further increase the cost but add immense personal value. The overall effect of limited availability is a market where high demand meets restricted supply. This naturally pushes the price of Ruler Single Action Revolvers into the premium category.

### Brand Legacy and Heritage: The Value of a Ruler Revolver Name

The name "Ruler" itself carries significant weight in the firearm community, contributing greatly to the high cost of their single action revolvers. A brand's legacy is built over decades, sometimes centuries, through consistent quality and innovation. Ruler has cultivated a reputation for excellence, reliability, and timeless design.
