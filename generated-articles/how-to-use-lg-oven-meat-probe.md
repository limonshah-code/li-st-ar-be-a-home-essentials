For poultry, place it in the thickest part of the thigh. Do not let it touch the bone. For whole birds, put it in the thickest part of the breast. Again, avoid bones.

Ensure at least 1-2 inches of the probe tip are inside the meat. This guarantees it measures the core temperature. If the meat is too thin, the probe might pass through. In such cases, use an external instant-read thermometer later. But for most roasts and large cuts, the LG probe works perfectly. Correct insertion is the first critical step for accurate cooking.

### Selecting Oven Settings and Desired Temperature

With the meat probed and placed in the oven, it is time to set your oven. Close the oven door. Select the desired cooking mode first. This might be "Bake," "Roast," or "Convection Roast." Then, locate the "Meat Probe" or "Probe" button on your LG oven's control panel. Pressing this button activates the probe function. The display will likely show the current internal temperature of the meat.

Next, set your target temperature. Use the numeric keypad or arrow buttons to input the desired final temperature. For example, you might set it to 145Â°F for medium-rare beef. Confirm your selection. The oven will then start preheating if it has not already. It will cook until the meat reaches the set temperature. Some LG ovens will automatically switch to a "Keep Warm" setting or turn off. This feature is very convenient. It prevents overcooking.
