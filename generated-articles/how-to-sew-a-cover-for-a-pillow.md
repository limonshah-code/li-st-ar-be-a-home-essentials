To sew a cover for a pillow, gather fabric and basic sewing supplies. Measure your pillow, cut fabric accurately, and then stitch the pieces together, often using an envelope or zipper closure. This simple project helps you create custom home decor.

## Essential Supplies for Sewing a Pillow Cover

Before you begin to sew a cover for a pillow, gather your supplies. Having everything ready saves time and makes the process smooth. You will need fabric, a sewing machine, and basic sewing tools. Thinking about your desired look helps you choose the right materials. This preparation step sets you up for success.

A good fabric choice changes the feel of your finished pillow. Consider the pillow's use and your home's style. Cotton is a popular choice because it is easy to work with and durable. Linen offers a natural, textured look. For a softer feel, try velvet or fleece. Think about patterns and colors that match your existing decor.

### Fabric Selection

Choosing the right fabric is important when you want to sew a cover for a pillow. Your fabric choice affects both the look and durability of the cover. Consider where the pillow will sit. For a sofa pillow, a sturdy cotton or upholstery fabric works well. For a bedroom pillow, a softer fabric like cotton sateen or flannel feels nice.

Think about the fabric's weight and texture. Lighter fabrics are easier to sew for beginners. Heavier fabrics provide more structure and resist wear. Always preshrink your fabric before cutting and sewing. Wash and dry it the way you plan to wash the finished pillow cover. This step prevents your finished cover from shrinking unevenly later.

### Basic Tools and Notions

Having the correct tools makes sewing much easier. You will need a sewing machine, thread, scissors, and a measuring tape. A rotary cutter and mat are also helpful for precise cuts. Pins or fabric clips hold pieces together. An iron and ironing board are crucial for crisp seams.

Do not forget other small items, called notions. A seam ripper fixes mistakes quickly. A fabric marker or tailor's chalk helps you mark cutting and sewing lines. Good quality thread prevents stitches from breaking. Using the right needle for your fabric type also makes a difference. These tools ensure your project goes smoothly from start to finish. If you want to make your own pillow, having these tools also helps. [You can learn how to make your own pillow here.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-your-own-pillow)

## Measuring and Cutting Fabric for Your Pillow

Accurate measurements are vital when you sew a cover for a pillow. A perfectly fitting cover starts with precise numbers. Do not guess your pillow's size. Take the time to measure it carefully. This step prevents your cover from being too tight or too baggy.

Once you have your measurements, calculating the fabric needed is next. Remember to add extra for seam allowances and closure types. Cutting your fabric straight and even ensures a clean finish. Take your time during this stage. A well-cut piece of fabric is easier to sew.

### Pillow Dimensions

To get the correct fabric size, first measure your pillow insert. Use a measuring tape to find the length and width of the pillow. Measure from seam to seam. For example, a standard throw pillow might be 18 inches by 18 inches. Write these measurements down.

If your pillow is very plush, you might add an inch or two to your measurements. This extra length helps the cover fit over a fluffy pillow without squishing it. For a square pillow, length and width are the same. For a rectangular pillow, note both dimensions separately. Knowing the exact size of a regular pillow helps you plan.

### Calculating Fabric Needs

Once you have your pillow's dimensions, you can calculate the fabric needed. For a simple envelope-style pillow cover, you need one main piece of fabric. This piece wraps around the pillow. Add 1 inch to both the length and width of your pillow for seam allowances. So, an 18x18-inch pillow needs a fabric piece 19x19 inches.

For the envelope flaps, you need two additional pieces. Each flap should be the full width of your pillow plus 1 inch. For the length, divide your pillow's length by two, add 4-6 inches for the overlap, and add 1 inch for seam allowance. For example, for an 18-inch wide pillow, two pieces would be 19 inches wide. Their length might be (18 / 2) + 5 + 1 = 15 inches each. Always draw a simple diagram to visualize your cuts before you start. This visual check helps avoid mistakes.

## Simple Envelope Closure Pillow Cover

An envelope closure pillow cover is an excellent project for beginners. It does not require zippers or buttons. The fabric overlaps in the back, creating an opening to insert the pillow. This design is quick to sew and looks clean. It is also very easy to remove for washing.

This type of pillow cover is popular for decorative pillows. It provides a neat finish without extra hardware. Once you learn this method, you can make many pillow covers quickly. It is a fundamental skill for anyone wanting to sew a cover for a pillow.

### Preparing Fabric Pieces

After cutting your fabric based on your pillow's dimensions, prepare the back pieces. You should have one large front piece and two smaller back pieces. For the two back pieces, hem one long edge on each. Fold the edge over by 1/2 inch, press, then fold another 1/2 inch and press again. Stitch this hem in place. This creates a neat, finished edge for your overlap.

Lay your main front fabric piece right side up. Place one back piece on top, right side down, aligning the raw edges on one side. The hemmed edge will be in the middle of the pillow. Place the second back piece on top, right side down, aligning its raw edges on the opposite side. The hemmed edges of the two back pieces will overlap in the center. Pin all layers together around the entire perimeter.

### Stitching the Overlap

Now, you will stitch the pieces together. Use a 1/2-inch seam allowance. Sew all the way around the four edges of the pinned fabric. Make sure to backstitch at the beginning and end of your stitching. This secures the seams and prevents them from unraveling. Go slowly and keep your seam allowance consistent.

After sewing all four sides, clip the corners. Cut diagonally across each corner, close to the stitching line but without cutting through it. This reduces bulk in the corners. It helps them look sharp when you turn the cover right side out. Turn the pillow cover right side out through the envelope opening. Use a blunt object, like a chopstick, to gently push out the corners. Press the seams flat with an iron for a crisp finish. Now you have a finished envelope pillow cover!

## Adding a Zipper to Your Pillow Cover

Adding a zipper to your pillow cover offers a more secure closure. It gives your pillow a professional and sleek look. Zippers are great for pillows that get a lot of use. They hold the pillow insert firmly inside. While adding a zipper seems more complex, it is very doable with a few simple steps.

A zippered pillow cover is also very practical. It makes changing out the cover easy. The zipper keeps the pillow insert from peeking out. Learning to sew a zipper is a valuable skill for many sewing projects, not just pillow covers. [You can get more detailed instructions on how to sew a zipper on a pillow.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-sew-a-zipper-on-a-pillow)

### Zipper Placement

Decide where you want the zipper. Most people put the zipper along one of the bottom edges. This placement keeps the zipper hidden when the pillow sits on a sofa. You will cut two main fabric pieces for a zippered cover: a front and a back. Both pieces should be the exact dimensions of your pillow plus seam allowances.

Measure your zipper length. Your fabric opening should be slightly shorter than your zipper. For example, if you have an 18-inch pillow, your zipper might be 16 or 17 inches. This ensures the zipper tabs are tucked neatly into the seams. Mark the start and end points of your zipper on your fabric edge.

### Sewing the Zipper

To sew the zipper, place the front and back fabric pieces right sides together. Stitch the edge where the zipper will go, starting and ending at the zipper marks. Use a regular stitch length. Leave the space between the marks unstitched. Press the seam open. Place your zipper face down over the open seam, centering it. Use temporary fabric adhesive or tape to hold the zipper in place.

Switch to a zipper foot on your sewing machine. Stitch along both sides of the zipper, close to the zipper teeth. Stitch across the ends of the zipper as well. This attaches the zipper to the fabric. Once sewn, carefully use your seam ripper to open the stitches in the fabric that cover the zipper teeth. This exposes the zipper. Now you can open and close your zipper.

### Securing the Edges

After installing the zipper, finish sewing the pillow cover. Place the front and back pieces with the zipper right sides together. Pin the remaining three raw edges. Sew around these three edges using a 1/2-inch seam allowance. Backstitch at the start and end. Be careful when sewing over the zipper ends; you might need to hand crank your machine over the bulk.

Trim the corners to reduce bulk, just as you would for an envelope closure. Turn the pillow cover right side out through the open zipper. Gently push out the corners. Press the entire pillow cover with an iron. Your professional-looking zippered pillow cover is now ready to use. This method creates a durable and neat finish.

## Creative Embellishments and Finishing Your Pillow Cover

Sewing a basic pillow cover is a great start. Adding embellishments can make your pillow truly unique. These details allow you to express your personal style. Think about textures, colors, and shapes that complement your design. Finishing touches can elevate a simple pillow cover into a decorative statement.

From simple ruffles to intricate piping, the options are endless. These additions are not just for looks. They can also add durability or a different feel to your pillow. Take your time with these details. They show the quality of your work.

### Adding Ruffles

Ruffles add a soft, playful touch to any pillow cover. They create visual interest and texture. To add ruffles, you will need a long strip of fabric. This strip should be at least 1.5 to 2 times the total perimeter of your pillow. The width of the strip determines how full your ruffle will be. For example, a 3-inch wide strip creates a 1.5-inch ruffle when finished.

Gather the fabric strip by sewing two rows of basting stitches along one long edge. Pull the bobbin threads to create gathers until the ruffle strip matches the perimeter of your pillow cover front. Pin the ruffled edge to the right side of your pillow cover front, aligning raw edges. Stitch the ruffle in place. You can learn more about how to make a ruffle for a pillow to get perfect results.

### Piping Detail

Piping adds a crisp, defined edge to your pillow cover. It gives a very professional, store-bought look. Piping is fabric-covered cording. You can buy pre-made piping or make your own from bias tape and cording. To attach piping, pin it to the right side of your pillow cover front, aligning the raw edges of the piping with the raw edges of the pillow cover. Use a zipper foot to stitch the piping to the pillow front, sewing close to the cording.

When you sew the front and back of the pillow cover together, the piping will be sandwiched inside. This creates a clean edge that stands out. Piping can also add a contrasting color or texture, enhancing the design of your pillow. It is a detail that shows care and skill in your sewing.

### Care and Maintenance

Once your beautiful pillow cover is finished, you will want to keep it looking great. Proper care helps extend the life of your handmade item. Always check the fabric care instructions before washing. Most cotton pillow covers can be machine washed on a gentle cycle with cold water. Use a mild detergent.

Air dry your pillow covers if possible. This helps prevent shrinkage and maintains fabric quality. If you must use a dryer, choose a low heat setting. Iron your pillow cover as needed to remove wrinkles. This keeps your custom creation looking fresh. Knowing how to clean pillow cases properly ensures your efforts last.

## Troubleshooting Common Pillow Sewing Issues

Even experienced sewers run into challenges. When you sew a cover for a pillow, you might encounter small problems. Do not get discouraged. Most issues have simple solutions. Understanding common pitfalls helps you fix them quickly. This section offers practical advice for common sewing headaches.

Learning from mistakes improves your skills. It teaches you how to problem-solve. Remember that practice makes perfect. Each time you sew a pillow cover, you gain more confidence. These tips will help you create a beautiful product, even if bumps appear on the road.

### Dealing with Puckering Seams

Puckering seams happen when the fabric gathers or wrinkles along the stitch line. This often results from incorrect tension on your sewing machine. First, check your machine's tension settings. If the top thread tension is too tight, it pulls the fabric. Adjust it slightly to loosen the tension.

Another cause is using the wrong needle or thread for your fabric. A dull needle can snag fabric. Too-thick thread can pull thin fabric. Ensure your needle matches your fabric weight. Using a walking foot can also help feed layers of fabric evenly, preventing puckers. Ironing your seams as you go helps keep them flat.

### Uneven Stitches and Edges

Uneven stitches can make a project look less professional. This issue often comes from inconsistent speed on the sewing machine. Try to maintain a steady speed as you sew. Do not rush. Guide the fabric gently; do not pull or push it through the machine. The machine's feed dogs do most of the work.

Uneven edges usually result from inaccurate cutting. Always use a ruler and sharp rotary cutter or scissors. Mark your cutting lines clearly. When sewing, align fabric edges precisely before you stitch. Use pins or clips generously to hold the fabric together. Practice sewing straight lines on scrap fabric to improve your consistency.

### Fixing Fit Issues

Sometimes, a finished pillow cover may not fit perfectly. It might be too loose or too tight. If the cover is too loose, it means you cut your fabric too large. You can fix this by turning the cover inside out and sewing new seams. Stitch about 1/4 to 1/2 inch inside your original seams. This makes the cover smaller.

If the cover is too tight, you likely cut the fabric too small. This is harder to fix without starting over. However, if it is just slightly tight, you might be able to stretch the fabric a bit. For future projects, always measure your pillow insert accurately. Add adequate seam allowance. Remember that different fabrics have different amounts of stretch.

## Beyond Basic Pillow Covers: Ideas for Advanced Projects

Once you master sewing a basic pillow cover, you can explore more complex projects. These advanced techniques help expand your sewing skills. They allow for even more customization in your home decor. Think about how you can apply your new knowledge to other items. This section offers ideas to challenge yourself further.

Moving beyond simple designs adds layers of interest to your sewing journey. You can create unique items for your home. These projects might require a bit more patience but offer great rewards. Your sewing machine becomes a tool for endless creativity.

### Box Cushion Covers

A box cushion cover is a step up from a flat pillow cover. It has side panels, giving the cushion a three-dimensional shape. This is perfect for bench cushions or outdoor seating. The principles are similar to sewing a pillow cover, but you add extra pieces. You will need to measure the thickness of your cushion in addition to its length and width.

Box cushion covers often feature zippers or Velcro closures. This helps you remove them for cleaning. Sewing corners for a box cushion requires precision. It involves sewing straight lines and sharp turns. Mastering this project will give you confidence for even larger sewing tasks.

Slipcovers transform old furniture. They give a room an entirely new look. This project requires accurate measuring and pattern making.

You might need to make a muslin prototype first. This helps ensure a good fit before cutting into your main fabric. Slipcovers often include zippers, ties, or elastic for a snug fit. It is a challenging but very rewarding project for a dedicated sewer. Learning how to sew a chair slipcover can transform your furniture.

### Specialty Pillow Shapes

Do not limit yourself to square or rectangular pillows. You can sew covers for unique pillow shapes. Consider neck roll pillows, bolster pillows, or even floor cushions. Each shape presents its own sewing challenges. A round pillow, for example, requires sewing curves. This helps you refine your precision sewing skills.

Using different fabrics and trims can also make specialty pillows stand out. Try adding tufting, buttons, or even fabric painting. These elements turn a functional item into a piece of art. Experiment with various techniques. Your imagination is the only limit.
