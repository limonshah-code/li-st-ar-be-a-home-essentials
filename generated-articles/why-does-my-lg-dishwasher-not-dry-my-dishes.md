### Why does my LG dishwasher not dry my dishes?

Your LG dishwasher does not dry dishes due to several reasons. These include low rinse aid levels, incorrect cycle selection, and improper dish loading. It can also stem from a malfunctioning heating element, clogged vent, or issues with your home's water temperature. Addressing these areas usually resolves the problem.

## Understanding LG Dishwasher Drying Mechanisms

LG dishwashers use different methods to dry dishes. Most models rely on a combination of residual heat and condensation drying. Some premium models include a fan-assisted drying system. Understanding how these systems work helps diagnose problems. I find it useful to know the basics before troubleshooting.

In condensation drying, the dishwasher uses heat from the wash and rinse cycles. The dishes get hot, and water evaporates from their surfaces. The dishwasher's stainless steel interior cools faster than the dishes. Moisture condenses on the cooler walls and then drains away. This method is energy efficient but sometimes leaves plastic items damp. Fan-assisted drying actively pulls moist air out. This helps dry items more thoroughly. If your LG dishwasher is not drying dishes, it means one of these mechanisms is failing. Check your specific model's drying method first.

Modern LG dishwashers often prioritize energy efficiency. This means they may not use a traditional heating element for drying. Instead, they rely on higher final rinse temperatures. This superheats the dishes and allows condensation to occur. Using the "Extra Dry" or "Night Dry" option on your LG dishwasher can improve results. These settings extend the drying time or add heat. I always recommend checking your dishwasher manual for specific drying instructions. This ensures you understand your model's unique features.

## The Critical Role of Rinse Aid

Rinse aid is perhaps the most overlooked component in achieving dry dishes. Many people skip it or forget to refill the dispenser. However, rinse aid is essential for proper drying in an LG dishwasher. I always emphasize its importance to my friends and family. It truly makes a difference in dish drying quality.

Rinse aid changes the surface tension of water. It prevents water droplets from clinging to dishes. Instead, water sheets off the surfaces. This allows for better evaporation and condensation. Dishes come out with fewer water spots and dry faster. Without rinse aid, water forms beads. These beads remain on dishes, especially plastics. They dry into visible water spots or simply leave dishes wet. This is a common reason why your LG dishwasher is not drying dishes properly. You might also notice [residue on your dishes after the dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-there-residue-on-my-dishes-after-dishwasher).

To check your rinse aid, open the dispenser on the inside of the dishwasher door. Most LG models have a small indicator window. If the indicator shows low or empty, refill it immediately. Use a high-quality rinse aid. I typically fill mine once a month, depending on usage. If you have hard water, using rinse aid is even more crucial. Hard water minerals can exacerbate water spotting and make drying difficult. Ensure the dispenser cap is securely closed after refilling. A loose cap can cause rinse aid to leak out too quickly.

## Correct Dish Loading and Cycle Selection

How you load your dishwasher significantly impacts drying performance. Overcrowding is a common mistake I see. It prevents water and air from circulating freely. This means some dishes will remain wet, even if the drying system works. Proper loading is key to solving why your LG dishwasher is not drying dishes.

Place dishes so they do not nest or overlap. Water needs to reach all surfaces. Air also needs to flow around them during the drying phase. Separate spoons and forks in the utensil basket. Do not block the spray arms. These arms rotate to spray water, and obstructions hinder their movement. Ensure taller items like baking sheets or platters do not block the dispenser. You can learn more about [how to prepare dishes for dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-prepare-dishes-for-dishwasher) for optimal results.

Choosing the right wash cycle is also important. LG dishwashers offer various cycles like "Auto," "Normal," "Heavy," and "Delicate." Many cycles include different drying options. Look for settings like "Extra Dry," "Night Dry," or "High Temp Dry." Selecting a cycle with a more intensive drying option helps. For instance, the "Normal" cycle with "Extra Dry" often yields better results. If you choose a quick wash cycle, it might have a shorter or no heated dry phase. This is often why your [dishwasher is not drying dishes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-dishwasher-not-drying-dishes). Always match the cycle to your load for best results. Some users wonder [why their LG dishwasher takes so long to wash](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-take-so-long-to-wash) as well, but longer cycles often mean better cleaning and drying.

## Investigating Heating Element and Thermistor Issues

A common reason for poor drying is a problem with the heating element. The heating element warms the water during the wash cycle. It also provides the heat needed for the drying phase in many dishwasher models. If your LG dishwasher is not drying dishes, the heating element might be faulty. I check this part first when troubleshooting a lack of heat.

To check the heating element, look for signs of damage. It sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It should appear intact, usually as a metal coil. If it is broken, corroded, or has visible burn marks, it needs replacement. You can also test its continuity with a multimeter. A working element will show continuity. No continuity indicates a broken element. Replace it if it fails this test. This requires turning off power to the dishwasher first for safety.

The thermistor works with the heating element. It is a sensor that monitors water temperature. It also detects air temperature during the drying cycle. If the thermistor sends incorrect temperature readings, the dishwasher's control board might not activate the heating element correctly. This means the heating element might not turn on, or it might turn off too soon. This leaves your dishes wet. Testing the thermistor involves checking its resistance with a multimeter. The resistance values change with temperature. Refer to your LG dishwasher's service manual for the correct resistance range. A faulty thermistor should be replaced.

## Addressing Clogged Vents and Airflow

Airflow is crucial for effective drying in a dishwasher. Many LG dishwashers use a vent system to release moist air during the drying cycle. If this vent becomes clogged or blocked, moisture gets trapped inside the tub. This leads to wet dishes. If your LG dishwasher is not drying dishes, inspect the vent.

The vent is usually located on the top left or right side of the dishwasher door. Sometimes it is on the top of the dishwasher itself. It can accumulate food particles, lint, or debris over time. Use a small brush or a damp cloth to clean the vent area. Ensure nothing is physically blocking the vent opening, such as a tall dish or a piece of cutlery. Proper ventilation allows moist air to escape. This helps dishes dry completely through condensation or fan-assisted drying.

Some LG dishwashers also have a vent fan. This fan actively pushes humid air out of the dishwasher. If this fan is not working, air circulation is impaired. The fan might be faulty, or its motor could have failed. You can usually hear this fan operating during the drying cycle. If you hear no fan noise, it might be the culprit. A technician can test and replace a faulty vent fan assembly. Ensuring clear airflow is a simple but effective step. It often resolves the issue of your LG dishwasher not drying dishes.

## Optimizing Water Temperature and Supply

The temperature of the water used in your LG dishwasher plays a significant role in drying. Hot water helps to activate the detergent and clean dishes effectively. More importantly, hot water helps dishes reach a higher temperature during the final rinse. This residual heat is critical for condensation drying. If your LG dishwasher is not drying dishes, check your water supply.

Ensure your water heater is set to at least 120°F (49°C). This is the minimum recommended temperature for dishwashers. If your water heater is too far from the dishwasher, the water might cool down on its way. Run the hot water tap in your kitchen sink for a minute or two before starting the dishwasher. This purges cold water from the pipes. This simple step ensures the dishwasher receives hot water from the start.

Sometimes, the dishwasher itself has internal water heating issues. This could relate back to the heating element or thermistor, as discussed earlier. However, the primary external factor is your home's hot water supply. If your hot water is not hot enough, dishes will not reach the necessary temperature for proper evaporation. This results in puddles of water remaining on surfaces. This is a common but often overlooked reason for a wet LG dishwasher interior and damp dishes. Verify your water heater settings. Also, ensure no other appliance is drawing too much hot water simultaneously.

## Dealing with Drainage and Hard Water Concerns

Efficient drainage is vital for a dishwasher's overall performance, including drying. If water remains at the bottom of the tub, it indicates a drainage problem. This excess moisture prevents dishes from drying thoroughly. A dishwasher that does not drain properly often leaves dishes wet. If your [LG dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom), it will struggle to dry.

Check the drain filter at the bottom of your dishwasher. Food particles can clog it, impeding proper drainage. Clean the filter regularly by removing it and rinsing it under running water. Also, inspect the drain hose for kinks or blockages. A partially clogged drain hose can lead to standing water. This moisture then re-condenses on dishes. Ensure the air gap, if your plumbing includes one, is also clear.

Hard water can also affect drying performance. Hard water contains high levels of minerals like calcium and magnesium. These minerals leave spots and films on dishes. This makes them appear dirty or wet, even when dry. These mineral deposits also hinder the sheeting action of rinse aid. If you have hard water, increasing rinse aid dosage can help. Consider using a dishwasher cleaner designed for hard water. Some LG dishwashers have a built-in water softener. If yours does, ensure it is properly maintained and refilled with salt. Hard water can also affect the lifespan of internal components. Addressing hard water improves both cleanliness and drying.
