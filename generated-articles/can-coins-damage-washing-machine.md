## How Coins Become a Problem for Your Washing Machine

Coins are small and heavy. They go through the laundry cycle with your clothes. During the wash, the machine spins rapidly. These small metal discs become projectiles. They bang against the drum and other parts. This constant impact causes different types of damage.

Most washing machines are built to handle water and fabric. They are not made for hard, metallic objects. Coins can slip through small openings in the drum. They can then reach sensitive mechanical parts. This is where real trouble begins for your appliance. Understanding this helps us see the bigger picture. We need to be proactive to prevent damage.

### The Journey of a Coin: From Pocket to Problem

A coin's journey inside your washing machine starts in a pocket. If you forget to check, the coin enters the wash cycle. Water and detergent quickly loosen it from the fabric. It then tumbles freely with your clothes. The machine's agitation pushes it around.

During the spin cycle, the forces become much stronger. The coin can hit the inner walls of the drum. It can also fall through small holes in the drum. Once outside the drum, it enters the machine's inner workings. This area contains the pump, hoses, and heating elements. This is a critical stage for potential damage.

## Common Types of Damage Caused by Coins

Coins cause several types of damage to washing machines. These issues range from minor cosmetic problems to severe mechanical failures. Knowing these risks helps you understand why prevention is key. Small coins can create big repair bills.

I always advise caution when doing laundry. Each type of damage affects different parts of the machine. The repair costs also vary greatly. Understanding the specific problems helps in troubleshooting. It also helps you appreciate the importance of checking pockets.

### Drum Scratches and Dents

One of the most common issues is drum damage. Coins tumble and scrape against the inner surface of the drum. This can cause visible scratches and small dents. In a top-loader, coins might get stuck under the agitator. They can then repeatedly scratch the tub during cycles.

While minor scratches may seem harmless, they can worsen over time. Deep scratches can snag delicate fabrics, potentially damaging your clothes. They also weaken the drum's surface. This makes it more prone to future damage from other objects. My personal experience shows that even a single rough edge can ruin a favorite shirt.

### Clogged Drain Pump and Filter

This is often a major problem. Coins can fall out of the drum and into the drain system. They then get stuck in the drain pump or filter. The drain pump removes water from the machine. If it is blocked, the machine cannot drain properly. This leads to standing water in the tub.

A clogged pump can stop the machine mid-cycle. It can also cause the pump motor to burn out. Replacing a drain pump can be expensive. This type of damage requires professional help. You might notice your [washing machine taking a long time to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be). This can be a sign of a clogged drain pump.

### Damaged Hoses and Belts

Coins that escape the drum can also hit hoses and belts. The drain hose or other water supply lines can be punctured. A punctured hose will leak water. This can cause significant water damage to your laundry room. Water leaks can also lead to mold growth.

The drive belt connects the motor to the drum. If a coin gets lodged near it, it can fray or snap the belt. A broken drive belt means the drum cannot spin. This stops the washing machine completely. These types of repairs are often complex. They typically require a skilled technician to fix.

### Impeller or Agitator Problems

In top-loading machines, coins can get under the impeller or agitator. The impeller or agitator helps move clothes during the wash cycle. If a coin gets jammed, it can damage these plastic parts. It might even prevent them from spinning correctly.

Damage to the impeller or agitator reduces cleaning performance. Your clothes may not get as clean. The machine might also make loud grinding noises. Repairs involve removing and replacing these components. This often means disassembling a significant portion of the washing machine.

### Heating Element Damage (for some models)

Some washing machines have exposed heating elements. If a coin reaches this area, it can cause problems. It might short-circuit the element. This can prevent the water from heating. In severe cases, it could even pose a fire risk.

This type of damage is less common but very serious. It usually occurs in older models or specific designs. Modern machines often have better protection for heating elements. Still, the possibility highlights the general risk of foreign objects.

## Preventing Coin Damage: Simple Steps to Protect Your Washer

Preventing coin damage is straightforward. It mostly involves forming good habits. These habits save you money and extend your washing machine's life. I always emphasize proactive measures over reactive repairs. A few seconds of effort can prevent hours of frustration.

My advice comes from years of experience. I have seen many appliances ruined by simple oversight. These preventive steps are easy for anyone to follow. They become second nature very quickly. Make them part of your laundry routine today.

### Always Check Pockets Thoroughly

This is the golden rule of laundry. Before putting any item into the washing machine, check all pockets. This includes jeans, jackets, shirts, and even towels with hidden pockets. Feel around for coins, keys, pens, or other small items. I always tell people to turn pockets inside out. This makes sure nothing is missed.

Encourage everyone in your household to adopt this habit. Make it a family chore. A small bowl or jar near the washing machine can serve as a "found treasure" spot. This makes it easy to collect and keep the coins. This simple act is the most effective way to prevent coin damage.

### Use Mesh Laundry Bags for Small Items

Mesh laundry bags are excellent for delicate items. They can also protect your machine from coins. If you are washing items with many small pockets, use a mesh bag. This provides an extra layer of protection. Even if a coin escapes a pocket, it stays in the bag. It cannot then fall into the machine's mechanics.

This is a good practice for things like children's clothes. Small items, like hairpins or loose buttons, also stay contained. [Using mesh bags can also protect clothes from damage](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-washing-machine-damage-clothes). It prevents them from snagging on zippers or buttons.

### Clean the Coin Trap (Filter) Regularly

Many washing machines, especially front-loaders, have a coin trap or filter. This component catches small objects before they reach the pump. It prevents major blockages. You need to clean this trap regularly. The location of the trap varies by model. Check your washing machine's manual for its exact spot.

I suggest checking the coin trap every few months. More frequent laundry requires more frequent checks. Open the small access panel, usually at the bottom front. Unscrew the filter and remove any debris. This simple maintenance step saves your pump. It helps your machine drain efficiently. [Proper maintenance can prevent many issues, similar to how hard water can damage a washing machine over time](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-hard-water-damage-washing-machine).

### Avoid Overloading Your Washing Machine

Overloading the washing machine puts stress on all its parts. This includes the drum and the motor. A heavily loaded machine might not agitate or spin properly. This can make it easier for coins to slip out of pockets. The extra weight also puts more pressure on components if a coin gets jammed.

Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines for load capacity. A good rule of thumb is to leave enough space for your hand to fit comfortably on top of the clothes in the drum. This allows clothes to move freely. It also ensures proper cleaning and protects the machine. If you are unsure about load sizes, refer to your appliance manual or articles on [how full a washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be).

### Consider DIY Washing Machine Maintenance

Learning some basic [do-it-yourself washing machine maintenance](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) can be helpful. This includes regularly inspecting hoses for wear or leaks. You can also check the drum for new scratches or irregularities. Knowing how to access the coin trap is part of this.

These small checks can help you catch problems early. They might prevent a minor issue from becoming a major repair. Being familiar with your machine's components empowers you. It makes you a more informed appliance owner.

## What to Do If You Hear Coins in Your Washing Machine

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a coin might make it into the wash. You might hear strange noises during the cycle. A rattling, clanking, or grinding sound often indicates a foreign object. This is not a time to panic. It is a time to act quickly.

Ignoring these sounds can lead to greater damage. Early intervention can prevent serious problems. I always advise immediate action. This can save you from expensive repairs. It can also prevent complete machine failure.

### Stop the Machine Immediately

If you hear unusual sounds like clanking or grinding, stop the washing machine at once. Do not let it continue the cycle. Press the "cancel" or "pause" button. Then, turn off the power at the wall outlet. This prevents further damage. It also ensures your safety.

Waiting even a few minutes can worsen the problem. A coin bouncing around can quickly damage the drum or pump. Stopping the machine gives you time to assess the situation. It prevents the coin from moving into more critical areas.

### Drain the Water and Open the Door

Once the machine is stopped, you need to drain any standing water. Most modern washing machines have a drain cycle or a manual drain hose. Check your user manual for instructions. Once the water is drained, you can safely open the door.

Carefully inspect the drum. Look for the coin or any visible damage. Feel along the bottom and sides of the drum. Coins sometimes get stuck in the rubber seal around the door of front-loaders. Remove any visible coins immediately.

### Check the Coin Trap (Filter)

If you cannot find the coin in the drum, check the coin trap. As mentioned before, this trap is designed to catch such objects. Place a shallow pan or towel underneath before opening the trap. Water will likely spill out. Carefully unscrew the filter and remove any coins or debris.

This is a very common place for coins to end up. Most of the time, clearing the trap solves the problem. If you find the coin here, clean the trap and reassemble it. Then, run a test cycle with no clothes to ensure it drains properly.

### Inspect Hoses and Underneath the Machine

If the coin is not in the drum or the coin trap, it might have moved further. You might need to inspect the drain hose for blockages. In some cases, the coin might be lodged in the hose itself. Disconnecting the hose and checking can help.

For more complex situations, the coin might be underneath the machine. It might be near the drain pump impeller. This usually requires tilting the machine or removing an access panel. If you are not comfortable with this, call a professional. Just like [shoes can damage washing machines](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-shoes-damage-washing-machines) by getting caught, coins can cause similar internal issues.

## Understanding Your Washing Machine's Vulnerabilities

Not all washing machines are equally vulnerable to coin damage. Different designs have different weak points. Understanding your specific machine type helps you know where to focus your preventative efforts. I have owned both types of machines. I know their quirks.

Knowing the design helps you identify potential trouble spots. This knowledge empowers you to protect your investment better. It lets you be more precise in your inspection and maintenance. Let's look at the differences between common washing machine types.

### Front-Loading Washing Machines

Front-loaders are popular for their efficiency and gentle wash. However, they have a common coin trap area. Coins often get stuck in the rubber gasket or "boot" around the door. This area forms a seal when the door is closed. Small objects can easily fall into this space.

If coins remain in the gasket, they can cause a bad seal. This might lead to leaks. They can also get pushed further into the machine over time. Always check this gasket after each wash cycle. Wipe it clean to prevent mold and remove any foreign objects.

### Top-Loading Washing Machines with Agitators

Older top-loaders often feature a central agitator. This large spindle twists and turns to clean clothes. Coins can easily fall underneath the agitator. Once there, they can rub against the inner tub. This causes scratches and noise.

Removing the agitator to retrieve a coin can be tricky. It often requires specific tools and some disassembly. If you suspect a coin is under the agitator, it might be best to call a technician. Continuous washing with a coin under the agitator will damage both the agitator and the tub.

### Top-Loading Washing Machines with Impellers

Many modern top-loaders use an impeller instead of an agitator. An impeller is a low-profile disc that creates strong currents. This type of machine still has risks. Coins can slip past the impeller and into the drain system. They can also get jammed between the impeller and the drum.

The risk of drum scratching is still present. The main concern shifts more towards pump and drainage issues. Regular cleaning of the coin trap is even more crucial for these models. This helps prevent coins from reaching the pump.

## The Cost of Neglect: Repair Expenses and Machine Lifespan

Ignoring the warning signs or failing to prevent coin damage can be costly. Repairing a washing machine is not always cheap. Sometimes, the damage is so severe that replacement is the only option. I have seen owners regret not checking pockets.

Protecting your washing machine is an investment. It helps you avoid unnecessary expenses. It also ensures your appliance lasts longer. Let's look at the potential financial impact of coin-related damage.

### Repair Costs for Different Components

Repair costs vary widely depending on the damaged part. Here is a general idea:

*   **Drum Scratches:** Minor scratches usually do not require repair. Deep scratches that snag clothes might lead to drum replacement. This is a very expensive repair. It often costs more than a new machine.
*   **Drain Pump Replacement:** This is a common repair. A new drain pump can cost $100-$300 for parts and labor.
*   **Hose Replacement:** A new hose is inexpensive, usually under $50. However, the labor to install it and clean up water damage adds to the cost.
*   **Drive Belt Replacement:** Replacing a drive belt can cost $100-$250, including labor.
*   **Agitator/Impeller Repair:** Parts are often under $100. The labor can add significantly, pushing the total to $150-$300.

These costs add up quickly. They highlight the value of simple prevention.

### Shortened Appliance Lifespan

Every major repair takes a toll on your washing machine. Repeated stress from foreign objects can shorten its overall lifespan. A machine designed to last 10-12 years might only last 5-7 years with poor maintenance. This means you replace it sooner.

Replacing an entire washing machine is a significant expense. The average cost of a new washing machine ranges from $500 to over $1,500. Adding installation and disposal fees makes it even more. Proper care, like checking for coins, keeps your machine running efficiently for its full expected life.

## Beyond Coins: Other Foreign Objects That Damage Washers

Coins are not the only culprits. Many other small items can cause damage to your washing machine. Being aware of these helps you practice better laundry habits. My rule is simple: if it is not fabric or water, it probably should not be in the washer.

Treat all small, hard objects as potential threats. A quick pocket check should cover most of them. Being mindful of what goes into the machine prevents many headaches. It keeps your appliance in top shape.

### Keys, Screws, and Paperclips

These metal items pose similar risks to coins. Keys are often forgotten in pockets. They can scratch drums or get caught in the drain pump. Small screws or paperclips can lodge in small crevices. They can damage delicate parts or puncture hoses.

Always empty pockets of all items. Create a designated spot for keys and other pocket contents. This habit helps keep them out of the washer.

### Buttons, Zippers, and Embellishments

While attached to clothes, loose buttons or broken zippers can cause problems. If a button comes off, it can become a free-moving projectile. Sharp zipper teeth can scratch the drum if they are not properly closed. Embellishments like sequins or beads can also detach.

Turn clothes with zippers inside out. Fasten all zippers and buttons before washing. Use mesh bags for highly embellished items. This protects both the machine and your clothing.

### Hairpins and Bobby Pins

These small, sharp metal objects are notorious for causing issues. They can slip through drum holes easily. They can then get tangled in the pump impeller. They can also scratch the drum or snag clothes.

Always remove hairpins or bobby pins from hair accessories or clothing. A small magnetic dish near the laundry area can help collect them. This prevents them from entering the washing machine.

### Pet Hair and Lint

While not "foreign objects" in the same sense, excessive pet hair and lint can cause problems. They can build up in the drain filter or pump. This reduces drainage efficiency. Over time, it can contribute to blockages.

Brush pets regularly. Consider using lint traps or pet hair removers in the wash. Clean your washing machine's lint trap (if it has one) and coin trap often. This maintains good drainage.

## FAQ Section

### How often should I check my washing machine's coin trap?
I recommend checking your washing machine's coin trap every two to three months. If you do laundry frequently, or if your family often forgets to check pockets, more frequent checks are better. This simple maintenance step prevents clogs and protects your drain pump from damage.

### Can coins damage both front-loader and top-loader washing machines?
Yes, coins can damage both types of washing machines. Front-loaders often see coins stuck in the rubber door gasket or drain pump. Top-loaders risk coins getting trapped under the agitator or impeller. Both designs are vulnerable to scratched drums and clogged drainage systems.

### What are the signs of coin damage in a washing machine?
Common signs of coin damage include unusual noises during cycles, such as clanking, grinding, or rattling. You might also notice poor drainage, water leaks, or clothes not getting clean. Scratches on the drum or a machine that stops mid-cycle are also indicators of a foreign object issue.

### Is it expensive to repair coin damage to a washing machine?
Repair costs vary based on the extent of the damage. Replacing a drain pump or drive belt can cost $100-$300. If the main drum is severely scratched or damaged, replacement can be very expensive, sometimes more than a new machine. Simple prevention is much cheaper than any repair.

### Should I call a professional if a coin is stuck in my washer?
If you cannot locate and remove the coin from the drum or coin trap yourself, calling a professional is wise. Forcing access or disassembling parts incorrectly can cause more damage. A technician has the tools and expertise to safely remove the object and inspect for further issues.

### Can I run a washing machine without clothes to flush out a coin?
Running an empty wash cycle might dislodge a coin, but it also risks moving the coin into a more critical area. It is better to stop the machine, drain the water, and try to locate the coin manually first. An empty cycle might simply cause more wear if the coin is already stuck somewhere problematic.
