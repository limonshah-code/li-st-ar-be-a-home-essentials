## Understanding Your DeWalt Air Compressor’s Controls

Before you can properly turn off your DeWalt air compressor, you need to know its main controls. DeWalt air compressors, like many power tools, feature simple, intuitive designs. Most models include a power switch, a pressure regulator, and a tank drain valve. Knowing what each control does helps you operate the unit safely and efficiently.

The power switch is typically a toggle or a push button, clearly labeled “On/Off.” This switch controls the flow of electricity to the compressor's motor. When you switch it off, the motor stops running and ceases to build pressure. However, switching off the motor does not release the compressed air already inside the tank.

A pressure regulator allows you to control the outgoing air pressure for your tools. It does not directly affect the shutdown process but is important for understanding the system's function. The tank drain valve is a small valve located at the bottom of the air tank. This valve is crucial for releasing residual air and moisture during shutdown. Familiarize yourself with these parts before proceeding with any operation or shutdown procedure.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Turning Off Your DeWalt Compressor

Turning off your DeWalt air compressor requires a sequence of actions beyond simply flipping a switch. Following these steps ensures safety and prepares your unit for storage or future use. I find this process simple once you understand each part's purpose. This guide works for most DeWalt models.

First, stop the compressor's motor. Locate the "On/Off" switch, which is usually a red button or a prominent lever. Push or flip this switch to the "Off" position. This action stops the compressor from building more air pressure. The motor will stop running immediately, but the tank will still contain compressed air.

Next, disconnect the power supply. Unplug the power cord from the wall outlet or extension cord. This step completely removes electrical power from the unit. It prevents accidental startup and removes any electrical hazard. Do not skip this step, even if the motor has stopped running.

Now, you need to release the air pressure from the tank. You can do this by opening the drain valve at the bottom of the tank. Slowly turn the valve counter-clockwise to let the air escape. You will hear a hissing sound as the air exits. Continue until the tank pressure gauge reads zero.

### Depressurizing the Air Tank

Depressurizing the air tank is a critical step in the shutdown process. Ignoring this step can create a safety hazard, as compressed air can cause injury. It also puts unnecessary stress on the tank and components over time. Always ensure the tank is empty of pressure before storage.

To begin depressurizing, ensure the compressor's power is off and unplugged. Locate the tank drain valve at the bottom of the air tank. It often looks like a small petcock or a turn-style valve. Slowly open this valve. This releases the pressurized air in a controlled manner.

You will hear the air rushing out of the tank. Continue to let the air escape until the pressure gauge reads zero. If you do not have an air tool attached, or if you prefer a faster method, you can connect an air tool to the quick connect fitting and depress the trigger. This method expels the air quickly through the tool's nozzle. Remember, safety is paramount during this step.

## Draining Condensate from the Air Tank

Draining condensate is an often-overlooked but vital part of air compressor maintenance. Air contains moisture, and as the compressor compresses air, this moisture condenses into liquid water inside the tank. If this water accumulates, it can cause rust and corrosion, damaging the tank from the inside out. Regular draining prevents this damage and ensures the longevity of your DeWalt air compressor.

After depressurizing the tank, leave the drain valve open. Tilt the compressor slightly if possible to help all the water escape. You will see water, often discolored, spray out along with the remaining air. This is normal and indicates that moisture was present in the tank. Continue until no more water comes out.

This step extends the life of your air tank significantly. It also prevents rust particles from entering your air tools. I make it a habit to drain the tank after every use, or at least weekly, depending on how often I use my compressor.
