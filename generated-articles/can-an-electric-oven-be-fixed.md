## Understanding Your Electric Oven: Basic Principles

Before we dive into repairs, it helps to understand how your electric oven works. Electric ovens convert electricity into heat. They use various components to achieve and maintain the desired temperature. Knowing these parts helps you identify problems.

Electric ovens typically have a bake element at the bottom and a broil element at the top. These elements glow red when they heat up. A thermostat or temperature sensor monitors the internal oven temperature. It sends signals to the control board. The control board then turns the heating elements on or off. This process keeps your oven at the set temperature. A fan in convection ovens circulates hot air. This provides more even cooking. Understanding these basics makes troubleshooting simpler. You will know what parts might be causing a problem. You will also know how they contribute to your oven's overall function. This knowledge forms the foundation for any repair attempt.

### How Does an Electric Oven Heat Up?

An electric oven heats up through its heating elements. When you set a temperature, electricity flows to the bake and/or broil elements. These elements resist the electrical flow. This resistance generates heat. The elements get hot and radiate heat into the oven cavity. A temperature sensor inside the oven measures the air temperature. It sends this information to the oven's control board. The control board then cycles the heating elements on and off. This keeps the oven at the precise temperature you set.
