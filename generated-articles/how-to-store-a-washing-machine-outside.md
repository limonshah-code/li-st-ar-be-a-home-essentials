### Why Store a Washing Machine Outside? Understanding the Need

Sometimes, keeping a washing machine indoors is not an option. You might be renovating your home and need to clear out utility spaces. Maybe you lack a dedicated laundry room and seek a temporary solution for your appliance. For some, outdoor storage offers a way to free up valuable indoor square footage. This approach also helps if you have a second washing machine that you only use seasonally.

Storing your washing machine outside is possible, but it requires careful planning. You cannot just leave it exposed to the elements. Without proper protection, your appliance will quickly degrade. The goal is to create an environment that mimics indoor storage conditions as much as possible. This means shielding it from rain, sun, extreme temperatures, and curious wildlife. Many people ask, [can you keep a washing machine outside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-keep-washing-machine-outside)? The answer is yes, with the right steps.

Understanding *why* you need to store it outside helps define the duration and type of protection needed. A short-term solution for a week or two might be simpler than a long-term strategy for several months or a year. Always consider the local climate. Areas with harsh winters or intense summers demand more robust protective measures. Your washing machine is an investment, and protecting it during outdoor storage is key to its longevity.

### Essential Preparations Before Outdoor Storage

Before moving your washing machine outside, a series of crucial preparation steps are necessary. This prevents damage and ensures the machine remains functional when you bring it back inside. Skipping these steps can lead to costly repairs or even render the appliance unusable. Proper preparation sets the foundation for successful outdoor storage.

First, you must thoroughly clean your washing machine. Remove any detergent residue, fabric softener buildup, or lint from the dispenser, drum, and seals. [Cleaning your washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine) prevents mold and mildew growth during storage. A dirty machine provides an ideal breeding ground for these issues. Run a cleaning cycle with white vinegar or a specialized washing machine cleaner. This eliminates lingering odors and unseen grime. This is also important to understand [why clean a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-clean-washing-machine) at all.

Second, draining all water from the machine is critical. Water left inside can freeze in cold temperatures, causing pipes and pumps to crack. Disconnect both the hot and cold water supply hoses. Tilt the machine gently to drain any remaining water from the inlet hoses. Next, locate the drain pump filter, usually at the bottom front of the machine. Open it carefully and allow any trapped water to drain into a shallow pan. This step is perhaps the most important for preventing winter damage. After draining, leave the drain filter cap slightly ajar. This allows air circulation and prevents moisture buildup.

Finally, secure all moving parts and components. Use the original shipping bolts if you still have them, especially for front-load washers, to lock the drum in place. If not, use towels or foam padding to stabilize the drum and prevent it from shifting during transport. Secure the power cord by wrapping it neatly and tying it off. You want to prevent it from dragging or getting damaged. Close the detergent dispenser drawer and secure the door latch. These careful preparations protect your machine from internal and external harm.

*   **Cleaning Steps:**
    *   Wipe down the drum and seals with a damp cloth.
    *   Clean the detergent dispenser.
    *   Run a hot wash cycle with vinegar or a machine cleaner.
*   **Draining Steps:**
    *   Disconnect water inlet hoses and drain.
    *   Access and drain the pump filter.
    *   Leave filter cap slightly open for air.
*   **Securing Components:**
    *   Install shipping bolts if available.
    *   Pad the drum to prevent movement.
    *   Secure the power cord.
    *   Ensure all doors and drawers are closed.

### Choosing the Right Location for Your Outdoor Washer

Selecting the proper outdoor location is vital for safeguarding your washing machine. The right spot minimizes exposure to harsh weather and offers some natural protection. A poorly chosen location can lead to rapid deterioration of your appliance. Think about factors like sunlight, precipitation, wind, and ground stability.

First, prioritize a sheltered spot. An ideal location is under a covered patio, a carport, or a sturdy lean-to. These structures provide overhead protection from direct rain, snow, and intense sunlight. Direct sunlight, especially UV rays, can cause the plastic components to become brittle and fade. It can also dry out rubber seals, leading to cracks. Rain and snow introduce moisture, which causes rust and electrical component damage. If no covered area is available, you must provide a strong, dedicated cover for the machine itself.

Next, ensure the ground is level and stable. A washing machine is heavy and needs a firm, flat surface to sit on. Uneven ground can stress the machine's internal components and outer casing. It also makes the machine prone to tipping over, which is a significant safety hazard. Avoid placing the machine directly on dirt or grass. These surfaces retain moisture, promoting rust and attracting pests. Instead, use a concrete slab, patio pavers, or a treated wooden platform. Elevating the machine helps further.

Consider accessibility for periodic checks and eventual retrieval. You want a location that is easy to reach without too much effort. This makes it simpler to inspect the machine or move it back indoors. Also, think about any nearby electrical outlets if you plan on occasionally plugging it in to run a cycle for maintenance. However, ensure any electrical connections are strictly weatherproof and up to code. Do not risk electrical hazards.

Finally, place the machine away from areas where water tends to pool or collect. This includes low-lying parts of your yard or near leaky gutters. Standing water is a direct threat to any outdoor appliance. Your location choice creates the first line of defense for your washing machine.

### Weatherproofing Your Washing Machine for Outdoor Elements

Once you have selected a good location, the next critical step is to weatherproof your washing machine. This involves creating a protective barrier against moisture, temperature extremes, and UV radiation. Effective weatherproofing is the difference between a damaged appliance and one ready for use later. Do not skip this crucial phase.

The most essential item for weatherproofing is a heavy-duty, waterproof cover. This cover must fit snugly over the entire machine, reaching down to the base. Look for covers made from durable, UV-resistant materials like thick vinyl or polyester with a waterproof backing. These materials repel water, block sun damage, and offer some insulation against temperature fluctuations. Avoid thin, flimsy covers that can tear easily or let moisture seep through. Securing the cover with bungee cords or built-in straps prevents it from blowing away in windy conditions. Many people use similar principles when they [store patio furniture outside in winter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-store-patio-furniture-outside-in-winter).

Elevating the washing machine off the ground is another vital step. Placing it directly on concrete or soil exposes it to ground moisture, which can cause rust from the bottom up. Use sturdy wooden pallets, concrete blocks, or specialized appliance risers. These lift the machine several inches off the surface, allowing air to circulate underneath. This air circulation helps prevent condensation and keeps the base dry. Ensure the platform is larger than the machine's footprint for stability.

In colder climates, consider adding insulation inside the cover. A layer of foam board or heavy blankets tucked under the waterproof cover provides an extra thermal barrier. This helps protect internal components from freezing temperatures. It minimizes the risk of cracking hoses or pumps. However, ensure any insulation does not trap moisture. The goal is to keep the machine dry and stable.

If you plan for very long-term outdoor storage, you might also consider building a simple, temporary enclosure around the machine. This could be a small wooden shed or a structure with tarps and a frame. This adds another layer of protection from all angles, offering superior defense against the elements. This is similar to strategies people use to [store a washing machine long-term](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-store-a-washing-machine-long-term).

### Protecting Against Pests and Vermin

Storing your washing machine outside means you need to guard it against unwelcome guests. Pests and vermin, like rodents, insects, and spiders, can cause significant damage. They might chew through wires, build nests, or leave droppings. This can lead to electrical failures, blockages, or hygiene issues. Protecting your appliance from these creatures is as important as protecting it from the weather.

Start by sealing any entry points on the washing machine itself. Look for small gaps or openings, especially at the back where hoses and electrical cords enter. Use steel wool or mesh screens to block these openings. Rodents cannot chew through steel wool. Ensure the cover you use fits tightly around the base. This prevents pests from crawling up from underneath. A loose-fitting cover is an open invitation for small animals.

Next, keep the area around the washing machine clean and clear. Remove any debris, leaves, or overgrown plants that could serve as hiding spots for pests. Trim grass and weeds regularly around the storage area. A tidy environment is less attractive to rodents and insects. You do not want to provide a cozy home for them near your appliance.

Consider using natural pest deterrents. Peppermint oil, for instance, is a strong deterrent for mice and other rodents. Place cotton balls soaked in peppermint oil around the base of the machine and inside the cover. Replace them every few weeks. Mothballs can also deter pests, but they have a strong odor. Use them sparingly and ensure ventilation when you eventually remove the machine. Traps can be an option if you observe signs of pest activity.

Finally, conduct periodic inspections. Even with all protective measures, pests can sometimes find their way in. Lift the cover and check for any signs of droppings, nests, or gnaw marks. The sooner you identify a pest problem, the easier it is to address. If you notice any damage, resolve it immediately. This diligence ensures your washing machine remains clean and undamaged inside.

### Long-Term Outdoor Storage Considerations

If you plan to store your washing machine outside for an extended period, specific considerations become even more critical. Long-term storage demands a higher level of protection and more frequent attention. This prevents unforeseen issues and preserves the machine's condition for future use. My goal is to ensure your appliance is ready when you need it again.

One key aspect is regular maintenance and checks. Even with the best preparation, things can shift or degrade over time. Aim to inspect your washing machine at least once every three months. Lift the cover and check for any moisture intrusion, condensation, or signs of pest activity. Look for any cracks in hoses or deterioration of the power cord. Address any issues promptly. This proactive approach helps catch minor problems before they become major repairs.

Consider adding desiccants inside the machine, especially in humid climates. Desiccants like silica gel packets absorb moisture from the air. Place several large packets inside the drum and detergent dispenser. This helps prevent rust and mold growth on internal components. Ensure the machine is completely dry before adding them. Replace the desiccants periodically, as they lose effectiveness once saturated.

Protect the machine from extreme temperature swings. While covers help, rapid changes in temperature can still cause condensation. If possible, choose a storage location that offers some thermal stability. A north-facing wall might be cooler in summer, for instance. For very cold winters, ensure the insulation discussed earlier is robust. You want to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, which are particularly damaging to materials.

Before putting the machine back into service, perform a thorough inspection and a test run. Look for any residual moisture or foreign objects. Run a short cycle with just water and a cleaning agent to flush out any dust or dormant mold. Check for leaks from hoses or the drain pump. This ensures the machine is clean and ready for laundry. These steps are similar to how you would prepare other large appliances, such as when you [clean a refrigerator outside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-refrigerator-outside) after it has been stored.

### Safety Precautions for Outdoor Appliance Storage

Storing a washing machine outside introduces several safety concerns that you must address. Appliances are heavy, contain electrical components, and can become hazards if not properly secured. Your safety, and the safety of others, depends on taking these precautions seriously. Neglecting safety can lead to accidents or injuries.

First, ensure the washing machine is completely disconnected from any power source. The power cord should be unplugged and secured. Never leave an appliance plugged in outdoors, even if it is covered. This poses a severe electrocution risk, especially in wet conditions. Even a small amount of moisture can create a dangerous short circuit. If you must have power nearby for occasional use, use a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet and a heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cord. However, for storage, it is best to unplug entirely.

Second, prevent tipping hazards. A washing machine is top-heavy, especially during transport or if placed on an unstable surface. Make sure the machine sits on a firm, level platform. If your storage area has any slope, shim the platform to create a truly level base. If children or pets are in the area, consider securing the machine further. You can use straps or anchors to a nearby wall or sturdy post. This is particularly important in windy areas.

Third, protect the power cord and hoses from damage. Pests can chew through cords, or they can degrade from sun exposure. Wrap the power cord tightly and store it in a protective conduit or a heavy-duty plastic bag. Keep hoses away from sharp edges or heavy objects that could crush them. Damaged cords are fire hazards; damaged hoses can lead to leaks.

Finally, consider the weight of the machine when moving it. Washing machines are very heavy. Always use appropriate lifting techniques, dollies, and assistance. Do not attempt to move it alone if you are unsure. Injury can easily occur. Before moving, ensure all internal components are secured as discussed in the preparation section. This prevents internal damage during transit. By following these safety rules, you protect both the machine and yourself.
