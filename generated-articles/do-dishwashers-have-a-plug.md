Hardwiring should always be done by a licensed electrician. This ensures safety and compliance. Mistakes in electrical wiring can be dangerous.

## Identifying Your Dishwasher's Connection Type

When you buy a new dishwasher or check an existing one, knowing its power connection is key. It helps you prepare for installation or understand its current setup. This process is straightforward. I have done this many times myself. It just requires a few simple checks.

First, always check the owner's manual. This document is your best friend for any appliance. It clearly states whether the dishwasher is designed for plug-in or hardwired installation. It will also specify the electrical requirements. If you do not have the manual, do not worry. There are other ways to tell.

### Visual Inspection for Plug-In Models

If your dishwasher is a plug-in model, it will have a visible power cord. This cord usually extends from the back of the appliance. It will end in a three-prong grounded plug.

*   **Look behind the kick plate:** Sometimes, the cord and plug are tucked away behind the lower front panel (kick plate) of the dishwasher. You might need to remove a few screws to access this area.
*   **Check the adjacent cabinet:** The power outlet for a plug-in dishwasher is often located in the cabinet next to the dishwasher. The cord runs through a cutout in the cabinet wall to reach it. Open the cabinet door and look inside.
*   **Follow the cord:** If you can see the cord, follow its path. Does it lead to an outlet? If yes, it is a plug-in model.

### Visual Inspection for Hardwired Models

For hardwired dishwashers, you will not find a plug. The electrical connection is more subtle.

*   **Look for a junction box:** Instead of a cord, you will see a small metal or plastic box attached to the back of the dishwasher. This is the junction box. Electrical wires from your home's circuit run into this box and connect directly to the dishwasher's wiring.
*   **Inspect the wire entry point:** You might see a flexible metal conduit or just individual wires entering the back of the appliance. These wires go directly into the junction box.
*   **Check behind the kick plate (again):** Even hardwired units might have their junction box accessible from the front, behind the kick plate. This is for easier service.

Remember, if you are unsure or uncomfortable performing these checks, call a qualified technician. Safety around electricity is paramount. Misidentifying the connection type can lead to installation errors or electrical hazards.
