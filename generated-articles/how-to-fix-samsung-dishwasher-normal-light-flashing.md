This type of signal is meant to alert you before further damage occurs.

## Essential First Steps: Power Reset and Door Latch Check

Before diving into complex diagnostics, always start with the simplest solutions. A quick power reset can often resolve temporary glitches in your Samsung dishwasher. Appliances can sometimes experience minor electronic hiccups. Turning the power off and then back on effectively reboots the control system, clearing any minor errors.

### Performing a Power Reset

This step is straightforward and requires minimal effort. I always start here when any appliance acts strange. It can save you a lot of time and worry.

*   **Locate your circuit breaker:** Find the breaker switch that controls power to your kitchen or specifically your dishwasher.
*   **Turn off the power:** Flip the breaker switch to the "off" position.
*   **Wait for a few minutes:** Let the dishwasher remain without power for at least 5-10 minutes. This ensures all residual electricity drains from the system.
*   **Restore power:** Flip the breaker switch back to the "on" position.
*   **Check the dishwasher:** See if the Normal light is still flashing. If not, try starting a cycle to confirm the fix.

A power reset is often the first thing technicians suggest. It resolves many common electronic issues. If your Samsung dishwasher is not turning on at all, a power reset can also be a helpful first step for that problem, as discussed in detail here: [why your Samsung dishwasher is not turning on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-not-turning-on). This simple action can sometimes clear a stuck sensor reading or a minor software bug.

### Checking the Door Latch

A surprisingly common reason for a flashing Normal light is an improperly closed door. The dishwasher will not start a cycle if it senses the door is open. This is a safety feature to prevent water leaks.

*   **Open and re-close the door:** Firmly push the door shut until you hear a click. Sometimes a gentle nudge is not enough.
*   **Inspect the latch mechanism:** Look at the latch on the dishwasher's body and the strike plate on the door. Ensure nothing blocks them.
*   **Check for damage:** Look for bent metal or broken plastic on the latch components. If parts are damaged, they may need replacement.
*   **Test the seal:** Make sure the door gasket (seal) is clean and flexible. A stiff or dirty gasket can prevent a proper seal.

A faulty door latch can also cause other related issues, such as the dishwasher flashing Normal and refusing to turn off, as detailed in this resource: [why your Samsung dishwasher is flashing Normal and won't turn off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-flashing-normal-and-wont-turn-off). Always ensure the door is fully engaged. The dishwasher's control system needs to confirm a secure closure before it allows any operation.

## Investigating Water Supply and Drain Issues

Your Samsung dishwasher needs a steady supply of water to operate and a clear path to drain it. Problems with either can cause the Normal light to flash. The dishwasher's sensors detect issues with water intake or expulsion. If it cannot fill or drain correctly, it stops the cycle and signals an error.

### Checking Water Supply

The first step is to ensure water is reaching the dishwasher. I often forget to check the simple things, like the water valve.

*   **Verify the water shut-off valve:** Locate the hot water shut-off valve under your kitchen sink. Make sure it is fully open. It should be parallel to the water pipe for full flow.
*   **Inspect the water inlet hose:** Look for any kinks or bends in the hose connected to the back of the dishwasher. Straighten any kinks you find.
*   **Check water pressure:** If other water fixtures in your home have low pressure, it might be a general house plumbing issue. Low water pressure can prevent the dishwasher from filling adequately.
*   **Clean the inlet screen:** Sometimes, debris can clog a small screen at the water inlet valve connection. Turn off the water supply, disconnect the hose, and clean any collected particles.

Insufficient water can trigger the Normal light to flash. The dishwasher expects a certain amount of water within a specific time. If it does not get enough, it registers an error.

### Addressing Drainage Problems

After a wash cycle, dirty water must drain away. If the water cannot exit, the dishwasher will stop and signal a problem. This often leads to a flashing Normal light.

*   **Inspect the drain hose:** Check the drain hose, typically connected to your sink's drain or garbage disposal. Ensure it is not kinked or crushed.
*   **Look for clogs in the air gap (if present):** Some installations include an air gap on the sink top. Remove the cap and check for food debris.
*   **Clean the drain filter:** This is one of the most common causes of drainage issues. Food particles, grease, and debris accumulate in the filter, blocking water flow.
    *   Locate the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.
    *   Twist and remove the cylindrical mesh filter and the fine filter beneath it.
    *   Rinse them thoroughly under running water, using a brush if necessary to remove stubborn debris.
    *   Reinstall them correctly, ensuring they lock into place.
    *   If you need help finding the filter, this guide can help: [where is the filter in a Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-filter-in-samsung-dishwasher).
*   **Check the drain pump:** If the filters are clean and the hose is clear, the drain pump might be obstructed or faulty. Turn off power, remove the filters, and visually inspect the pump impeller area for debris. You may need to remove the drain pump for a thorough check, which might require professional help.

Proper drainage is essential for any dishwasher. A blockage can quickly lead to a flashing light and an incomplete cycle. Clearing these clogs is a common and effective DIY repair.

## Checking Sensors and Internal Components

Beyond basic resets and water flow, internal sensors and components play a crucial role in your dishwasher's operation. When these parts malfunction or give incorrect readings, they can cause the Normal light to flash. Your Samsung dishwasher uses various sensors to monitor conditions like water level and temperature.

### Flood Sensor Activation

Samsung dishwashers include a flood sensor, also known as a water level sensor. This sensor is a safety device designed to detect leaks or overfilling. If it senses water in the drip pan at the bottom of the dishwasher, it activates to prevent flooding. This immediately stops the cycle and often triggers the flashing Normal light.

*   **Locate the flood sensor:** It is usually a small float switch located in the base pan underneath the dishwasher tub.
*   **Check for standing water:** Pull the dishwasher out slightly and look underneath for any standing water in the drip pan.
*   **Dry the pan:** If water is present, carefully dry it up with towels or a sponge. You might need to tilt the dishwasher gently to drain water from the pan. Be careful not to damage internal components.
*   **Inspect the float switch:** Ensure the float moves freely. Sometimes, debris can get stuck under it, causing it to remain in an activated (up) position even if there's no water. Clean around it if needed.

A false activation of the flood sensor, or an actual leak, will cause this error. Addressing any detected leaks is crucial to prevent further damage. If your dishwasher is showing an "over-level water error," this flood sensor is often the culprit, and you can find more specific guidance on that issue here: [how to fix Samsung dishwasher over-level water error](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-samsung-dishwasher-over-level-water-error).

### Heating Element and Thermostat Issues

The heating element ensures your water reaches the correct temperature for effective cleaning and drying. The thermostat monitors this temperature. If the dishwasher cannot heat the water, or if the thermostat gives a faulty reading, the cycle will not complete. This can also cause the Normal light to flash.

*   **Check for warm dishes/steam:** After a cycle, if dishes are cold or not dry, it might indicate a heating issue.
*   **Inspect the element:** Visually check the heating element at the bottom of the tub for any visible damage or corrosion. This requires careful inspection.
*   **Test with a multimeter (advanced):** For precise diagnosis, you can use a multimeter to check the continuity of the heating element and the thermostat. This step requires electrical knowledge and safety precautions. If there is no continuity, the part is likely faulty.

A broken heating element or thermostat means the dishwasher cannot reach the proper operating temperature. This directly impacts cleaning performance and can halt the cycle.

### Pressure Switch Problems

The pressure switch monitors the water level inside the tub during filling. It tells the control board when enough water has entered. If this switch malfunctions, it might incorrectly signal that there is too much or too little water, leading to a flashing Normal light.

*   **Locate the pressure switch:** This switch is usually connected by a small air tube to the bottom of the dishwasher tub.
*   **Check the air tube:** Ensure the air tube is clear of clogs or kinks. Sometimes, soap residue or food particles can block this tube, affecting the pressure reading.
*   **Test switch continuity (advanced):** Similar to the thermostat, a multimeter can check the pressure switch's operation. This confirms if the switch is opening and closing correctly as water levels change.

A faulty pressure switch can cause the dishwasher to either overfill or underfill, leading to an error. This sensor is crucial for the dishwasher's automated water management.

## Advanced Troubleshooting and Component Replacement

If the basic checks and simple fixes do not resolve the flashing Normal light, the problem might lie with more complex internal components. These issues might require a deeper dive into the dishwasher's mechanics or even part replacement. While some advanced steps can be DIY, others are best left to a professional technician.

### Checking the Circulation Pump

The circulation pump is responsible for moving water through the spray arms to clean the dishes. If this pump is faulty or obstructed, water will not spray properly, and the dishwasher might detect an issue, leading to the Normal light flashing.

*   **Listen for pump sounds:** During a wash cycle, listen for unusual noises like grinding or humming from the pump area. A silent pump might indicate it is not running.
*   **Inspect for blockages:** Turn off power. You might need to remove the spray arms and internal filters to access the pump impeller area. Look for food debris, broken glass, or small foreign objects that could jam the impeller.
*   **Test pump motor (advanced):** If you are comfortable with electrical testing, you can use a multimeter to check for continuity in the pump motor windings. A lack of continuity indicates a faulty motor.

A non-functioning circulation pump means water cannot be sprayed onto the dishes effectively. This makes it impossible for the dishwasher to perform its primary function.

### Examining the Main Control Board

The main control board acts as the "brain" of your Samsung dishwasher. It receives signals from all sensors and sends commands to various components. If this board malfunctions, it can send incorrect signals or fail to process correct ones, leading to arbitrary errors like a flashing Normal light.

*   **Look for visible damage:** With the power off, carefully inspect the control board for any burnt components, discolored spots, or corroded connections. These are signs of board failure.
*   **Reset the board:** Sometimes, a complete power cycle (as described earlier) can reset minor glitches in the control board.
*   **Consider replacement:** If all other components test well and no other issues are found, a faulty control board is a strong possibility. Replacing the main control board is a complex and often expensive repair. It usually requires specific technical skills and the correct replacement part.

A faulty control board is often a last resort diagnosis. It is crucial to rule out all other potential causes before replacing this expensive component. This is similar to troubleshooting other electronic issues, such as dealing with a specific error code like the [LC code on a Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-samsung-dishwasher-with-lc-code), where the control board might also be involved.

### Dealing with Error Codes

Sometimes, the flashing Normal light might be accompanied by a specific error code on the dishwasher's display. These codes provide more precise diagnostic information.

*   **Consult your manual:** Your Samsung dishwasher's user manual will have a list of error codes and what they mean. This is your best resource for decoding specific issues.
*   **Research the code:** If you do not have the manual, a quick online search for "Samsung dishwasher [error code] Normal light flashing" can yield helpful results.
*   **Address the specific code:** Follow the troubleshooting steps specific to that error code. For example, an "OE" code usually points to an overflow issue, while an "LE" code indicates a leakage problem.

Understanding error codes helps you pinpoint the exact fault. This avoids guesswork and allows for more targeted repairs.
