## Build Your Perfect Corner Desk with Two Desks

Are you tired of cramped workspaces? Does your current desk feel too small for all your gear? Imagine having ample space to spread out, organize your essentials, and boost your productivity. Creating a corner desk from two separate desks is a clever way to achieve this.

This DIY project helps you maximize your room's layout and create an efficient L-shaped workstation. Learning **how to make a corner desk with two desks** gives you a custom solution without the high cost of custom furniture. This guide will walk you through planning, selecting your desks, the assembly process, and adding those vital finishing touches. Get ready to transform your office space into a highly functional area.

### Takeaway:

*   **Plan Carefully:** Measure your space and select two desks that complement each other in size and style.
*   **Secure Connections:** Use sturdy brackets and screws to join the desks and any corner piece.
*   **Enhance Functionality:** Integrate cable management, storage, and proper lighting for a productive setup.
*   **Maintain Regularly:** Keep your new workspace clean and check connections for long-lasting stability.

You can easily make a corner desk with two desks by choosing desks of similar height and style. Position them in an L-shape and secure them together using brackets or a custom-cut corner piece. This creates a larger, more efficient workspace.

## Why Combine Desks for a Corner Workspace?

Combining two desks into a corner setup offers many benefits. It is a smart way to use neglected corner space in any room. This method provides a much larger surface area than a single desk. I found this particularly helpful in my smaller office, freeing up valuable wall space.

An L-shaped configuration helps you spread out your work. You can have a dedicated area for your computer and another for writing or crafting. This separation keeps your main workspace clear. This setup also promotes better ergonomics. You can easily pivot between tasks, reducing strain from prolonged sitting in one position.

Using two existing desks can save you money. Buying a brand-new L-shaped desk can be expensive. Repurposing desks you already own or finding affordable used ones is a budget-friendly option. It also allows for more customization than pre-built units. You pick the desks that fit your style and needs.

A tidy environment definitely boosts productivity.

This approach creates a versatile workspace. You can fit multiple monitors, office equipment, and personal items without clutter. The increased surface area makes it ideal for many activities. It provides enough room for both work and creative projects. Thinking about overall comfort, you can also consider how to make your office chair more comfortable, similar to how one might ask [how can I make my sofa better for my back](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-can-i-make-my-sofa-better-for-my-back). Ergonomics matter for any long-term sitting.

## Choosing the Right Desks and Materials

Selecting the right desks is the first critical step for your new corner workstation. Not just any two desks will work well together. I always look for desks that are the same height. This ensures a seamless transition across the L-shape. Different heights will create an uneven surface and look awkward.

Consider the material and style of the desks. Matching wood tones or metal finishes creates a cohesive look. You can also mix materials for a unique design, but make sure they complement each other. Two identical desks offer the most straightforward path. If you are repurposing items, like [how to make a kitchen island out of base cabinets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-a-kitchen-island-out-of-base-cabinets), think about how the materials will blend.

Next, plan your corner connection. This is where the two desks meet at a right angle. You can use a separate corner piece that bridges the gap. This piece could be a custom-cut desktop section or a pre-made corner unit. Alternatively, you might join the desks directly, creating a smaller "L" where their edges meet. My preferred method is using a custom-cut corner piece, as it provides a larger, uninterrupted surface.

Gather your tools and materials. You will need a drill, screws, and sturdy L-brackets or mending plates. Measuring tape is essential for accurate placement. If you plan to cut a corner piece, you will also need a saw. Sandpaper and wood finish are useful for a professional look on any cut edges. Remember, the right tools make any DIY project easier and safer.

## Planning Your Corner Desk Layout

Careful planning makes all the difference when creating your corner desk. First, measure your available space. You need to know the dimensions of the corner and the length of the walls where the desks will sit. This ensures your chosen desks will fit comfortably. Don't forget to account for walking space around the desk.

Next, decide on the orientation of your L-shape. Will it be a "left L" or a "right L"? This depends on your room layout and personal preference. Think about where your chair will go and how you want to access different parts of the desk. Sketching a simple diagram can help visualize the final setup.

Consider existing room features. Are there windows, outlets, or radiators nearby? Plan your desk placement to avoid blocking these or to ensure easy access to power. My own office has limited outlets, so I made sure one desk was near a power source. This planning step also helps you decide where your computer tower, monitors, and other peripherals will sit.

Think about how you will use the desk daily. Do you need one side for active work and another for storage or a printer? This functional mapping guides your layout decisions. A well-planned layout enhances productivity. It makes your workspace intuitive and pleasant to use. Taking the time now saves frustration later. It is similar to how you might organize thoughts to [make clean notes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-clean-notes); good planning sets the foundation.

## Step-by-Step Assembly Guide

Assembling your corner desk is an exciting part of the project. Start by clearing your workspace. You need enough room to move around both desks. If your desks came flat-packed, assemble them individually first, following their instructions. Make sure all their original parts are secure.

Now, position your two desks in the desired L-shape. Gently push them together into the corner where they will permanently reside. Check that they are level. If one desk is slightly higher or lower, use furniture shims under the feet to equalize their heights. This ensures a smooth, continuous surface.

### Securing the Desks

Once positioned, it's time to connect them. I recommend using sturdy L-brackets or mending plates underneath the desk surfaces. Place these brackets where the desks meet, at the front and back edges. Use screws that are long enough to penetrate both desk frames but not so long they go through the top surface. Drill pilot holes first to prevent splitting the wood.

If your desks have side panels that meet, you can also use screws or small corner braces to join these. This adds extra stability. Make sure all connections are tight. Wobbly desks are a distraction. Ensure your setup is as solid as if you were building [shaker cabinet doors from old flat-fronts](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-shaker-cabinet-doors-from-old-flat-fronts) â€“ precision matters for stability.

### Adding the Corner Piece (Optional but Recommended)

If you chose to use a separate corner piece, position it over the gap where the two desks meet. This piece should span both desks, creating a seamless surface. Secure it to the underlying desks using screws from underneath, or by drilling through the top and countersinking the screws.

You can also use additional L-brackets to attach the corner piece to the frames of the two desks for maximum stability. Make sure the corner piece is flush with the desk surfaces. Sand any rough edges on your custom-cut piece. This attention to detail improves both safety and appearance. Creating a solid connection is key. It provides a larger, unified workspace, much like how a well-built structure provides a strong foundation.

## Enhancing Functionality and Aesthetics

Once your corner desk is assembled, it is time to make it truly yours. Think about how to enhance its functionality and visual appeal. Good cable management is a must for any modern workspace. Nothing ruins the look of a clean desk like a tangle of wires. Use cable ties, cable sleeves, or adhesive cable clips to neatly route power cords and device cables. You can even drill grommet holes into the desk surface for a tidy exit point for cables.

Consider adding extra storage. Desk drawers, monitor stands with built-in storage, or small shelves can keep your workspace organized. Vertical storage solutions are great for maximizing space on your new large desk. I added a small set of drawers under one side of my corner desk, which really helped clear the surface.

Proper lighting is crucial for productivity and eye health. Add a good task lamp that illuminates your work area without causing glare. Consider smart lighting options that let you adjust brightness and color temperature. A well-lit desk makes long hours more comfortable.

Finally, add some personal touches. A [desk mat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-desk-mat) protects your surface and adds a pop of color or texture. Personal photos, plants, or decorative items can make the space feel more inviting. A well-organized and aesthetically pleasing desk can even inspire cleaner habits overall, helping you maintain a tidy workspace. Think about what will help you focus and feel comfortable in your new setup.

## Troubleshooting Common Corner Desk Challenges

Even with careful planning, you might face some challenges. Knowing how to address them helps keep your project on track. One common issue is uneven desks. If one desk sits slightly higher or lower than the other, your surface will not be flush. You can fix this by using furniture shims. Place these thin pieces of wood or plastic under the feet of the lower desk until both surfaces are level. Many desks also have adjustable feet, which makes leveling easier.

Another challenge is a wobbly connection between the two desks. This can happen if the brackets are not strong enough or if the screws are loose. To fix this, first, tighten all existing screws. If it still wobbles, add more L-brackets or mending plates. Use longer, more robust screws, ensuring they do not go through the top surface. Adding a reinforcing piece of wood underneath where the desks join can also provide significant stability.

Sometimes, a small gap can appear where the two desks meet, even after securing them. This might be due to slight imperfections in the desk edges or cuts. For small gaps, you can use wood filler that matches your desk color. After the filler dries, sand it smooth and apply a matching finish. For larger or more visible gaps, a decorative trim piece can be attached along the seam. This not only hides the gap but also adds a finished look to your desk.

Electrical access can also be an issue. If your desks block outlets, consider using a power strip with a long cord. Route the cord neatly using cable management solutions. Investing in a good quality power strip with surge protection is always a smart choice for your electronics. Address these common challenges as they arise to ensure your corner desk is both functional and secure.

## Maintaining Your New Corner Desk

Building your corner desk is a great achievement, and regular maintenance ensures it remains a functional and attractive part of your home. Keeping your desk clean is the first step. Dust your desk regularly with a microfiber cloth to prevent buildup. For spills, wipe them immediately with a damp cloth and mild cleaner. Always use coasters under drinks to protect the surface from rings. For instance, knowing [how to wash a desk mat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-desk-mat) helps keep your immediate workspace clean and hygienic.

Periodically, inspect the connections you made. Over time, screws can loosen from daily use or vibrations. Take a moment every few months to check all the L-brackets, mending plates, and any other connectors. Tighten any loose screws. This simple step prevents wobbling and ensures the long-term stability of your joined desks. A stable desk is safer and more pleasant to work on.

Protecting the desk surfaces is also important. If your desk tops are wood, you might want to reapply a wood conditioner or polish every so often. This keeps the wood looking fresh and prevents drying or cracking. Consider using desk pads or large mouse pads where you do most of your work. These protect the surface from scratches, spills, and general wear and tear.

Lastly, maintain good cable management. Cables can shift and tangle over time. Re-bundle them as needed to keep them tidy and prevent strain on your ports. A clean and organized desk is not just about aesthetics; it also contributes to a more focused and efficient workflow. Just as you might organize your thoughts to [make clean notes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-clean-notes), maintaining your physical workspace contributes to mental clarity.

## FAQ Section

### What type of desks are best for this project?
The best desks are those of similar height and depth. Matching materials or styles ensures a cohesive look. Desks with flat sides that can easily push together are ideal. Avoid desks with complex shapes or built-in drawers that would prevent them from sitting flush.

### Do I need a special corner piece to join the desks?
Not always. You can join two desks directly at their ends, forming a small corner. However, adding a custom-cut corner piece creates a larger, more usable surface area in the corner. This piece bridges the gap and makes the L-shape more functional.

### How do I ensure my combined corner desk is stable?
Use sturdy L-brackets or mending plates to connect the desk frames underneath the surface. Secure them with appropriate screws, drilling pilot holes first. Ensure both desks are level before connecting them. Adding multiple connection points increases stability.

### Can I use desks of different heights for this setup?
It is possible but not ideal. Different heights will create an uneven work surface. This can be uncomfortable and impractical. If you must use different heights, you will need to add shims or adjustable feet to the shorter desk to match the taller one.

### What essential tools will I need for this DIY project?
You will need a measuring tape, a drill, appropriate screws (wood or machine screws depending on desk material), and L-brackets or mending plates. A saw may be necessary if you are custom-cutting a corner piece. Safety glasses are also highly recommended.

### How much space do I need for a corner desk made from two desks?
The exact space needed depends on the size of your chosen desks. Measure the length and width of each desk. Then, calculate the total length along each wall where the L-shape will sit. Remember to leave enough space for your chair and to move around comfortably.

## Conclusion

Creating a corner desk from two individual desks is a rewarding DIY project. It transforms an underutilized corner into a highly functional workspace. This method maximizes your room's potential, provides ample surface area, and can be much more cost-effective than buying a new L-shaped unit. I personally found this a fantastic way to organize my home office.

By carefully planning your layout, selecting suitable desks, and following the assembly steps, you can build a stable and aesthetically pleasing workstation. Don't forget to enhance its functionality with smart organization and proper lighting. Regular maintenance will ensure your new setup serves you well for years to come. Now you know **how to make a corner desk with two desks**, empowering you to create your dream workspace. Gather your materials, clear your space, and begin your project today.
