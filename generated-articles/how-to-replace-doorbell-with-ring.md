This guide will walk you through the process of how to replace doorbell with Ring. We will cover choosing the right Ring model. We will also detail the installation steps for both wired and battery options. You will learn about chime compatibility and app setup. Get ready to enjoy a smarter, safer home entrance.

### Takeaway

Replacing your old doorbell with a Ring device boosts home security and convenience.
*   First, assess your current doorbell wiring to choose the right Ring model.
*   Next, gather necessary tools and ensure power is off for safety.
*   Then, follow specific steps for wired or battery installations.
*   Finally, configure the Ring app and integrate with your existing chime system.

Replacing your old doorbell with a Ring smart doorbell involves evaluating your existing wiring, choosing the correct Ring model (wired or battery), safely disconnecting the old unit, and then installing the new Ring device, followed by simple app setup to activate its features and connect to your home's Wi-Fi.

## Understanding Your Current Doorbell and Ring Options

Before you can replace your doorbell with Ring, you must understand your existing setup. Traditional doorbells typically come in two forms: wired or wireless. Wired doorbells connect to your home's electrical system, usually through low-voltage wiring. Wireless doorbells often run on batteries and communicate via radio frequency. Knowing your type helps you pick the correct Ring device.

Different Ring doorbell models suit various home setups. The Ring Video Doorbell Wired connects directly to existing doorbell wiring. It needs specific voltage requirements, typically 8-24 VAC. The Ring Video Doorbell (battery-powered) is more versatile. It does not require existing wiring, making installation simpler for many. Ring also offers Pro, Pro 2, and other models. These usually need existing wiring and a compatible transformer.

I always recommend checking your current doorbell's voltage. You can find this information on your transformer. It is often located in your basement, garage, or near your electrical panel. Knowing the voltage ensures compatibility with wired Ring models. If your voltage is too low, you might need a transformer upgrade. This step is important for successful installation.

Choosing the right Ring model depends on your comfort with wiring and your home's setup. If you have existing wiring and prefer a continuous power source, a wired Ring model is ideal. If you lack wiring or want the easiest setup, a battery-powered Ring is perfect. Think about your power source preference and installation convenience. This helps you make the best decision for your home security.

## Gathering Your Tools and Preparing for Installation

Preparation is key for any home improvement project. Replacing your doorbell with Ring is no different. First, gather all the tools you will need. Having everything ready saves time and makes the process smoother. You will likely need a Phillips-head screwdriver, a drill with appropriate bits, and possibly wire strippers. Your Ring doorbell package will include some mounting hardware and sometimes even a screwdriver.

Safety is your top priority. Always turn off the power to your doorbell at the circuit breaker before starting. This prevents electrical shocks. I always double-check with a non-contact voltage tester to be sure the power is truly off. It is a quick and simple step that protects you. You can usually find the circuit breaker for your doorbell labeled, or it might be the same one as for your outdoor lights.

Unpack your new Ring doorbell. Check that all components are present. This includes the doorbell unit, mounting bracket, screws, anchors, and any wiring harnesses or jumpers. Read the quick start guide included in the box. Each Ring model might have slightly different installation steps. Familiarize yourself with the specific instructions for your chosen device.

Consider the doorbell's location. The best spot is typically where your old doorbell was. Ensure it has a clear view of your entryway. This helps the motion detection work well. If you are installing a battery-powered Ring without existing wiring, choose a spot with good Wi-Fi signal. Test your Wi-Fi strength near the installation area. A strong signal ensures reliable performance and video quality.

## The Step-by-Step Process for Wired Doorbell Replacement

Replacing a wired doorbell with a Ring device requires careful steps. First, ensure the power is off at the circuit breaker. This is crucial for safety. Next, carefully remove your old doorbell button from the wall. You will usually find two wires connected to it. Disconnect these wires, being careful not to let them fall back into the wall. I always tape them to the wall or use wire nuts to secure them temporarily.

Now, prepare the Ring mounting bracket. Place the bracket against the wall where your old doorbell was. Mark the drill holes. Use a drill to create pilot holes if needed, especially on brick or stucco. Insert the wall anchors if your wall material requires them. Then, secure the mounting bracket to the wall using the provided screws. Make sure it is level for a professional look.

Connect the wires to your Ring doorbell. For most wired Ring models, you will attach one wire to each of the two terminals on the back of the Ring device. The wires do not have a specific positive or negative orientation for these low-voltage connections. Ensure the connections are snug. Avoid overtightening. If your Ring model comes with a diode or a Pro Power Kit, follow its specific instructions for wiring. This step ensures proper power delivery to the Ring device.

Mount the Ring doorbell onto the bracket. Slide the doorbell unit onto the bracket from top to bottom. It should click into place securely. Use the security screw at the bottom of the unit to lock it onto the bracket. This helps prevent theft. Once mounted, turn the power back on at the circuit breaker. Your Ring doorbell should power on and begin its setup process, indicated by a spinning light.
