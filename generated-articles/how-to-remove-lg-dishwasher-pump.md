## Safely Remove Your LG Dishwasher Pump: A Complete Guide

Is your LG dishwasher making strange noises? Is it failing to drain water properly? These issues often point to a problem with the dishwasher's pump. Knowing how to remove an LG dishwasher pump is a valuable skill. It allows you to diagnose problems, clear blockages, or replace a faulty unit.

This guide gives you clear steps to approach this repair. You will learn about the different types of pumps and the tools you need. I will walk you through preparing your dishwasher and safely accessing the pump. Then, we will cover the specific steps to remove both the drain and circulation pumps. By the end, you will feel ready to tackle this common home appliance repair with confidence.

### Takeaway

Removing an LG dishwasher pump is a manageable DIY task. Here are the key steps:

*   **Prioritize Safety:** Always disconnect power and water before starting.
*   **Gather Tools:** Have basic tools like screwdrivers, pliers, and a bucket ready.
*   **Access the Pump:** This involves pulling out the dishwasher and removing the kick plate, bottom spray arm, and filter.
*   **Identify Pump Type:** Determine if you are removing the drain pump or the circulation pump.
*   **Disconnect and Remove:** Carefully detach hoses, wiring, and mounting clips for your specific pump.

To remove an LG dishwasher pump, first unplug the appliance and turn off the water supply. Pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet and remove the kick plate. Next, disconnect hoses and electrical connections from the pump. Release any mounting clips or screws that hold the pump in place, then carefully twist or slide the pump out.

### Understanding Your LG Dishwasher Pump: Why Removal Matters

Your LG dishwasher uses pumps to do its job. It has at least two main pumps. One pump handles the circulation of water during the wash cycle. The other pump handles draining the dirty water away. Problems with either pump can stop your dishwasher from working.

The circulation pump pushes water through the spray arms. This pump ensures dishes get clean. If this pump fails, water might not spray, or it might spray weakly. The drain pump removes water from the tub. If your dishwasher does not drain, this pump is likely the problem. Knowing which pump is faulty helps you focus your repair efforts. Sometimes, a pump only needs a good cleaning. Other times, it needs a full replacement. For issues like a clogged drain pump, you might try to [unblock your LG dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-unblock-lg-dishwasher-pump) before fully removing it.

Diagnosing the issue accurately saves time and money. A pump making loud noises might have a worn motor bearing. A pump that hums but does not move water could have a blockage or a failed impeller. Knowing why you need to remove the pump guides your next steps. Before you remove anything, you might want to [test your LG dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-lg-dishwasher-drain-pump) to confirm it is the source of the problem. This initial diagnosis helps you decide if removal is truly necessary or if another repair is possible.

### Safety First: Preparing Your LG Dishwasher for Service

Safety is the most important step for any appliance repair. Working with water and electricity can be dangerous. Always ensure the dishwasher is completely without power before you touch anything. You do not want any unexpected shocks. Taking time for proper preparation prevents accidents.

First, locate your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. Flip this breaker to the "off" position. This stops electricity flow to the appliance. If you are unsure which breaker it is, turn off the main breaker for your entire home. Next, you need to turn off the water supply. There is usually a shut-off valve under your kitchen sink. It connects to the dishwasher's water inlet hose. Turn this valve clockwise until it is fully closed. This prevents water from flooding your floor.

It is also smart to have towels and a small bucket nearby. Some water will remain inside the dishwasher's pump or hoses. You can use the towels to soak up spills. The bucket helps catch any larger amounts of water. Finally, clear the area around the dishwasher. You need space to pull the appliance out from its cabinet. Sometimes, this also means [removing your LG dishwasher kick plate](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-lg-dishwasher-kick-plate) to gain access to the underside. This preparation makes the removal process safer and easier.

### Gathering Your Tools: What You Need to Remove an LG Dishwasher Pump

Having the right tools makes the job much smoother. You do not need specialized equipment for most dishwasher pump removals. Standard household tools are usually enough. Prepare your workspace by laying out these items before you start. This prevents stops and starts during the repair.

You will need a few basic screwdrivers. A Phillips head screwdriver is essential for most screws. A flathead screwdriver can also be useful for prying or leverage. Pliers are important for disconnecting hose clamps or electrical connectors. Adjustable pliers or slip-joint pliers work well. A pair of channel locks can also be useful for tougher connections. You will likely need a small bucket or pan. This is for catching any remaining water when you disconnect hoses.

A few extra items can also be helpful. A flashlight or headlamp provides better visibility inside the cramped space. Work gloves protect your hands from sharp edges or grime. Safety glasses protect your eyes. A small wrench or nut driver set might be needed for certain bolts. Having these tools ready saves you time. It helps avoid frustration during the removal process.

### Accessing the LG Dishwasher Pump: Step-by-Step Disassembly

Accessing the dishwasher pump requires some disassembly. The pump is usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher, underneath the main tub. You will need to pull the dishwasher out from its spot under the counter. This allows you to work on it from the side or back.

First, remove the lower dish rack from inside the dishwasher. This gives you more room to work inside the tub. Next, locate the bottom spray arm. Most spray arms simply unscrew or unclip from the center. Remove this to gain access to the filter assembly. The filter assembly is typically in the center of the tub's bottom. It often twists counter-clockwise to unlock and lift out. Some models may have a fine mesh screen and a coarser filter cup. Remove all parts of the filter assembly. You may find some debris there, which could be the source of your problem.

After clearing the inside, you must pull the dishwasher out. If your dishwasher has a kick plate, you need to [remove the LG dishwasher kick plate](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-lg-dishwasher-kick-plate) first. This plate is at the bottom front. It hides the leveling legs and electrical connections. Once the kick plate is off, you can often unscrew the mounting brackets that secure the dishwasher to the countertop or cabinet. Then, carefully slide the dishwasher out. Be gentle with the water lines and power cord. You might need to disconnect the drain hose from the sink's air gap or garbage disposal to pull the unit further out.

### Detailed Steps: Removing the LG Dishwasher Drain Pump

The drain pump is typically smaller and connects to the drain hose. It is responsible for pushing dirty water out of the dishwasher. Removing this pump is often necessary for drain issues or if the pump itself is faulty. I have helped many friends with this exact problem. It is usually located at the front or side of the dishwasher's underside.

With the dishwasher pulled out and tilted on its side or back (carefully!), locate the drain pump. It will have a drain hose connected to it. It also has electrical wires. First, disconnect the electrical wiring harness. This usually involves pressing a tab and pulling the connector apart. Next, remove the drain hose. This hose is often held by a spring clamp or screw clamp. Use pliers to squeeze the spring clamp and slide it back, or use a screwdriver to loosen the screw clamp. Then, carefully twist and pull the hose off the pump's outlet. Expect some water to spill, so have your bucket ready.

Once the hose and wires are off, the pump itself is usually held in place by a few screws or a twist-lock mechanism. Look for mounting screws securing it to the sump assembly. If it is a twist-lock, you will turn the pump counter-clockwise to unlock it from the sump. Once released, the pump should pull free. Inspect the old pump for any blockages or damage. If you suspect a blockage, you might consider how to [clean the dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-pump) after removal. If you're replacing it, take note of its orientation. For replacement, you will simply reverse these steps. You can often learn how to [replace an LG dishwasher pump motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-dishwasher-pump-motor) if the motor is the sole issue, rather than replacing the whole pump.

### Detailed Steps: Removing the LG Dishwasher Circulation Pump

The circulation pump is generally larger than the drain pump. It sits more centrally under the dishwasher tub. This pump moves water through the wash arms to clean your dishes. If your dishes are not getting clean, or you hear strange noises during the wash cycle, this pump might be the culprit. Removing it is a bit more involved than the drain pump, but still manageable.

You will need to access the underside of the dishwasher, just as you did for the drain pump. Carefully tilt the appliance onto its back or side. The circulation pump is usually connected directly to the wash tub's sump assembly. It has a larger intake hose from the tub and an outlet that feeds the spray arms. Begin by disconnecting the electrical power harness. Press the tab and pull the connector firmly but gently. Next, disconnect the water hoses. There might be one or more large hoses connected to this pump. Use your pliers or screwdriver to release the clamps and pull the hoses off. Be prepared for more water spillage than with the drain pump, as this pump handles the main wash water.

The circulation pump is often secured with screws or clips. Look closely at how it mounts to the sump or chassis. There may be two to four screws holding it in place. Remove these screws. Sometimes, the pump has rubber mounts that slide into slots. You might need to gently pry it up or wiggle it free once the screws are out. Once all fasteners are removed and hoses/wires are detached, the circulation pump should separate from the dishwasher. Take care not to damage the impeller or any seals during removal. If you are replacing the entire unit, ensure the new pump matches the old one perfectly before reinstalling. This is a common step if you plan to [replace an LG dishwasher pump motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-dishwasher-pump-motor).

### Post-Removal Actions: Inspection, Cleaning, and Reinstallation Tips

After you successfully remove the LG dishwasher pump, what do you do next? The work is not over. This is a great chance to inspect the pump and surrounding areas. You can also clean parts or prepare for a new pump installation. Taking these extra steps helps ensure your repair lasts.

First, thoroughly inspect the removed pump. Look for anything that could cause a blockage. This includes food particles, broken glass, or small objects. Check the impeller for cracks or wear. A damaged impeller cannot move water properly. Also, inspect the motor shaft for excessive play or signs of burning. These indicate a motor failure. If you find a blockage, you might be able to [unblock your LG dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-unblock-lg-dishwasher-pump) effectively. If the pump is just dirty, a good cleaning might be all it needs. You can learn more about how to [clean a dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-pump) to restore its function.

Next, clean the area where the pump was installed. Use a cloth to wipe away any grime or debris from the sump. Check the hoses for clogs or damage. Now is also a good time to inspect the dishwasher's filter assembly again. Make sure it is clean before reinstallation. When you are ready to reinstall a new or repaired pump, simply reverse the removal steps. Connect the hoses securely. Make sure all clamps are tightened. Reattach the electrical connectors firmly. Then, secure the pump with its screws or twist-lock mechanism. Before pushing the dishwasher back into its cabinet, double-check all connections. This prevents leaks.

## FAQ Section

### How do I know if my LG dishwasher pump is bad?

You can suspect a bad LG dishwasher pump if your dishes are not getting clean (circulation pump issue) or if water remains in the tub after a cycle (drain pump issue).

A lack of water pressure during the wash cycle often points to the circulation pump failing.

### Can I remove the LG dishwasher pump without pulling out the entire dishwasher?

For most LG dishwasher models, you must pull the entire dishwasher out from its cabinet to access the pump. The pumps are located underneath the appliance. While some minor components might be accessible from the front, disconnecting the hoses and electrical connections to the pump requires getting to the side or back.

### What's the difference between an LG dishwasher drain pump and a circulation pump?

The LG dishwasher drain pump removes dirty water from the dishwasher tub after a cycle. It is smaller and connects to the drain hose. The circulation pump, which is larger, recirculates wash water through the spray arms during the cleaning cycle. One drains, the other washes.
