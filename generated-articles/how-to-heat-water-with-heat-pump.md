A heat pump heats water by extracting heat from the surrounding air or ground and transferring it into a water tank. This process is highly energy-efficient because it simply moves existing heat rather than generating new heat, using significantly less electricity than conventional electric water heaters.

## The Science Behind Heating Water with a Heat Pump

Understanding how a heat pump works helps us see its efficiency. A heat pump water heater does not generate heat. It moves heat. This is a key difference from electric resistance or gas water heaters. They use a small amount of electricity to do this work.

The process begins with a fan that pulls in air from the room. This air contains heat energy. Even cool air holds some heat. The heat pump then passes this air over an evaporator coil. This coil contains a special refrigerant. The refrigerant absorbs heat from the air. This causes the refrigerant to turn into a warm gas.

Next, the warm gas moves to a compressor. The compressor increases the pressure and temperature of the gas. This makes the gas very hot. This hot, high-pressure gas then goes to a condenser coil. The condenser coil is inside the water tank or transfers heat to the water in the tank. The water absorbs the heat from the hot gas. This makes the water hot for your home. As the gas loses its heat, it cools down and turns back into a liquid. This liquid then returns to the evaporator coil. The cycle repeats, continuously moving heat into your water.

This method uses electricity mainly to power the fan and compressor. It does not use electricity to create heat directly. This makes it much more efficient. For every unit of electricity used, a heat pump can deliver multiple units of heat. This efficiency translates into lower energy bills. It also reduces your carbon footprint. You get hot water using less energy overall.
