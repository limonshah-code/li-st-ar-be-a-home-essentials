## AirPods After Washing Machine: Do They Survive?

We have all had that sinking feeling. You reach into your pocket, and instead of finding your beloved AirPods, you pull them from the bottom of your washing machine. A moment of panic sets in: **Do AirPods work after washing machine** exposure? It is a common problem, and the answer is not always simple.

This article explores what happens when AirPods go for an unexpected spin. We will discuss the chances of survival, immediate steps to take, and how to dry your AirPods correctly. I will share my insights on assessing water damage and preventing future laundry mishaps. Get ready to learn the best way to handle this stressful situation.

### Takeaway

*   Act fast to remove AirPods from the washing machine.
*   Do not try to charge or use them immediately after they get wet.
*   Thoroughly dry AirPods and their case for several days.
*   Success is not guaranteed, but quick action increases the chance of survival.

### Do AirPods work after washing machine exposure?

The short answer is: sometimes, but often not without issues. AirPods are not fully waterproof; they have some water resistance, depending on the model. A full washing machine cycle exposes them to too much water, detergent, and agitation. This greatly increases the risk of permanent internal damage.

### The Immediate Aftermath: What Happens When AirPods Go for a Spin

Finding your AirPods in the washing machine is a shocking experience. You likely feel a rush of disappointment and worry. The first thing you need to understand is the severity of the situation. A washing machine cycle is far more aggressive than a splash of rain.

When your AirPods go through a wash cycle, they face multiple threats. First, there is the water itself. Even water-resistant devices can only handle so much direct exposure. Second, detergent and other cleaning chemicals inside the washing machine introduce corrosive elements. These chemicals can damage electronic components very quickly. Third, the physical agitation and spinning can cause internal parts to shift or break. This combination of water, chemicals, and force creates a very challenging environment for any electronic device.

Your AirPods are delicate pieces of technology. They contain small batteries, circuit boards, and speakers. Water can short-circuit these parts, leading to immediate failure. Detergent residue can leave behind conductive films that cause problems later. If your AirPods went through a complete wash cycle, their chances of coming out unscathed are very low. However, quick action can make a difference. Do not lose all hope yet.

### Understanding AirPods Water Resistance (and its limits)

Many people assume AirPods are waterproof. This is a common misunderstanding. Most AirPods models offer water resistance, but not true waterproofing. There is an important distinction between these terms. Water resistance means a device can withstand minor splashes or sweat. Waterproof means it can be fully submerged without damage.

Current AirPods models like AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation) and AirPods (3rd generation) have an IPX4 water resistance rating. This rating means they resist sweat and water splashes from any direction. It is good for workouts or light rain. It does not mean they can survive immersion in a washing machine. The force of the water jets, combined with detergents, easily bypasses these seals.

Older models, like AirPods (1st and 2nd generation), have no official water resistance rating at all. This means they are even more vulnerable to water damage. The charging case for all AirPods models is not water-resistant or waterproof. If the case went through the wash, it almost certainly has significant damage. Understanding these limits helps set realistic expectations for your wet AirPods.

### First Aid for Wet AirPods: Immediate Steps to Take

Finding your AirPods soaked is stressful, but quick action is vital. Do not panic; follow these steps immediately to improve their chances. The sooner you act, the better the outcome might be for your wet AirPods. I have seen many people make mistakes here.

First, retrieve your AirPods and their charging case from the washing machine. Remove them as soon as you discover them. Do not try to turn them on or connect them to your device. This could cause a short circuit if water is still inside. Powering on a wet device usually makes the damage worse. Avoid shaking the AirPods, as this can spread water further internally.

Next, gently wipe down the outside of both the AirPods and the case with a soft, lint-free cloth. Use a dry cloth to absorb as much surface moisture as possible. Pay attention to the charging ports and speaker grilles. Do not use heat, such as a hairdryer, as extreme heat can damage internal components. Do not try to charge the case or the AirPods. Charging a wet device is a major risk and can cause further, irreversible damage.

Open the charging case lid and keep it open. This allows air to circulate inside. Place the AirPods outside the case for now. The goal is to maximize airflow to all parts. Remember, patience is your biggest ally during this stage.

### The Drying Process: Patience is Key for AirPod Survival

After the immediate wipe-down, the most important step is thorough drying. This process takes time, sometimes several days. You must be patient; rushing can ruin any chance of recovery for your wet AirPods. Do not put them in direct sunlight or use heat sources.

Place your AirPods and their case in a dry, well-ventilated area. A good spot is on a paper towel or a dry cloth on a countertop. Some people use desiccants to absorb moisture. Silica gel packets, often found in new shoe boxes or vitamin bottles, are very effective. Place the AirPods and case in a sealed container or bag with several silica gel packets. Make sure the AirPods are separate from the case. The silica gel works by drawing moisture out of the air and from the devices.

Avoid using raw rice as a drying agent. While popular, rice dust can get into the charging ports and other openings. This can cause more problems down the line. It is not as effective as silica gel either. Leave your AirPods and case to dry for at least 48-72 hours. Longer is often better, especially if they were very wet. Resist the urge to check them or try to turn them on during this time. I know it is hard, but waiting is crucial. Once thoroughly dry, try charging them. Start by charging the case, then place the AirPods inside.

### Assessing the Damage: Signs Your AirPods Are Failing

After the extensive drying period, it is time to check if your AirPods work after washing machine exposure. This moment can be nerve-wracking. Look for clear signs of damage or proper function. Do not expect perfect results.

First, inspect the physical appearance. Look for any visible corrosion in the charging contacts or speaker grilles. You might see green or white residue. This is a clear sign of water damage. If you clean your AirPods often, you know what healthy contacts look like. Sometimes, the internal components might be too damaged to clean effectively. You might want to refer to articles like [how to clean wax out of AirPods](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-wax-out-of-airpods) or [how to clean AirPods case](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-airpods-case) for comparison to a healthy state.

Next, try to charge them. Place the AirPods back into the charging case and connect the case to power. Check the charging indicator light on the case. If it lights up, that is a good sign. If there is no light, the case might be completely damaged. Let them charge for at least an hour. Then, try to pair them with your device. If they pair, try playing audio. Listen for sound quality issues. You might notice distorted sound, low volume, or no sound at all from one or both AirPods. The battery might drain quickly, too. These are all signs of internal water damage. If you encounter strange stains on your case, it could be related to the wash.

### Repair Options and Replacement Costs for Water-Damaged AirPods

If your AirPods do not work after washing machine submersion, you have limited options. Apple's standard warranty does not cover water damage. This means any repair or replacement will come at a cost to you. Apple defines water damage as accidental damage.

You can contact Apple Support or visit an Apple Store. They will assess the damage. Often, they will offer a replacement for a fee. The cost for a single AirPod replacement or case replacement is usually less than buying a brand-new set. However, replacing both AirPods and the case often approaches the cost of new ones. Third-party repair shops might offer some services. Be cautious with these options. AirPods are difficult to repair due to their compact design. Many third-party repairs might not be effective or could void any remaining limited warranty.

Consider the cost versus the benefit. If your AirPods are older, buying a new pair might make more sense. Newer models offer better features and sometimes better water resistance. My advice is to weigh the replacement cost against the price of a new set. Sometimes, an unfortunate accident becomes an opportunity for an upgrade.

### Preventing Future Washing Machine Mishaps with AirPods

The best way to deal with wet AirPods is to prevent the accident in the first place. I have learned this lesson the hard way. Taking simple precautions can save you money and frustration. This is about establishing new habits.

First, always check your pockets before doing laundry. Make this a routine. I always feel my pockets for my phone, wallet, and AirPods before putting clothes in the washing machine. Get into the habit of emptying all pockets before clothes go into the laundry basket. This is the simplest and most effective prevention method. Train yourself to pat down every pocket.

Second, consider using a brightly colored AirPod case. A vibrant case is easier to spot if it falls out of your pocket or bag. This makes it less likely to be overlooked among dirty clothes. You could also attach a lanyard or clip to your AirPod case. Clip it inside your bag or to your belt loop. This keeps them secure and visible.

Third, designate a specific place for your AirPods when not in use. When you get home, put them on a charging stand or a specific tray. Do not leave them loose on tables or near laundry areas. Consistency is key here. If they have a designated home, they are less likely to end up in the wash. These small steps can prevent big problems.

### My Own Experience and Final Thoughts on AirPod Survival

I once had my own heart-stopping moment with AirPods and a washing machine. It was a pair of older AirPods, the first generation, without any water resistance. I had forgotten them in a jeans pocket. After the cycle finished, I heard a clunk inside the machine. My stomach dropped. I knew instantly what it was.

I pulled them out, soaked and sad. I followed the immediate steps: wiped them down, did not try to power them on. I placed them in a container with silica gel packets for three full days. My hopes were not high. When I finally tried to charge them, the case light flickered, then died. One AirPod showed a faint connection, but no sound came out. The other was completely dead. It was a tough lesson learned. My AirPods did not work after washing machine exposure.

This experience taught me the importance of prevention. Now, I always do a pocket check. I also realize that while some lucky people get their AirPods to work again, it is the exception, not the rule. Modern AirPods have better water resistance, but a washing machine is still too much. If you find yourself in this situation, follow the drying steps. Do not expect miracles, but give them a fighting chance. If they survive, consider yourself very lucky. If not, it is an unfortunate but common accident.

### FAQ Section

#### How long should I dry my AirPods after washing machine exposure?
You should dry your AirPods and their charging case for at least 48 to 72 hours. Place them in a dry, well-ventilated area with desiccants like silica gel packets. Resist the urge to turn them on or charge them during this period. Patience is crucial for maximizing their chance of recovery.

#### Can Apple fix water-damaged AirPods?
Apple's standard warranty does not cover water damage because it is considered accidental damage. Apple typically offers out-of-warranty replacements for a fee, rather than repairing water-damaged AirPods. The cost for replacements can be close to buying a new pair, depending on the number of components needed.

#### Is the rice method effective for drying wet AirPods?
The rice method is generally not recommended for drying wet AirPods. While rice can absorb some moisture, fine dust particles from the rice can get into the charging ports and speaker grilles. This can cause further damage or blockages. Silica gel packets are a much safer and more effective alternative.

#### What are the signs of water damage on AirPods?
Signs of water damage include distorted or no audio, rapid battery drain, failure to charge, or inability to pair. Physically, you might see corrosion on the charging contacts (greenish or whitish residue). The case might not light up or respond. Any abnormal function after drying indicates internal damage.

#### How can I prevent AirPods from going into the washing machine?
The best prevention method is to always check your pockets thoroughly before putting clothes into the laundry. Establish a habit of emptying all pockets. You can also use a brightly colored AirPod case for better visibility or attach a lanyard to keep them secure and visible. Designate a specific spot for your AirPods when not in use.

#### Will my AirPods Pro survive a washing machine cycle due to water resistance?
While AirPods Pro have an IPX4 water resistance rating, this protects against sweat and splashes, not full submersion in a washing machine. The intense agitation, heat, and detergents in a wash cycle far exceed their resistance capabilities. Survival is unlikely, and permanent damage is very probable.

### Conclusion

Finding your AirPods after an unexpected washing machine adventure is a moment of dread. While modern AirPods offer some water resistance, a full wash cycle is usually too much for them. The combination of water, detergent, and agitation often leads to irreversible damage. Your AirPods might not work after washing machine exposure, but taking quick, correct action can sometimes make a difference.

Remember to retrieve them immediately, wipe them dry, and let them air out thoroughly with silica gel for several days. Do not try to charge them or turn them on before they are completely dry. If they do not recover, Apple offers replacement options, although at a cost. The best strategy is always prevention: check your pockets. My personal experience reinforces this. Learn from these accidents and implement simple habits to protect your valuable electronics.
