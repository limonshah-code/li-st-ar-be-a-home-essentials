## Troubleshooting Your Craftsman Air Compressor: Why It Won't Turn On

It is frustrating when your trusty Craftsman air compressor refuses to start. You are ready to tackle a project, but your machine stays silent. I understand this common problem can stop your work. Many factors prevent a Craftsman air compressor from turning on. This guide helps you diagnose and fix these issues. We will explore power problems, pressure switch faults, motor issues, and more. Let us get your compressor running again.

#### Takeaway:

*   Always begin troubleshooting by checking the power source and connections.
*   The pressure switch is a frequent culprit; verify its function and reset it if needed.
*   Allow the motor to cool if thermal overload protection activates.
*   Inspect the start capacitor for damage if the motor hums but does not start.
*   Address unloader valve issues to ensure proper startup sequence.

Your Craftsman air compressor might not turn on due to an issue with its power supply, a tripped circuit breaker, a faulty pressure switch, an activated thermal overload, a defective start capacitor, or a stuck unloader valve. Diagnosing the exact problem requires systematic checking of these components.

## Power Supply Issues and Electrical Connections

A Craftsman air compressor that will not turn on often has power problems. This is the first place to check. Ensuring your compressor receives proper electricity is basic troubleshooting. Many simple fixes involve the power source.

### Checking the Power Cord and Outlet

First, look at the power cord. Is it fully plugged into the outlet? Sometimes, a loose connection is the only issue. Check the cord for any visible damage like cuts or fraying. A damaged cord prevents electricity from reaching the compressor.

Next, test the electrical outlet itself. Plug another device, like a lamp, into the same outlet. If the lamp does not turn on, the outlet has no power. This indicates a problem with your home's wiring, not the compressor. Try a different outlet to confirm.

### Circuit Breaker and Fuse Protection

Air compressors draw a lot of power when starting. This can trip a circuit breaker. Go to your home's electrical panel. Look for a tripped breaker, which often sits in the middle position between "on" and "off." Flip it fully "off" and then firmly "on" again. If your compressor uses a fuse, check if it is blown. Replace any blown fuses with a new one of the correct amperage. Repeated tripping suggests a deeper electrical issue or an overloaded motor.

### The Importance of Proper Voltage

Ensure the voltage supplied to the compressor matches its requirements. Most residential Craftsman compressors need 120V. Using an extension cord that is too long or too thin can cause voltage drop. This prevents the compressor from getting enough power to start its motor. Always use a heavy-duty extension cord, if needed, specifically rated for the compressor's amperage and length. This maintains adequate voltage for startup.

## Pressure Switch Problems

The pressure switch is a critical component for your Craftsman air compressor. It controls when the motor starts and stops based on tank pressure. If this switch malfunctions, your compressor will not turn on. A faulty pressure switch is a common reason for startup failures.

### Understanding the Pressure Switch Function

The pressure switch senses the air pressure inside the tank. When the pressure drops below a set minimum, the switch closes. This allows electricity to flow to the motor, starting the compressor. Once the tank reaches its maximum pressure, the switch opens, cutting power to the motor and stopping it. It acts as the brain for the compressor's automatic operation.

### How to Test and Reset the Pressure Switch

To test the pressure switch, first, unplug your compressor for safety. Look for the pressure switch, usually a box mounted on the manifold. Some switches have a small reset button. Try pressing this button to see if it engages. Sometimes, a simple reset is all that is needed. If no button exists, or if resetting does not work, the internal contacts might be stuck. You can gently tap the switch box. This might free a stuck mechanism.

If your Craftsman air compressor is not working at all, including issues that might be related to the pressure switch, you might find more comprehensive troubleshooting steps in this guide: [Why Is My Craftsman Air Compressor Not Working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-craftsman-air-compressor-not-working). This could offer additional context for general malfunctions.

### Diaphragm or Contact Issues

Inside the pressure switch is a diaphragm and electrical contacts. Over time, the diaphragm can stiffen or crack, affecting its ability to sense pressure changes. The electrical contacts can also become corroded or pitted. This prevents them from making proper contact. If the contacts cannot close, the motor will not receive power, and the compressor will not turn on. If you suspect these internal issues, replacing the entire pressure switch is often the most practical solution. Attempting to repair internal components without expertise is not recommended.

## Motor Overload and Thermal Protection

Air compressors, especially during startup, draw significant electrical current. This can cause the motor to overheat. Craftsman air compressors include safety features to prevent damage from overheating. Understanding these features helps in troubleshooting.

### Recognizing Overload Symptoms

If your compressor tries to start but quickly clicks off, or simply makes no sound after a previous long run, it might be overheated. The motor might feel warm to the touch. This indicates the thermal overload protector has activated. This safety device senses excessive heat in the motor windings. It cuts power to prevent damage from overheating. This is a common safety mechanism.

### Allowing for Cool-Down Time

When the thermal overload protector trips, the solution is usually simple. You need to let the motor cool down. Unplug the compressor and wait. Depending on how hot the motor got, this could take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. Some compressors have a manual reset button for the thermal overload, usually a small red button located near the motor or power cord entry. Press this button after the unit has cooled down. If there is no button, the protector resets automatically once cool.

### Compressor Ventilation

Proper ventilation is crucial for preventing motor overheating. Ensure your Craftsman air compressor has enough space around it. Do not operate it in a confined area where heat cannot escape. Keep the motor vents clear of dust and debris. A build-up of dirt insulates the motor, trapping heat. Regularly cleaning the compressor's exterior and ensuring clear airflow pathways helps prevent thermal overload trips. Proper ventilation ensures the motor operates within safe temperature limits.

## Start Capacitor and Motor Issues

If your Craftsman air compressor hums but does not spin up, a failing start capacitor is a likely culprit. This component provides the initial burst of energy needed to get the motor going. Without it, the motor struggles to start or does not start at all.

### Role of the Start Capacitor

The start capacitor provides a momentary surge of electrical current to the motor's start winding. This surge creates a rotating magnetic field. This field helps the motor overcome inertia and begin rotating. Once the motor reaches a certain speed, a centrifugal switch or relay disconnects the start capacitor. It is only active for a fraction of a second during startup.

### Signs of a Failing Capacitor

A common sign of a bad start capacitor is the motor humming loudly but not turning. You might also hear a click, but no motor movement. Sometimes, the capacitor itself can appear visibly damaged. Look for bulging on the capacitor's casing. You might see leaks or even burn marks. If you smell a burning odor, this also indicates a failed capacitor. Testing a capacitor requires a multimeter with a capacitance setting. If you do not have the right tools or experience, it is best to have a professional test it or simply replace it. Always discharge a capacitor before handling it, as it can store a powerful electrical charge.

### Motor Windings and Bearings

Beyond the capacitor, issues with the motor itself can prevent startup. Worn motor bearings can cause excessive friction. This prevents the motor from spinning freely. A motor might hum weakly or seize completely. Another, more severe problem is damaged motor windings. If the windings are shorted or open, the motor will not function. You might smell burning if windings are bad. Replacing bearings can be a complex job. Repairing motor windings usually requires a professional motor shop. Often, a complete motor replacement is necessary if internal motor damage is extensive.

## Unloader Valve Malfunctions

The unloader valve is a small but vital component in an air compressor's starting sequence. It is designed to release residual air pressure from the pump head. This makes it easier for the motor to start against zero pressure. If the unloader valve sticks open or closed, it can prevent your Craftsman air compressor from turning on.

### What an Unloader Valve Does

When an air compressor shuts off, there is still pressurized air trapped in the line between the pump and the check valve. This pressure can make it very difficult for the motor to restart. The unloader valve, which is part of the pressure switch or connected near it, opens briefly when the compressor stops. It vents this trapped air. This ensures the pump is not fighting against high pressure when the motor tries to kick on again.

### Common Unloader Valve Problems

A common problem is the unloader valve sticking in the closed position. If it stays closed, the pump tries to start under full pressure. The motor cannot overcome this resistance and will either hum and trip the breaker or fail to turn on at all. You might hear a hiss of air for a second or two when the compressor shuts off. If you do not hear this hiss, the unloader valve might be stuck closed. Conversely, if the unloader valve sticks open, the compressor will run constantly. It will also struggle to build pressure.

### Checking for Air Leaks

While not directly an unloader valve issue, air leaks in the system can also affect compressor startup. Leaks can cause the compressor to cycle on more frequently. This puts more stress on the unloader valve and motor. Check all fittings and hoses for leaks. You can spray soapy water on connections. Bubbles indicate a leak. A significant leak can cause the pressure switch to constantly try to start the motor, leading to overload. Ensure the check valve, which prevents tank air from flowing back to the pump, is also functioning correctly. A faulty check valve can also lead to the pump trying to start against tank pressure.

## Low Oil or Incorrect Oil Type (For Oil-Lubricated Models)

For oil-lubricated Craftsman air compressors, proper lubrication is essential. The right type and amount of oil keep the internal components moving smoothly. Insufficient oil or using the wrong oil can cause severe friction. This increased resistance makes it difficult for the motor to start.

### Oil Level Check

Always check your compressor's oil level before use. Most oil-lubricated models have a dipstick or a sight glass. The oil level should be within the specified range. Operating with low oil can cause components to seize. This puts a huge strain on the motor. If the motor cannot overcome the friction, it will not turn on. Top off the oil if it is low. Ensure the compressor is level when checking the oil.

### Using the Right Compressor Oil

Air compressors require specific types of oil. Do not use automotive engine oil. Compressor oil is designed to withstand high temperatures and pressures. Using the wrong oil can lead to excessive foaming, carbon buildup, and reduced lubrication. This increases friction within the pump. This added resistance can prevent the motor from starting properly. Refer to your Craftsman owner's manual for the exact oil specification. For more detailed information on compressor oil, you can read [What Kind of Oil Does My Craftsman Air Compressor Use](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-kind-of-oil-does-my-craftsman-air-compressor-use). Using the correct oil prolongs the life of your compressor.

### Impact on Motor Operation

When internal pump components lack proper lubrication, they create significant drag. The motor requires more power to turn the pump. If the resistance is too high, the motor might hum and trip its thermal overload. It may even seize completely. Regular oil changes are also important. Old, dirty oil loses its lubricating properties. It can also contain contaminants that damage pump parts. A well-lubricated pump ensures the motor can start easily and run efficiently.

## Clogged Air Filters and Inlet Valves

An air compressor needs to breathe. The air filter and inlet valves ensure clean air enters the pump. If these components are clogged or obstructed, it affects the compressor's ability to operate. A restricted intake can place undue strain on the motor, preventing it from starting.

### Air Filter Inspection and Cleaning

The air filter prevents dust and debris from entering the compressor pump. Over time, this filter can become dirty and clogged. A clogged filter restricts airflow into the pump. This makes it harder for the compressor to draw in air. The motor works harder, leading to potential overheating or an inability to start.

To check the air filter, locate its housing, usually near the pump. Remove the filter element. Inspect it for excessive dirt or damage. Many filters can be cleaned with compressed air or by washing, depending on the type. Replace heavily soiled or damaged filters. A clean filter ensures optimal airflow.

### Inlet Valve Obstructions

The inlet valves, also known as intake valves or reed valves, control the flow of air into the compressor cylinder. If these valves are stuck or obstructed, the compressor pump cannot effectively draw in air. This creates a vacuum or resistance that the motor struggles against. Debris can sometimes bypass a worn filter and jam an inlet valve.

To check inlet valves, you might need to partially disassemble the pump head. This is a more advanced task. Look for any foreign objects or signs of wear on the valves. If a valve is not seating properly, it can cause problems. A compressor struggling to draw air due to valve issues will often fail to start.

### Importance of Airflow

Proper airflow is vital for an air compressor's health. The motor needs to move air freely without excessive resistance. Restricted airflow from clogged filters or stuck inlet valves forces the motor to exert more effort. This extra effort can cause the motor to trip its thermal overload or simply fail to turn on. Regular maintenance, including filter checks, keeps the air intake path clear. This helps your Craftsman air compressor start reliably. While this article focuses on starting, general cleaning practices, such as those described for maintaining your tank, contribute to overall health.
