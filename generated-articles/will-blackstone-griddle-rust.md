## Does Your Blackstone Griddle Rust? A Guide to Prevention

You just bought a new Blackstone griddle. You love the idea of cooking outdoors. Many people ask a key question about these popular cooking tools. They wonder, "Will Blackstone griddle rust?" It is a common worry for griddle owners. Rust can appear on any steel surface. Knowing about rust helps you protect your investment. This article explores why rust forms and how to stop it. We also cover how to fix rust if it appears. You will learn simple steps to keep your griddle in top shape for years.

### Takeaway

*   **Blackstone griddles can rust.** They are made of steel, which rusts when exposed to moisture and air.
*   **Seasoning prevents rust.** A good layer of seasoning creates a protective barrier.
*   **Clean and dry your griddle after each use.** Moisture is the main cause of rust.
*   **Store your griddle properly.** Use a cover and keep it in a dry place.
*   **Remove rust quickly.** Address any rust spots as soon as you see them. This stops further damage.

A Blackstone griddle can rust. Its cooking surface is carbon steel. Steel rusts when it meets oxygen and water. This process is called oxidation. Proper care, especially seasoning and diligent drying, prevents rust. If rust appears, you can remove it.

## Understanding Blackstone Griddle Rust: The Basics

Blackstone griddles provide great outdoor cooking. Their large steel cooktops are perfect for many meals. However, steel is prone to rust. Rust is a natural process. It happens when iron in the steel reacts with oxygen and water. This forms iron oxides, which we call rust.

Your griddle can rust for several reasons. Leaving it wet is a big one. Rain, dew, or even high humidity causes problems. Food residue left on the surface can also hold moisture. This creates spots where rust can start. A lack of proper seasoning makes your griddle vulnerable. Seasoning acts as a shield against rust. Understanding these basics helps you protect your griddle.

### The Nature of Steel and Oxidation

Blackstone griddles use a rolled steel cooking surface. This material is strong and holds heat well. It is also an iron alloy. Iron naturally reacts with oxygen and water. This reaction creates ferric oxide, which is red-brown rust. Rust forms on the surface of the steel. It can spread quickly if left untreated.

Rust weakens the steel over time. It makes the surface rough. This rough surface can cause food to stick. It also makes cleaning harder. My own griddle started to show small rust spots after a rainy week. I had not covered it well enough. I learned that day how fast rust can develop. Protecting your griddle from this process is important for its life and performance.

### Factors Contributing to Rust

Several factors speed up the rusting process. Moisture is the biggest enemy. Rain, morning dew, or even high humidity contribute. Leaving water on the griddle surface lets rust form. A second factor is improper cleaning. Food bits left behind can hold moisture. This creates damp spots where rust starts.

Lack of seasoning is another major cause. Seasoning is a layer of polymerized oil. It creates a barrier between the steel and the elements. Without this barrier, the raw steel is exposed. Salt and acidic foods also promote rust. They can break down the seasoning layer. Always clean your griddle well after cooking these items. Proper care prevents these issues.

## The Importance of Seasoning: Your Griddle's First Defense

Seasoning is the most important step for rust prevention. It creates a protective layer. This layer covers the bare steel. It stops oxygen and moisture from reaching the metal. Think of it as a natural, non-stick coating that also protects. A well-seasoned griddle resists rust much better.

Seasoning involves applying thin layers of oil. You then heat the griddle to a high temperature. The oil bakes onto the surface. This process turns the oil into a hard, dark film. This film is what protects your griddle. It also makes your griddle non-stick. Each time you cook with oil, you add to this protective layer. This makes your griddle stronger against rust over time.

### How Seasoning Works

Seasoning transforms cooking oil into a hard, plastic-like coating. When you heat oil to its smoke point, it breaks down. It then polymerizes. This means it forms long chains of molecules. These chains bond to the steel surface. They fill microscopic pores in the metal. The result is a smooth, slick, non-stick layer.

This layer serves two key purposes. First, it creates a barrier. This barrier stops oxygen and water from touching the steel. This prevents rust. Second, it makes cooking easier. Food slides around without sticking. A good seasoning layer also gives your griddle a deep, dark color. This color shows that your griddle is well-protected.

### Initial Seasoning Steps

When you get a new Blackstone griddle, initial seasoning is critical. This first process lays the foundation. It protects your griddle from rust right away. It also prepares it for cooking. Skip this step, and your griddle will rust quickly.

Follow these steps for initial seasoning:

*   **Clean the Griddle:** Wash the new griddle top with hot, soapy water. Use a soft cloth. Rinse it completely. Dry it thoroughly immediately. You must remove all factory residues.
*   **Apply a Thin Layer of Oil:** Use a high-smoke point oil. Vegetable oil, flaxseed oil, or Blackstone seasoning oil works well. Apply a very thin, even layer over the entire cooking surface. Wipe off any excess. The griddle should look dry, not greasy.
*   **Heat the Griddle:** Turn on your griddle burners to high heat. The oil will smoke. Let it smoke until it stops. This usually takes 15-20 minutes. The surface will turn dark brown or black.
*   **Repeat:** Let the griddle cool slightly. Apply another thin layer of oil. Repeat the heating process. Do this 3-4 times for a strong initial seasoning. Some people do 5 or 6 layers. This first seasoning is very important for rust prevention and a non-stick surface.

## Routine Cleaning for Rust Prevention

Regular cleaning is just as important as seasoning for rust prevention. After every cook, you must clean your griddle. This removes food bits and grease. These residues can hold moisture. They can also break down your seasoning layer. A clean griddle is a happy griddle.

Cleaning does not have to be hard. It becomes a quick habit after a few uses. The goal is to remove all food debris. Then you need to dry the surface completely. Finally, you apply a very thin layer of oil. This routine keeps your seasoning strong. It also keeps rust away.

### Immediate Post-Cook Cleaning

The best time to clean your griddle is right after you finish cooking. The griddle surface is still warm. This heat helps to loosen cooked-on food. It also helps oil penetrate the seasoning. Do not let food cool and stick.

Here is how to do it:

*   **Scrape Off Debris:** Use a griddle scraper to push food bits into the grease trap. Scrape while the griddle is still hot. This makes it much easier.
*   **Wipe Down:** Use paper towels or a griddle cloth to wipe away grease and small bits. For stubborn spots, pour a little water on the hot griddle. The water will steam and loosen residue. Scrape again.
*   **Dry Completely:** Turn off the burners. Let the griddle cool enough to touch. Use paper towels to dry the surface fully. No moisture should remain.
*   **Apply Oil:** Put a very thin layer of cooking oil on the griddle surface. Wipe it around with a paper towel. This replenishes your seasoning. This final step is crucial for rust prevention. It seals the surface until your next cook.

### Tools and Techniques

Having the right tools makes griddle cleaning easy. A good griddle scraper is essential. It helps you remove food quickly. Metal scrapers are best for tough residue. A griddle brick or pumice stone can help with really stubborn spots. These tools gently abrade the surface. They do not damage the seasoning if used correctly. Sometimes, my griddle gets a really stuck-on mess. Using a griddle brick helps clean it without starting over. You can find out more about this process in our article on [how to clean Blackstone griddle with pumice stone](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-blackstone-griddle-with-pumice-stone).

Use paper towels for wiping. They absorb grease well and are disposable. A griddle cleaning kit often includes a scraper, a handle, and pads. These kits are very helpful. Avoid harsh soaps or steel wool for routine cleaning. They can strip your seasoning. For most cleans, heat, scraping, and wiping are all you need.

## Proper Storage and Protection from Elements

Proper storage is vital for preventing rust. Even a perfectly seasoned griddle can rust if stored incorrectly. Your griddle is often outside. This means it is exposed to weather. Rain, dew, and humidity are constant threats. Protecting it from these elements is key.

Storage means more than just throwing a cover over it. You need to consider where you put your griddle. Think about the type of cover you use. Also consider long-term storage during off-seasons. A little effort in storage saves you big problems later. This step ensures your griddle lasts for many years.

### Choosing the Right Griddle Cover

A good griddle cover is your first line of defense against the elements. It protects the cooking surface from rain and dust. A cover also keeps out insects and debris. Look for a cover made from durable, waterproof material. Many griddle brands offer custom-fit covers. These fit snugly.

Ensure the cover reaches below the griddle top. This protects the sides as well. Some covers have vents. Vents help prevent moisture buildup inside. Trapped moisture under a cover can actually cause rust. After a rain, remove the cover for a short time. Let any condensation evaporate. This simple step helps keep your griddle dry.

### Storing During Off-Season

When you will not use your griddle for a long time, prepare it for storage. This is especially true for winter months. First, clean the griddle thoroughly. Make sure it is completely dry. Then, apply a generous layer of cooking oil. This thick layer adds extra rust protection. You can even use a thin layer of wax if you prefer.

Store your griddle in a dry place. A garage or shed is ideal. Avoid damp basements or uncovered outdoor areas. If you must store it outside, ensure the cover is high quality. Elevate the griddle slightly off the ground. This stops moisture from wicking up from the concrete. Taking these steps prevents rust during long periods of non-use.

## Dealing with Rust: When It Happens

Even with the best care, rust can sometimes appear. Do not panic if you see a rust spot. Small rust spots are common. You can fix them easily. The key is to address rust quickly. Ignoring rust allows it to spread. This can cause more damage.

Rust removal is not difficult. It requires a bit of effort and the right tools. After removing rust, you must re-season the affected area. This puts the protective layer back. Being prepared to deal with rust ensures your griddle stays in great condition. I have had to remove rust from my griddle a few times. Each time, it came off easily because I caught it early.

### Early Stage Rust Removal

For small, light rust spots, you can often remove them with simple methods. First, make sure the griddle is cool. Next, apply a small amount of cooking oil to the rusted area. Use a paper towel or soft cloth to rub the oil on the rust. Then, gently scrub the rust spot. You can use a wadded-up paper towel, a nylon scrubbing pad, or even a potato cut in half with salt on it. The potato and salt act as a mild abrasive.

The goal is to gently remove the rust without damaging surrounding seasoning. After scrubbing, wipe away the rust and oil. The surface should be clean and smooth. Then, apply a thin layer of fresh oil and heat the area. This re-seasons the spot. Early detection and quick action prevent minor rust from becoming a big problem.

### Deep Rust Solutions

If rust has spread or is very stubborn, you might need stronger methods. This is when you might need to strip and re-season the griddle. For heavier rust, you can use a flat metal scraper. Apply some cooking oil to the rust. Then, carefully scrape the affected areas. Be firm, but avoid digging into the steel. You can also use a grill brick or coarse sandpaper (100-150 grit) for more aggressive rust. Work in small circles. Always apply a little oil as you scrub. This helps lift the rust.

After removing all rust, clean the griddle well. Wipe away all rust particles. Then, you must completely re-season the griddle. This is important. If you need a more thorough guide on removing rust, check out our article on [how to clean rust off of Blackstone](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-rust-off-of-blackstone). If the rust is severe, you might need to completely strip the old seasoning and rust. We have a detailed guide on [how to strip Blackstone griddle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-strip-blackstone-griddle).

## Re-seasoning After Rust Removal

Removing rust leaves the steel bare and exposed. This means the area is now very vulnerable to rust again. Re-seasoning after rust removal is not optional; it is essential. This step rebuilds the protective barrier. It also restores the non-stick surface. Do not skip this process.

The re-seasoning process is similar to the initial seasoning. It ensures that your griddle surface is fully protected. It helps your griddle perform its best. A well-re-seasoned griddle will look dark and shiny. It will be ready for many more cooks.

### Preparing for Re-seasoning

Before re-seasoning, ensure the griddle surface is clean. All rust particles must be gone. Wipe down the entire griddle top. Use paper towels to remove any loose debris or oil residue. The surface should feel smooth. If you used a lot of water to clean, make sure the griddle is completely dry. You can heat it briefly on low to evaporate any moisture. A dry surface allows the oil to bond properly.

Having the right oil ready is also important. Use a high-smoke point oil like flaxseed oil, vegetable oil, or a specific griddle seasoning blend. Make sure you have plenty of paper towels or a lint-free cloth. Preparation makes the re-seasoning process smooth and effective.

### The Re-seasoning Process

Re-seasoning follows the same principles as the initial seasoning.

*   **Apply Thin Oil Layer:** Put a very thin layer of high-smoke point oil on the cleaned, rust-free surface. Spread it evenly with a paper towel. Wipe off all excess. The surface should look almost dry, not wet or greasy. Too much oil will create a sticky mess.
*   **Heat the Griddle:** Turn all burners to high heat. Let the griddle heat up until the oil starts to smoke. Let it smoke vigorously. This usually takes 15-20 minutes per layer. The griddle surface will darken.
*   **Cool and Repeat:** Turn off the burners. Let the griddle cool enough to touch safely. It should be warm, not cold. Repeat the oil application and heating process. Do this at least 3-4 times. Each layer builds on the last. It creates a stronger, more protective seasoning.
