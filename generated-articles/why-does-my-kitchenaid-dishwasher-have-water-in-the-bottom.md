## Solving Standing Water in Your KitchenAid Dishwasher

Discovering a pool of water at the bottom of your KitchenAid dishwasher after a cycle finishes can be incredibly frustrating. This standing water often signals a drainage problem. You expect clean dishes, not a mini-pond inside your appliance. Addressing this issue quickly prevents unpleasant odors and potential damage.

I know how annoying it is when your dishwasher does not work right. Fixing these problems often involves simple checks. This guide explains common reasons for water in the bottom of your KitchenAid dishwasher. We will cover how to identify the cause. We also provide clear steps to resolve the issue. By the end, you will understand how to get your KitchenAid dishwasher draining properly again.

### Takeaway

If your KitchenAid dishwasher has water in the bottom, here are the key steps to take:

*   **Clean Filters and Sump:** Remove debris from the filter screens and sump area.
*   **Check Drain Hose:** Look for kinks, clogs, or blockages in the drain hose.
*   **Inspect Air Gap/Garbage Disposal:** Ensure proper function and clear any clogs.
*   **Test Drain Pump:** Listen for the pump and check for power.
*   **Examine Check Valve:** Verify it opens and closes correctly to prevent backflow.

A KitchenAid dishwasher typically has water in the bottom due to a drainage obstruction or component malfunction. Common causes include clogged filters, a kinked or blocked drain hose, issues with the garbage disposal connection or air gap, a faulty drain pump, or a malfunctioning check valve. Clearing blockages and checking components usually resolves the problem.

## Understanding KitchenAid Dishwasher Drainage

Before we dive into troubleshooting, let's understand how a KitchenAid dishwasher normally drains. Knowing the correct process helps diagnose issues. Water should completely leave the tub after each wash and rinse cycle. This prevents dirty water from sitting and causing odors or damage.

When the drain cycle begins, the drain pump activates. It pushes water out of the dishwasher tub. The water travels through the drain hose. This hose connects to either your kitchen sink's drain or a garbage disposal. Finally, the water enters your home's drainage system.

If any part of this system fails, water remains in the tub. A well-functioning drain system is crucial. It ensures hygienic cleaning and prevents standing water. My own experience taught me the importance of a clear drainage path.

## Common Culprits: Clogged Filters and Sump Area

One of the most frequent reasons for standing water in your KitchenAid dishwasher is a clogged filter or sump area. Over time, food particles, grease, and debris accumulate here. This blockage prevents water from draining properly. It is a simple issue to fix.

KitchenAid dishwashers usually have a filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. This filter traps large food particles. If the filter becomes completely caked with grime, water cannot pass through it effectively. This causes water to pool inside the dishwasher. You can often see the accumulated gunk on the filter.

To fix this, you need to clean the filter and sump. First, remove the bottom dish rack. Locate the filter assembly. Most KitchenAid models have a cylindrical filter that twists out. You might also find a flat filter underneath. Remove both parts carefully.

Rinse the filter components under running water. Use a brush to scrub away any stuck-on food or grease. Clean the sump area at the bottom of the dishwasher as well. This area is directly under the filter. Remove any visible debris from here. Once clean, reassemble the filters correctly. This step often solves the problem immediately.

## Drain Hose Obstructions and Kinks

The drain hose is another common point of failure when your KitchenAid dishwasher has water in the bottom. This hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. It can easily become blocked or kinked. A simple inspection can reveal the issue.

First, locate the drain hose. It typically connects to the back of the dishwasher. Then it runs to the plumbing under your sink. Look for any visible kinks or sharp bends in the hose. These kinks restrict water flow. Straighten any bends you find. If the hose runs behind cabinets, gently pull the dishwasher out to check the entire length.

Sometimes, blockages occur inside the hose. Food particles or grease can build up over time. Disconnect the drain hose from both ends. Have a bucket ready to catch any water. Then, visually inspect the hose. You can also try to push a long brush or snake through it. This helps clear any internal clogs.

Also, check the connection point at your sink or garbage disposal. Ensure the hose is securely attached. Make sure no clamps are too tight, which could restrict flow. A clogged drain hose is a common cause of standing water, similar to issues seen in other brands like when a [Whirlpool dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom).

## Garbage Disposal Connection and Air Gap Issues

If your KitchenAid dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal unit, problems with the disposal can prevent proper drainage. The dishwasher drain hose connects to a specific port on the disposal. This port can become clogged. If you just installed a new garbage disposal, you might have missed a crucial step.

When connecting a dishwasher to a new garbage disposal, a knockout plug inside the disposal's drain port must be removed. Many people forget this step. The plug prevents water from entering the disposal from the dishwasher. This causes immediate standing water issues. Use a screwdriver and hammer to punch out this plug from inside the disposal's inlet.

Even if the plug is removed, food waste inside the disposal can cause clogs. Run your garbage disposal regularly, especially before starting the dishwasher. This clears any food debris that might block the drain line. Ensure the disposal is completely clear.

Some KitchenAid dishwasher installations include an air gap. An air gap is a small cylindrical device typically mounted on the countertop near the faucet. Its purpose is to prevent contaminated sink water from siphoning back into the dishwasher. If the air gap becomes clogged, water cannot drain properly. Disassemble the air gap and clean any debris you find inside. A clogged air gap or disposal connection often explains why your KitchenAid dishwasher has water in the bottom.

## Malfunctioning Drain Pump

When simple clogs are not the issue, a malfunctioning drain pump is a more serious possibility. The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the dishwasher. If it fails, water will simply sit in the bottom of the tub. Identifying a faulty pump requires a bit more investigation.

Listen carefully during the drain cycle. You should hear a distinct humming or whirring sound as the pump operates. If you hear nothing, or only a faint buzz, the pump might not be getting power or could be seized. A broken pump motor is a common mechanical failure. This prevents water from leaving the tub.

Before assuming the pump is bad, check its power supply. Sometimes, the issue is electrical, not mechanical. Ensure no loose wires are connected to the pump. Also, examine the pump for physical damage. Small objects like broken glass or cherry pits can get past the filter and jam the pump impeller. This prevents it from spinning freely.

Replacing a drain pump can be a complex task. It often involves tipping the dishwasher or pulling it out from under the counter. You will need to access the pump from the bottom or front of the unit. If you are uncomfortable with electrical work or appliance disassembly, consider contacting a professional. A faulty drain pump is a significant reason your KitchenAid dishwasher has water in the bottom.

## Faulty Check Valve

Another critical component in your KitchenAid dishwasher's drainage system is the check valve. This small, one-way valve prevents dirty water that has already drained from flowing back into the dishwasher tub. If the check valve malfunctions, water can easily re-enter the tub, leading to standing water at the bottom. This is different from the dishwasher not drying correctly, which is a separate issue like [why is my KitchenAid dishwasher not drying](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-not-drying).

The check valve is typically located near the drain pump or at the end of the drain hose connection within the sump area. It usually consists of a small flap or ball. This flap allows water to flow out but snaps shut to block any backflow. Over time, the valve can become stuck open due to debris. It might also become worn or broken.

To inspect the check valve, you will need to access the sump area of your KitchenAid dishwasher. This often requires removing the lower spray arm and filter assembly. Once the sump is clear, locate the check valve. Carefully examine it for any trapped food particles or signs of damage. Make sure the flap moves freely.

If the valve is stuck open or damaged, it will allow water back in. You can try to clear any debris that is preventing it from closing. If the valve itself is broken, it will need replacement. This part is usually inexpensive. However, accessing and replacing it might be challenging for some. A faulty check valve is a sneaky culprit causing standing water in your KitchenAid dishwasher.

## High Drain Loop and Other Considerations

Beyond the common issues, a few other factors can contribute to your KitchenAid dishwasher having water in the bottom. One overlooked installation detail is the drain hose's "high loop." This small curve in the drain hose is essential. It prevents water from siphoning back into the dishwasher.

A high drain loop means the drain hose rises above the dishwasher's drain connection point before descending to the disposal or sink drain. This creates an air break. It stops dirty sink water from flowing back into the clean dishwasher tub. If your drain hose sags or lacks this loop, siphoning can occur. This will leave standing water. Ensure the hose is properly secured with a clamp to maintain the high loop.

Less common, but possible, issues include a faulty water inlet valve or control board. If the water inlet valve leaks, it can allow a small amount of water to trickle into the tub even when the dishwasher is off. This slowly fills the bottom. A control board malfunction might improperly signal the drain pump. It might also fail to initiate the drain cycle entirely. These are rarer and usually require professional diagnosis.

Before calling a repair technician, especially if your [KitchenAid dishwasher is beeping and the clean light is flashing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-beeping-and-clean-light-flashing), check your appliance's error codes. Your user manual can interpret these. They might point directly to a drainage issue. If the issue persists after troubleshooting these common points, professional help might be needed. Also, remember to consider the [warranty on a KitchenAid dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-is-the-warranty-on-a-kitchenaid-dishwasher) before initiating expensive repairs.

## Maintenance Tips to Prevent Standing Water

Preventing standing water in your KitchenAid dishwasher is often easier than fixing it. Regular maintenance plays a huge role. By following a few simple steps, you can extend your dishwasher's lifespan. You will also avoid frustrating drainage issues. These tips help keep your appliance running smoothly.

First, always scrape large food particles off dishes before loading them. This significantly reduces the amount of debris entering the dishwasher's filter. Even small scraps can build up over time. Using a pre-rinse function is not always necessary for modern dishwashers, but removing solids is important. This simple habit protects your filters and pump.

Regularly clean your dishwasher's filter assembly. KitchenAid recommends cleaning the filter at least once a month. Some people do it more often, depending on usage. Make it a routine. A clean filter ensures proper water flow and prevents clogs. This is the single most effective preventive measure.

Periodically run a dishwasher cleaning cycle with a specialized cleaner or vinegar. This helps remove grease buildup and mineral deposits from internal components. These deposits can restrict water flow in hoses and pipes. It also helps with general cleanliness. Finally, ensure your drain hose maintains its high loop. Check it occasionally for kinks. Proper maintenance keeps your KitchenAid dishwasher draining correctly. Similar preventative measures are useful for other brands too, for example when your [GE dishwasher has standing water after the cycle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-dishwasher-have-standing-water-after-the-cycle).

## When to Call a Professional for KitchenAid Dishwasher Repair

You have tried all the troubleshooting steps. You cleaned the filters, checked the hose, and inspected the air gap and check valve. Yet, your KitchenAid dishwasher still has water in the bottom. At this point, it is wise to consider calling a professional appliance technician. Some issues are simply too complex or dangerous for DIY repair.

A professional technician has the tools and expertise to diagnose hidden problems. They can accurately test components like the drain pump motor. They also identify electrical issues or control board malfunctions. These parts are often difficult to access or replace without specialized knowledge. Attempting complex repairs without experience can lead to further damage. It can also void your warranty.

Before making the call, check your KitchenAid dishwasher's warranty status. If the appliance is still under warranty, repairs might be covered. Many manufacturers require service by authorized technicians to maintain warranty validity. Be sure to explain all the troubleshooting steps you have already taken. This helps the technician narrow down the problem quickly.

Calling a professional saves you time and prevents frustration. It ensures your KitchenAid dishwasher gets fixed correctly and safely. While I encourage DIY, knowing when to seek expert help is smart. Do not hesitate to contact a qualified repair service if the problem persists.
