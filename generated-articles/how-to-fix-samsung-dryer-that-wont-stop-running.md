## Stop Your Samsung Dryer's Non-Stop Cycle

Imagine your dryer just keeps going, even after the clothes are dry. This is a frustrating problem. A Samsung dryer that won't stop running wastes energy and can damage your clothes. You might wonder what causes this issue. You also need to know how to fix it quickly.

This guide helps you understand why your Samsung dryer runs continuously. We will explore common parts that cause this problem. These parts include the door switch, the main control board, and the moisture sensor. I will provide step-by-step instructions. You can use these steps to diagnose and repair your dryer. We aim to get your dryer working correctly again. This saves you money and brings peace to your laundry routine.

### Takeaway: Restore Your Samsung Dryer's Proper Function

*   **Check the Door Switch:** A common reason your Samsung dryer won't stop running is a faulty door switch. This switch tells the dryer when the door is closed. If it stays stuck "closed," the dryer thinks it needs to keep running.
*   **Inspect the Main Control Board:** The control board acts like the dryer's brain. It sends signals to all parts. A bad control board can send incorrect signals, causing continuous operation.
*   **Examine the Moisture Sensor:** Many Samsung dryers use moisture sensors to detect when clothes are dry. Dirty or faulty sensors can trick the dryer into thinking clothes are still wet, making it run longer.
*   **Look at the Start Button/Panel:** Sometimes, a stuck button on the control panel can mimic a continuous run command. Inspect buttons for physical sticking.
*   **Consider the Motor Relay:** This part controls power to the dryer motor. If it gets stuck in the "on" position, the motor will keep running.

### How to Fix a Samsung Dryer That Won't Stop Running

To fix a Samsung dryer that won't stop running, identify the faulty component. This usually involves checking the door switch, the main control board, or the moisture sensor. Diagnosing the problem often requires disconnecting power and testing parts with a multimeter. Replacing the defective part will stop the continuous operation.

### Understanding Why Your Samsung Dryer Runs Non-Stop

A Samsung dryer that won't stop running is a clear sign something is wrong. Normally, your dryer completes a cycle and then turns off. When it keeps going, it means a signal is not reaching the right component. This signal tells the dryer to stop. Several parts work together to control the drying cycle. If one of these parts malfunctions, your dryer can run endlessly. This is more than an annoyance. It leads to higher energy bills. It also puts wear and tear on your appliance.

Troubleshooting this issue starts with basic observations. Is the dryer producing heat? Does it stop if you open the door? Do any error codes appear on the display? These initial checks help narrow down the possible causes. Sometimes, the dryer does not truly "run non-stop" but takes an extremely long time to dry clothes. This can indicate issues with ventilation or moisture sensing. In such cases, the dryer might keep extending the cycle. We will focus on issues where the dryer simply refuses to turn off, regardless of the clothes' dryness. Remember that sometimes a dryer takes longer than usual to dry, which is a different problem. You can learn more about this by checking out [why does my Samsung dryer take so long to dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-samsung-dryer-take-so-long-to-dry).

Always start by unplugging your dryer. Safety is very important when working with appliances. Electricity can cause serious injury. Never attempt repairs while the dryer is plugged in. Before touching any internal components, wait a few minutes for any stored electricity to dissipate. This simple safety step protects you. It also prevents further damage to your appliance.

#### Basic Checks Before Deeper Dives

Before disassembling your Samsung dryer, perform a few simple checks. These steps can sometimes resolve the issue quickly. They also help confirm the problem is not a simple user error.

*   **Check the Power Cycle:** Unplug the dryer from the wall outlet. Wait about five minutes. Then plug it back in. This simple power cycle can sometimes reset the control board. It might clear a temporary glitch causing the continuous running.
*   **Inspect the Door:** Make sure the dryer door closes completely. Even a slight gap can prevent the dryer from stopping. The door switch requires a full closure to function properly. Sometimes lint or a small item can get stuck. This prevents the door from latching correctly.
*   **Review Cycle Selection:** Double-check the selected drying cycle. Some cycles, like "Wrinkle Prevent," add extra tumbling after the main drying is complete. Ensure you are not simply in one of these extended modes. Make sure the dryer is not set to a "Damp Dry" or similar setting that anticipates further steps.

If these basic checks do not resolve the problem, the issue is likely with an internal component. The next steps will guide you through diagnosing those specific parts. You will need some basic tools like screwdrivers and a multimeter.

### The Door Switch: A Common Culprit for Continuous Operation

The door switch is a critical safety component in your Samsung dryer. Its main job is to detect if the dryer door is closed. When the door is open, the switch breaks the circuit. This stops the dryer from running. This prevents injury. If this switch malfunctions, it can get stuck in the "closed" position. This tells the dryer that the door is always shut. The dryer then keeps running, even when it should stop. This is a very common reason for continuous operation. The door switch is usually located inside the dryer door frame. It is activated by a small tab on the door itself.

Testing the door switch is a simple process. You will need a multimeter. Set the multimeter to the continuity setting. First, unplug the dryer for safety. Locate the door switch. You may need to remove the top panel or front panel to access it. Disconnect the wires from the switch. Place the multimeter probes on the switch terminals. With the door open, the multimeter should show no continuity (open circuit). When you manually press the switch plunger (simulating a closed door), the multimeter should show continuity (closed circuit). If the switch shows continuity when the door is open, or no continuity when pressed, it is faulty.

#### Testing and Replacing a Faulty Door Switch

Replacing a faulty door switch is a straightforward repair. Once you have confirmed the switch is bad, you can order a new one. Make sure you get the correct part number for your specific Samsung dryer model. Different models use different switches.

**Steps to Test and Replace the Door Switch:**

1.  **Unplug the Dryer:** Always start by disconnecting the power cord from the wall outlet.
2.  **Access the Switch:**
    *   For most Samsung dryers, you will need to remove the top panel. This usually involves removing two or three screws at the rear of the top panel. Then, slide the panel back and lift it off.
    *   Alternatively, you might need to remove the front panel. This often involves removing screws along the bottom edge of the front panel and then lifting it.
3.  **Locate the Door Switch:** The door switch is typically mounted near the door opening. It has electrical wires connected to it.
4.  **Disconnect Wires:** Carefully pull off the wires connected to the switch terminals. Take a photo before disconnecting to remember how they attach.
5.  **Test for Continuity:** Set your multimeter to the Rx1 setting or continuity mode.
    *   Touch the probes to the two terminals of the door switch.
    *   The meter should read "open" or "infinity" when the door plunger is released (door open).
    *   Press the door plunger. The meter should read "closed" or near zero ohms (door closed).
    *   If the switch fails either of these tests, it is defective.
6.  **Remove the Old Switch:** The switch is usually held in place by one or two screws, or by plastic clips. Remove the fasteners and carefully pull the old switch out.
7.  **Install the New Switch:** Insert the new door switch into its mounting hole. Secure it with the screws or clips you removed earlier.
8.  **Reconnect Wires:** Attach the wires to the new switch terminals. Make sure they are secure.
9.  **Reassemble the Dryer:** Put the dryer's panels back in place. Secure them with their screws.
10. **Test the Dryer:** Plug the dryer back in. Start a cycle to confirm the repair. The dryer should stop when you open the door.

This repair is usually simple enough for a DIY enthusiast. It saves the cost of a service call.

### Addressing a Malfunctioning Control Board or Timer

The main control board, sometimes called the timer board, is the "brain" of your Samsung dryer. It manages all the dryer's functions. This includes starting, stopping, setting cycle times, and controlling heat. If this board develops a fault, it can send incorrect signals. For example, it might fail to send the "stop" signal when a cycle finishes. This leads to the dryer running continuously. Control board issues can be tricky to diagnose. They often manifest as random problems. The dryer might not respond to button presses, or it might behave erratically. A faulty relay on the board that controls the motor could also get stuck in the "on" position. This causes the motor to run non-stop.

Before assuming the control board is bad, rule out simpler issues. Sometimes, a power surge can cause a temporary glitch in the board's programming. A quick reset can often fix this. However, if the board has physical damage or a persistent fault, it needs replacement. Replacement can be costly. It is important to be sure the board is the problem before you buy a new one. This often involves eliminating all other possible causes first.

#### Resetting Your Samsung Dryer's Control Board

A power reset can often clear minor glitches in the control board. This is the first step before considering a replacement.

**How to Reset Your Dryer:**

1.  **Unplug the Dryer:** Pull the dryer's power cord from the wall outlet.
2.  **Wait:** Leave the dryer unplugged for at least 5 to 10 minutes. This allows the control board to fully discharge any residual electricity and reset.
3.  **Plug Back In:** Reconnect the power cord to the outlet.
4.  **Test:** Try running a short cycle. See if the dryer now stops as expected.

If the problem persists after a power reset, the control board might have a more serious internal fault.

#### When to Replace the Main Control Board

If resetting does not work, and you have ruled out other components like the door switch and moisture sensor, the control board is likely the issue. Replacing the main control board is a more advanced repair. It involves accessing the control panel area. The board is usually located behind the display and buttons.

**Steps to Replace the Control Board:**

1.  **Unplug the Dryer:** Disconnect all power to the appliance.
2.  **Access the Control Panel:** You will need to remove screws that secure the top panel. Then, lift the top panel off. This provides access to the control panel assembly.
3.  **Remove the Control Panel Assembly:** There are typically screws that hold the entire control panel assembly in place. Remove these screws. Gently lift or slide the assembly away from the dryer frame.
4.  **Photograph Connections:** Before disconnecting anything, take clear photos of all wire harnesses and connections on the old control board. This is crucial for correct reassembly.
5.  **Disconnect Wires:** Carefully disconnect all wire harnesses from the old control board. Note any specific clips or fasteners.
6.  **Remove the Old Board:** The control board itself is usually secured by plastic tabs or small screws within the control panel housing. Release these and remove the old board.
7.  **Install the New Board:** Place the new control board into the housing. Secure it as the old one was.
8.  **Reconnect Wires:** Using your photos as a guide, carefully reattach all wire harnesses to the new board. Ensure all connections are firm and in the correct locations.
9.  **Reassemble:** Put the control panel assembly back into place. Secure it with its screws. Then, reattach the top panel.
10. **Test:** Plug the dryer back in. Run a test cycle to ensure the problem is resolved. The dryer should now stop correctly.

This repair requires patience and attention to detail. If you are not comfortable with electronic components, consider calling a professional.

### Troubleshooting Your Samsung Dryer's Moisture Sensor

Samsung dryers often use a moisture sensor system. This system detects when clothes are dry. It then signals the dryer to stop the cycle. This feature saves energy and prevents over-drying. The moisture sensor typically consists of two metal strips inside the dryer drum. As clothes tumble, they touch these strips. If clothes are wet, they conduct electricity between the strips. When clothes are dry, they no longer conduct electricity. This tells the dryer the cycle is complete. If these sensors are dirty, damaged, or faulty, they can give incorrect readings. A dirty sensor might always detect moisture. This would trick the dryer into running continuously.

The moisture sensor strips are usually located on the front bulkhead inside the dryer drum. They are easy to spot. They look like two small, parallel metal bars. Over time, lint, fabric softener residue, or mineral deposits can build up on these strips. This buildup acts as an insulator. It prevents the sensor from accurately detecting moisture. As a result, the dryer thinks the clothes are still wet, even when they are not. This causes the dryer to run longer and longer, sometimes indefinitely. Regular cleaning of these sensors is a simple maintenance task. It can prevent many drying problems, including continuous running. This is just one aspect of keeping your dryer clean, which is important for overall performance.

#### Cleaning Moisture Sensor Strips

Cleaning the moisture sensor strips is a quick and easy maintenance step. It should be your first action if you suspect sensor issues.

**Steps to Clean:**

1.  **Unplug the Dryer:** Always disconnect the power before starting any maintenance.
2.  **Locate Sensors:** Open the dryer door. Look inside the drum, typically on the front bulkhead near the lint trap. You will see two or more metal strips.
3.  **Clean with Rubbing Alcohol:** Dampen a clean cloth or cotton swab with rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol).
4.  **Wipe Thoroughly:** Vigorously wipe down each metal strip. Remove all visible residue, lint, and film. Do not use abrasive cleaners or steel wool, as these can scratch the sensors.
5.  **Let Dry:** Allow the sensors to air dry completely before using the dryer.
6.  **Test:** Plug the dryer back in and run a test cycle. See if the dryer stops as expected.

#### Testing and Replacing a Defective Sensor

If cleaning does not solve the issue, the moisture sensor itself might be defective. Testing the sensor requires a multimeter and a bit more access.

**Steps to Test and Replace:**

1.  **Unplug the Dryer:** Ensure the dryer is disconnected from power.
2.  **Access the Sensor Wires:** You may need to remove the front panel of the dryer to access the wiring connected to the moisture sensor strips.
3.  **Disconnect Wires:** Carefully disconnect the wires leading to the moisture sensor strips. Note their original positions.
4.  **Test for Continuity (Resistance):**
    *   Set your multimeter to measure resistance (Ohms).
    *   Touch the probes to the two terminals of the moisture sensor.
    *   When the sensor strips are dry and clean, they should show very high resistance or an open circuit.
    *   When you wet your finger and touch both strips simultaneously, the resistance should drop significantly, indicating conductivity.
    *   If the sensor always shows conductivity (low resistance) even when dry, or always shows open (high resistance) even when wet, it is likely faulty.
5.  **Remove and Replace (if defective):** If the sensor is bad, remove the mounting screws or clips holding it in place. Install the new sensor assembly.
6.  **Reconnect Wires:** Reattach the wires to the new sensor.
7.  **Reassemble and Test:** Put the dryer back together. Plug it in and test a cycle to ensure it stops correctly.

A bad moisture sensor can make your Samsung dryer run too long, or even indefinitely. This problem can be similar to other drying issues. Sometimes, a dryer may not start at all, which is a different diagnostic path.

### Checking for a Stuck Start Button or Other Panel Issues

Sometimes, the issue isn't deep inside the dryer. It can be right on the surface: the control panel. A start button or other cycle button can get physically stuck in the "on" position. This continuously sends a signal to the control board. The board interprets this as a command to keep running. This is a simple mechanical problem. Lint, dirt, or even a sticky spill can cause buttons to jam. Inspecting the control panel for any stuck buttons or visual damage is an important first step. This check requires no tools. It only takes a few moments. It can save you from more complex troubleshooting.

The user interface panel contains all the buttons and the display. Problems with this panel can cause various erratic behaviors. Besides a stuck button, internal circuit issues within the panel itself can occur. For instance, a short circuit might perpetually activate a function. This tells the dryer to run. While less common than a door switch or control board problem, it is still a possibility. It is worth investigating before you disassemble major parts of your dryer. This step helps rule out external causes before moving to internal diagnostics.

#### Inspecting the User Interface Panel

Follow these steps to check your control panel for issues:

1.  **Unplug the Dryer:** Always unplug the dryer from the power outlet before inspecting.
2.  **Visual Inspection:** Look closely at all buttons on the control panel.
    *   Press each button individually. Ensure it depresses fully and springs back out smoothly.
    *   Check for any buttons that appear sunken, crooked, or stuck inward.
    *   Look for any signs of spills or sticky residue around the buttons.
3.  **Gentle Wiggle/Clean:**
    *   If a button feels stiff or stuck, gently try to wiggle it free.
    *   You can use a cotton swab dampened with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Carefully clean around the edges of the stuck button. This might dislodge any debris.
4.  **Check for Panel Damage:** Look for cracks, dents, or signs of water damage on the control panel surface. Water ingress can cause internal shorts.
5.  **Test After Cleaning/Wiggling:** Plug the dryer back in. Try to start a cycle. See if the dryer stops correctly.

If a button is physically damaged and stuck, you may need to replace the entire control panel assembly. However, sometimes freeing a stuck button is all it takes.

### The Motor Relay and Its Role in Continuous Drying

The motor relay is an electrical switch. It controls the power supply to the dryer's motor. When you start a cycle, the control board sends a signal to this relay. The relay then closes its contacts. This allows electricity to flow to the motor. The motor then starts spinning the drum. When the cycle ends, or if a fault occurs, the control board signals the relay to open. This cuts power to the motor, making it stop. If the motor relay malfunctions, it can get stuck in the "closed" position. This means it continuously sends power to the motor. This causes the dryer to run non-stop, even when it should be off.

A stuck motor relay is a less common issue than a faulty door switch or control board. However, it is a possibility. It often requires more advanced electrical testing to diagnose. The motor relay is typically located on the main control board. Sometimes, it might be a separate component near the motor itself. Accessing and testing this component usually means opening up the dryer. This involves working near electrical components. Always ensure the dryer is unplugged before you begin. Safety is paramount when dealing with internal electrical parts.

#### Locating and Testing the Motor Relay

Testing the motor relay involves using a multimeter. You will be checking for continuity across its terminals.

**Steps to Locate and Test the Motor Relay:**

1.  **Unplug the Dryer:** Disconnect the dryer from the power outlet. This is essential for safety.
2.  **Access the Control Board/Relay:**
    *   For most Samsung dryers, you will need to remove the top panel. Then, you will access the main control board. The motor relay is usually a small, rectangular box soldered onto the control board. It will have multiple terminals.
    *   In some older models, a separate motor relay might be located closer to the motor, typically under the drum or near the bottom of the dryer.
3.  **Identify the Relay:** Look for a component labeled "relay" or "motor relay." It is often a black or clear plastic cube with several pins on the bottom.
4.  **Photograph Wiring (if separate):** If it's a separate component, take pictures of its wiring connections before proceeding.
5.  **Test the Relay:**
    *   **On-board Relay:** If the relay is part of the main control board, testing it directly on the board can be difficult. It often requires advanced knowledge of circuit boards. It is often easier to replace the entire control board if you suspect the relay on it.
    *   **Separate Relay:** If it is a separate relay, disconnect it from its wiring. Set your multimeter to continuity mode (or Ohms). Test the "load" contacts of the relay. This is usually the main power path to the motor. When the relay is de-energized (not powered), there should be no continuity (open circuit) across these contacts. If there is continuity, the relay is stuck closed and is faulty. You can also apply a small amount of appropriate voltage to the "coil" terminals of the relay (refer to its diagram if available). When power is applied to the coil, the contacts should close, showing continuity. If they do not close, or stay closed when power is removed, the relay is bad.
6.  **Replace if Faulty:** If your tests confirm the motor relay is stuck or not functioning correctly, it needs replacement. If it's part of the control board, you generally replace the entire board. If it's a separate component, purchase a new, compatible relay for your Samsung dryer model.
7.  **Reassemble:** Install the new relay (or control board). Reconnect all wires according to your photos. Secure all panels.
8.  **Test:** Plug in the dryer and run a cycle. Confirm that it now stops as expected.

Diagnosing a motor relay can be challenging. If you are uncertain, contacting a qualified appliance technician is a wise decision.
