## Factors Affecting Carpet Cleaning Prices in Savannah

Many things influence **carpet cleaning costs in Savannah, GA**. Understanding these factors helps you estimate your cleaning expense. I want you to know what to expect. This knowledge prevents surprises when you get a quote.

### Carpet Size and Number of Rooms

The most direct factor is the size of the area needing cleaning. Companies often charge per room or by square footage. A small apartment with one bedroom costs less than a large house with five rooms. Make sure to accurately measure your areas. This helps get a precise estimate from **Savannah carpet cleaning services**. Sometimes, hallways or stairs count as separate areas or partial rooms.

### Carpet Material and Condition

Different carpet materials need different care. Delicate or expensive carpets may require specialized cleaning methods. This can increase the cost. The current condition of your carpet also matters. Heavily soiled carpets with old stains need more effort and time. This extra work adds to the price.

### Type of Cleaning Method

Professional carpet cleaners use various methods. Each method has a different cost structure. Steam cleaning, also known as hot water extraction, is common. Dry cleaning or low-moisture methods are also available. We will discuss these methods in detail soon. Know that some methods are more intensive or use specialized equipment. This makes them more expensive.

### Additional Services Requested

Base cleaning prices usually cover standard carpet cleaning. Many clients need extra services. These include pet odor removal, stain protection, or deep stain treatment. Upholstery cleaning for furniture is another common add-on. Each additional service adds to the final bill. Discuss all your needs upfront with your **local Savannah carpet cleaner**.

## Average Carpet Cleaning Prices by Room or Square Footage

When you call for quotes, companies will ask about your home size. **Carpet cleaning prices in Savannah** often use two common pricing models. They might charge per room or per square foot. Let me explain these common approaches.

### Per Room Pricing

Many **Savannah carpet cleaning companies** offer per-room pricing. This model is straightforward. They set a fixed price for each standard-sized room. A "room" usually means an area up to 200-250 square feet. If your rooms are larger, they may count as two rooms. Ask your cleaner about their specific definition of a "room." This helps avoid misunderstandings later.

*   **1 Room:** $60 - $100
*   **2 Rooms:** $90 - $150
*   **3 Rooms:** $120 - $200
*   **4 Rooms:** $150 - $250
*   **5 Rooms:** $180 - $300+
*   **Stairs:** Often charged per step or as a half-room ($30 - $70)
*   **Hallways:** May be included in a room count or charged separately ($20 - $50)

Remember these are average figures. Actual **carpet cleaning costs in Savannah, GA**, can vary. Different companies have different pricing scales.

### Per Square Foot Pricing

Some **professional carpet cleaning services in Savannah** charge by the square foot. This method can be more precise for irregular spaces. It also works well for very large areas. The cost per square foot typically ranges from $0.20 to $0.40. You will need to know your total carpeted square footage. Measure rooms accurately or provide your home's blueprint.

*   **Small Area (500 sq ft):** $100 - $200
*   **Medium Area (1000 sq ft):** $200 - $400
*   **Large Area (1500 sq ft):** $300 - $600+

This pricing model ensures you only pay for the exact area cleaned. It offers a detailed breakdown. I find this helpful for budgeting. When looking into how much it roughly costs to get carpet cleaning, square footage can be a useful measure for comparison.
