You can often fix these issues yourself with basic tools.

### Why Your GE Oven May Not Heat Properly

Several components work together to maintain oven temperature. If any one part fails, the whole system suffers. For example, a heating element might burn out. The oven sensor might send incorrect readings. The main control board could malfunction. These failures directly affect how your oven heats. They prevent it from reaching or holding the desired temperature. Identifying the exact cause is important for a correct repair. You can save money by fixing it yourself.

## Troubleshooting the Bake and Broil Elements

The bake and broil elements are essential for your GE oven's heating. The bake element is usually at the bottom of the oven. The broil element sits at the top. Both elements turn red when they heat properly. If your GE oven is not heating the correct temperature, one of these elements could be faulty. Checking them is a straightforward process.

Start by visually inspecting both elements. Look for any visible signs of damage. This includes cracks, breaks, or blisters. A healthy element has a smooth, intact surface. If you see any damage, the element needs replacement. A faulty element will not heat up or will heat unevenly. This leads to temperature inconsistencies.

### Inspecting for Element Damage

Open your oven door and let the oven cool completely. Gently pull out the oven racks for better visibility. Carefully examine the bake element at the bottom. Then, check the broil element at the top. Sometimes, an element might look fine but still be faulty. In such cases, you might need to test it with a multimeter. A multimeter checks for electrical continuity. If there is no continuity, the element is broken.

Replacing an element is a common DIY repair. Turn off the power to your oven at the circuit breaker first. Disconnect the wires from the old element. Then, remove any screws holding it in place. Install the new element and reconnect the wires. Always ensure you use an exact replacement part for your GE oven model. This ensures compatibility and safe operation.

## The Role of the Temperature Sensor

The oven temperature sensor tells the control board how hot the oven is. It acts like the oven's thermometer. This sensor is crucial for accurate temperature regulation. If your GE oven is not heating the correct temperature, a faulty sensor is a strong possibility. The sensor sends electrical resistance readings to the control board. The control board uses these readings to adjust heating.

A damaged or inaccurate sensor will give wrong temperature readings. This can cause the oven to overheat or underheat. Sometimes, the oven might not heat at all. You can usually find the temperature sensor inside the oven cavity. It is often a thin metal probe sticking out from the back wall. Testing this sensor requires a multimeter.

### Testing and Replacing the Oven Sensor

Before testing, unplug your oven or turn off its power. Locate the temperature sensor inside the oven. Disconnect the sensor's wires. Use a multimeter to measure the sensor's resistance. Consult your GE oven's service manual for the correct resistance values. These values vary with temperature. For instance, at room temperature, a sensor might read around 1080 ohms. If your sensor's reading is far off, or shows no resistance (open circuit), it is faulty.

Replacing the sensor is often simple. Unscrew the mounting screws that hold the sensor in place. Pull the sensor out from the oven cavity. You may need to gently pull the wire through the back. Install the new sensor by reversing these steps. Ensure all connections are secure. A working temperature sensor helps your GE oven heat precisely. This ensures your food cooks perfectly every time. If you notice issues with other brands, similar sensor problems can affect models like a [Wolf oven not heating up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-wolf-oven-not-heating-up) or a [Whirlpool oven not getting up to temperature](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-whirlpool-oven-not-getting-up-to-temperature), indicating a common point of failure across various brands.

## Issues with the Oven Igniter (Gas Models)

For GE gas ovens, the igniter is a critical component for heating. It does two jobs. First, it gets hot enough to ignite the gas flowing into the burner. Second, it acts as a safety device. It senses if the gas has ignited. If not, it signals the gas valve to shut off. If your GE oven is not heating the correct temperature and you have a gas model, the igniter is a common suspect.

A weak or failing igniter may not get hot enough to ignite the gas. The gas will flow but not light. This means no heat. Sometimes, the igniter glows but takes too long to ignite the gas. This can also lead to incomplete heating. You will notice the oven struggling to reach the set temperature. Or it might fail to heat at all.

### How to Check the Igniter

To check the igniter, you need to observe its behavior. Turn on your gas oven to a bake setting. Listen for the click of the gas valve. Then, watch the igniter. It should begin to glow orange. A strong igniter glows brightly. It should ignite the gas within 30 to 90 seconds. If it glows faintly, or if it takes longer than 90 seconds to ignite the gas, it is likely weak. A weak igniter should be replaced. If the igniter does not glow at all, it is completely faulty.

Replacing a gas oven igniter involves working with gas lines. It is important to turn off the gas supply to the oven first. Also, unplug the oven from power. Access the igniter, usually located near the gas burner tube. Disconnect the wires and remove the old igniter. Install the new igniter carefully. Ensure all connections are tight. Turn the gas and power back on. Test the oven. Replacing the igniter can often resolve heating issues in gas GE ovens.

## Control Board Malfunctions and Wiring Problems

The control board is the "brain" of your GE oven. It manages all oven functions, including temperature regulation. It receives input from the temperature sensor. It then sends signals to the heating elements or igniter. If your GE oven is not heating the correct temperature, a faulty control board could be the cause. This part can fail due to power surges, age, or manufacturing defects. A control board malfunction means incorrect signals get sent. This leads to improper heating cycles.

Wiring problems also contribute to heating issues. Loose, burnt, or corroded wires can interrupt electrical flow. This prevents components from receiving power. For example, a bad wire to the bake element means it won't heat up. Inspecting wires for damage is important.

### Diagnosing Control Board and Wiring Issues

Diagnosing a control board issue can be tricky. There are often no visible signs of damage. If you have checked all other components (elements, sensor, igniter) and they appear fine, the control board is a strong suspect. Look for error codes on your oven's display. These codes can sometimes point to specific board failures. Resetting the oven by unplugging it for a few minutes might temporarily resolve minor glitches. If the problem persists, the board might need replacement.

For wiring, turn off the oven's power completely. Carefully inspect all visible wires connected to the heating elements, temperature sensor, and control board. Look for discoloration, fraying, or loose connections. Secure any loose wires. Replace any damaged wires. If you are unsure about working with electrical components, it is best to consult a professional. Wiring issues can be dangerous if not handled correctly. A qualified technician can safely diagnose and repair these complex electrical problems.

## Door Seal and Calibration Concerns

Your GE oven's door seal is vital for maintaining temperature. The gasket around the oven door traps hot air inside. If this seal is worn, cracked, or loose, hot air escapes. This means your GE oven is not heating the correct temperature consistently. The oven will work harder to maintain heat, using more energy. Food will cook unevenly. You might notice longer cooking times.

Oven calibration is another factor. Ovens can sometimes be slightly off from the factory setting. Or they can drift over time. This means the temperature shown on the display is not the actual temperature inside the oven. A minor calibration adjustment can fix these small temperature discrepancies. This ensures precise cooking results.

### Checking the Door Seal and Calibrating Your Oven

To check the door seal, close the oven door. Place a dollar bill half in and half out, then try to pull it out. If it pulls out easily, the seal is weak. You can also visually inspect the entire gasket for gaps, tears, or brittleness. A damaged door seal needs replacement. Replacing the seal is usually straightforward. You can often pull the old one off and push a new one into place. Ensuring a tight seal is crucial for efficient heating. You might also want to understand [how to remove GE oven door without hinge latches](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-ge-oven-door-without-hinge-latches-without) if you need to replace the seal or access other components behind the door.

For calibration, you will need an accurate oven thermometer. Place it inside the oven. Set the oven to a specific temperature, like 350°F. Let it preheat for at least 20 minutes. Read the thermometer. If the thermometer shows a different temperature than the display, your oven needs calibration. Most GE ovens allow for a temperature offset adjustment. Check your oven's user manual for specific instructions. Usually, you press a combination of buttons to enter a calibration mode. You can then adjust the temperature up or down in small increments. This fine-tunes your oven's accuracy.

## Other Less Common Causes and Professional Help

While heating elements, sensors, igniters, and control boards are the main culprits, other issues can cause a GE oven to not heat the correct temperature. These problems are less common but still possible. Understanding them helps in a complete diagnosis. Sometimes, a thermal fuse might blow. This fuse is a safety device. It cuts off power if the oven overheats. If it blows, the oven gets no power and won't heat at all. Power supply issues can also prevent proper heating.

Before calling a professional, ensure your oven is receiving adequate power. Check the circuit breaker. A tripped breaker means no power. Resetting it might solve the problem. If the outlet itself is faulty, the oven won't get enough electricity. A voltage test can confirm this. Remember to always prioritize safety. Disconnect power before checking electrical components.
