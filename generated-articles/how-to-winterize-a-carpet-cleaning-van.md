## Draining the Water System: Preventing Costly Freezes

The most crucial step in winterizing a carpet cleaning van is removing all water. Any water left in the system will freeze. This will cause severe damage. You must drain every component that holds water. This includes solution tanks, waste tanks, pumps, and hoses. Even a small amount of residual water can expand and crack a critical part.

Start with the largest components. Drain the fresh water solution tank first. Open all drain valves completely. Let the water flow out until nothing remains. Next, tackle the waste water recovery tank. This tank holds dirty water from jobs. It must be emptied and thoroughly rinsed. Lingering debris can also cause issues.

Move on to the more intricate parts. The pump system is vital. Many truckmount units have multiple pumps. Each pump needs to be drained. Some units have drain plugs specifically for the pumps. Consult your equipment's manual for exact locations. You might need to run the pump briefly without water to clear it. Be careful not to run it dry for too long.

*   **Solution and Waste Tanks:**
    *   Locate the drain valves for both tanks.
    *   Open them fully. Allow all water to exit.
    *   Tilt the van slightly if possible to ensure complete drainage.
    *   Rinse the waste tank thoroughly to remove sludge.
*   **Pumps and Filters:**
    *   Identify all pumps in your system.
    *   Open their specific drain valves or plugs.
    *   Remove any in-line filters. Clean them out.
    *   Allow pumps to purge any remaining water.
*   **Hoses and Wands:**
    *   Disconnect all hoses from the van.
    *   Lift each hose section vertically to drain water from both ends.
    *   Store hoses in a way that prevents water from pooling.
    *   Disconnect wands and tools. Drain them completely. Pay attention to triggers and jets.
    *   Properly cleaning your tools before storage is a good practice. Learn [how to clean a machine-made carpet cleaning](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-a-machine-made-carpet-cleaning) for tips on tool maintenance.

## Antifreeze Solutions: Protecting Your Plumbing and Pumps

After draining the water, the next critical step is introducing antifreeze. This non-toxic solution protects any remaining water droplets. It also coats the inside of your system's components. This prevents corrosion and freezing. Using the correct type of antifreeze is vital. You must use specific RV or marine-grade antifreeze. Never use automotive antifreeze in your carpet cleaning system. Automotive antifreeze contains chemicals that are harmful. They can also damage rubber seals and plastic components in your cleaning equipment.

RV antifreeze is typically propylene glycol-based. It is safe for plumbing systems. It will not harm your equipment. It is also non-toxic. This means it will not leave harmful residues in carpets later. Check the product label for its freeze protection rating. Choose one rated for temperatures well below what you expect.

The process involves circulating the antifreeze through your entire water path. You can do this by pouring it into your fresh water tank. Then, run your pump briefly. This draws the antifreeze through the lines. You will see the pink or purple solution emerge from your hoses and wands. This confirms it has reached all parts of the system.

*   **Choosing the Right Antifreeze:**
    *   Select RV or marine-grade antifreeze only.
    *   Ensure it is propylene glycol-based.
    *   Check the freeze protection rating. Aim for -50°F or lower.
    *   Avoid automotive antifreeze at all costs.
*   **Circulating the Antifreeze:**
    *   Pour several gallons of RV antifreeze into the fresh water solution tank.
    *   Attach a short hose or a wand to the vacuum and solution lines.
    *   Briefly run your solution pump. This pulls antifreeze through the lines.
    *   Open all valves on your system one by one. This ensures antifreeze reaches every corner.
    *   Look for the colored antifreeze to flow out of each line. This confirms coverage.
    *   Remember to open the bypass valves and any spray nozzles. Ensure antifreeze goes through them.
    *   Do not forget the recovery tank suction line. Pour a small amount directly into it.
*   **Protecting Specific Components:**
    *   Inject a small amount of antifreeze into the solution pump head.
    *   For external filters, remove and clean them. Store them warm.
    *   Ensure all low points in your system have antifreeze.

I usually run about 3-5 gallons of antifreeze through my system. The exact amount depends on the system size. This step is like winterizing an RV's water system. Many principles are the same. For instance, protecting water lines in an RV refrigerator is a similar concept.
