This means a Midea factory might produce appliances that are then sold under a different company's name.

This practice is common in the appliance industry. Many brands, even famous ones, do not own their own factories. Instead, they rely on large manufacturers like Midea to produce their goods. This allows brands to focus on marketing and sales. It also enables manufacturers like Midea to maximize their production capacity. This hidden aspect of manufacturing is quite interesting.

It shows their interest in advanced manufacturing.

In the home appliance sector, Midea's portfolio includes brands that might be familiar to you. These brands cater to different market segments or regions. This layered approach allows Midea to compete effectively across various price points and consumer demographics.
