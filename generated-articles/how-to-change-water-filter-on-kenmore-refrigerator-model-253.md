### Clear, Concise Answer:

To change the water filter on a Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253, locate the filter cartridge, usually inside the refrigerator compartment or in the grill at the bottom. Twist the old filter counter-clockwise to remove it. Insert the new filter, twisting clockwise until secure. Finally, flush several gallons of water through the dispenser to clear air and carbon.

## Why Change Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 Water Filter?

Changing the water filter in your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 is more than a chore; it is a vital part of home maintenance. Over time, your refrigerator's water filter collects impurities. These impurities include chlorine, sediment, rust, and other dissolved solids from your tap water. As the filter traps these particles, its effectiveness decreases.

An old filter can no longer provide clean water. You might notice changes in water taste or odor. The water flow from the dispenser can also slow down significantly. This happens because the trapped particles clog the filter material. A clogged filter makes the refrigerator work harder to push water through. This can strain the water dispensing system. It can also reduce the lifespan of other components.

Clean water benefits your health. Filters reduce substances that can affect health or cause unpleasant tastes. Furthermore, keeping your Kenmore refrigerator's water filter fresh protects the appliance itself. It prevents sediment buildup in the water lines and ice maker. This helps avoid potential leaks or blockages. It also ensures the ice tastes as good as the water.

## Identifying Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 Filter Type and Location

Knowing your specific Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 filter type and its exact location is the first step. Kenmore refrigerators can have various filter designs. These designs are often based on their model number and refrigerator style. For the Model 253, the water filter is typically located in one of two places. It is either inside the fresh food compartment or behind the kick plate at the bottom front of the refrigerator.

Many Kenmore Model 253 refrigerators feature an internal filter. This internal filter often sits in the upper right corner of the fresh food section ceiling. It might be hidden behind a small cover or a flip-down door. Other variations might place it vertically on the left side wall inside the refrigerator. Less commonly, some Kenmore models have a filter that slides into a housing at the bottom grille. You twist it out from the front.

To confirm your filter type, you can consult your refrigerator's owner's manual. The manual provides diagrams and specific instructions for your exact model. If you do not have the manual, look for a small knob, lever, or push-button mechanism. This mechanism usually marks the filter housing. Once you find it, note the part number printed on the filter itself. This number is essential for buying the correct replacement. Most Kenmore 253 models use a twist-in style filter.

## Essential Tools and Supplies for Filter Replacement

Before you start changing your water filter, gather a few basic items. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and quick. You do not need many tools for this task. Most of the time, you just need the new filter.

The most important item is the correct replacement water filter for your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253. Ensure the filter is an exact match. Using a filter that does not fit correctly can cause leaks or prevent water flow. You can find the model number on your existing filter or in your appliance manual. When purchasing, verify compatibility with "Kenmore Model 253." While Kenmore sells its branded filters, many third-party compatible filters are available. These compatible filters often offer similar filtration quality at a lower cost.

Beyond the new filter, I recommend having a few towels or a shallow pan nearby. This is important to catch any small drips of water that might occur when you remove the old filter. Even though modern refrigerator filters are designed to minimize spills, a few drops are common. A pair of gloves can be useful if you prefer to keep your hands clean, but they are not strictly necessary. No special wrenches or tools are typically required for twist-in filters. The design allows for hand-tightening and removal.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Replacing the Water Filter on Your Kenmore 253

Changing the water filter in your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 is a straightforward task. I will walk you through each step. This process applies to most twist-in style filters common in Model 253 refrigerators. You can complete this job in minutes.

### Preparing for Replacement

First, locate your water filter. As mentioned, it is often in the upper right section of the fresh food compartment or at the bottom grille. For top-mounted filters, you might need to push a release button or turn a small lever to access it. For bottom grille filters, you might need to open the grille cover. Once you have located the filter, place a towel or shallow pan underneath it. This catches any water that might drip during the removal process. Turning off the water supply to the refrigerator is generally not necessary for most twist-in filters. The refrigerator's design usually incorporates an automatic shut-off valve when the filter is removed.

### Removing the Old Filter

Once prepared, you are ready to remove the old filter. For twist-in filters, grasp the filter firmly. Then, twist it counter-clockwise about a quarter turn or half turn. You will feel it loosen. Once loose, pull the filter straight out from its housing. Some filters have a push-button release before twisting. If yours does, press the button, then twist and pull. Do not worry about a small amount of water dripping out. This is normal and why you have a towel ready. Dispose of the old filter responsibly.

### Installing the New Filter

Now, take your new Kenmore Model 253 water filter out of its packaging. Remove any protective caps or stickers from the O-rings at the end of the filter. Make sure the O-rings are clean and well-seated. These O-rings create the seal that prevents leaks. Align the new filter with the filter housing. There is usually an arrow on the filter and housing that shows alignment. Push the new filter into the housing firmly until it stops. Then, twist it clockwise until it locks into place. You should feel it click or stop firmly. Do not overtighten it. Over-tightening can damage the housing or the filter itself.

## Flushing the System After Kenmore 253 Filter Installation

After installing your new Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 water filter, one crucial step remains: flushing the system. This step is often overlooked. However, it is important for several reasons. Flushing removes air from the water lines. It also washes out any loose carbon particles from the new filter. New carbon filters can sometimes release a small amount of harmless black carbon dust. This dust can appear in your first few glasses of water.

To flush the system, simply dispense water from the refrigerator's water dispenser. You should dispense about 2-3 gallons of water. It is a good idea to use a large pitcher or container for this. The water might spurt or come out slowly at first. This indicates air in the lines. The water might also appear cloudy or discolored for the first few cups. This is the carbon dust clearing out. Keep dispensing water until the flow becomes steady and clear. The recommended amount ensures the system is fully primed and ready for use.

Once you have flushed the specified amount, taste the water. It should be clear, odorless, and have a fresh taste. If you still notice cloudiness or an odd taste, continue flushing another gallon or two. Proper flushing guarantees optimal performance from your new filter. It ensures the water you drink is clean and tastes great.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues After Changing Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 Filter

Even with a straightforward process, you might encounter a few issues after changing your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 water filter. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems saves time and frustration. I will cover the most common issues.

One frequent problem is a slow water flow or no water at all. If this happens, first check if the filter is correctly seated. A filter that is not fully twisted into place will prevent water from flowing. Remove the filter and reinsert it. Make sure it clicks firmly into position. Air trapped in the lines can also cause slow flow. Continue flushing the system. Dispensing more water for several minutes usually resolves this. If flow remains slow, check your household water supply. Ensure the main water valve to the refrigerator is fully open.

Another common issue is water leaking from the filter housing. This almost always points to an improper seal. Double-check that the filter is seated correctly. Ensure it is fully twisted into its locked position. Sometimes, the O-rings on the new filter might be slightly out of place or damaged. Inspect them. If they look faulty, you might have a defective filter and need a replacement. If your [Kenmore refrigerator is leaking water from the water dispenser](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-refrigerator-leaking-water-from-the-water-dispenser) after a filter change, the filter itself is a prime suspect.

Finally, the "Change Filter" light might not reset. If your indicator light remains on, refer to the manual for your specific Kenmore 253 model. Most models require you to press and hold a "Filter" or "Reset" button for a few seconds. Some models may require a specific button combination. Ensure you hold the button long enough. If the light still does not turn off, the sensor or control panel might have an issue, but this is rare after a filter change.

## How Often to Replace Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 Water Filter

Knowing how often to replace your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 water filter is key to consistent water quality. Most manufacturers, including Kenmore, recommend changing the water filter every six months. This recommendation is based on average household water usage and typical water quality. However, several factors can influence this timeline.

Your household's water consumption plays a significant role. If you have a large family or frequently use your water dispenser and ice maker, you will likely need to replace the filter more often. High usage means the filter processes more water and becomes saturated faster. Conversely, a single person using less water might extend the filter's life slightly beyond six months.

Water quality in your area is another critical factor. If you live in an area with particularly hard water or water containing high levels of sediment and impurities, your filter will work harder. It will trap more contaminants, which shortens its lifespan. In such cases, you might notice signs of a failing filter even before the six-month mark. It is a good practice to observe your water quality. If you see changes in taste, odor, or a reduction in water flow, it is time for a change, regardless of the calendar. Most Kenmore 253 models have a filter indicator light. This light signals when a replacement is due. It often turns red or changes color after six months of use or a certain volume of water dispensed.

## Choosing the Right Replacement Filter for Your Kenmore Model 253

Selecting the correct replacement filter for your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 is crucial for performance and preventing issues. Using the wrong filter can lead to leaks, poor filtration, or even damage to your refrigerator's water system. There are a few things to keep in mind when making your choice.

First, identify the exact model number of your existing filter. This number is usually printed directly on the filter cartridge itself. It might also be listed in your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 owner's manual. Kenmore refrigerators often use filters from various brands, including Sears, Whirlpool, or LG, depending on the specific manufacturing partnership. Common Kenmore filter series include "Kenmore 9081," "9082," or "9990," but your Model 253 may use a different one. Always cross-reference the filter number.

You have the option of purchasing an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) filter or a compatible aftermarket filter. OEM filters are made by the same company that manufactured your refrigerator or its original filter. They guarantee a perfect fit and performance. Compatible aftermarket filters are produced by third-party companies. These filters are designed to fit and function just like the OEM version. They often come at a lower price point. When choosing an aftermarket filter, ensure it is certified by organizations like NSF International. NSF certification ensures the filter meets strict standards for contaminant reduction and structural integrity.

When purchasing, whether online or in a store, double-check the compatibility information. The product description should explicitly state that the filter works with "Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253" or list compatible filter part numbers matching yours. Do not guess or assume based on appearance alone. For example, some Kenmore refrigerators might use filters similar to those for bottom-freezer models, but exact fit is key. [Knowing how to change a water filter on a Kenmore bottom freezer refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-water-filter-on-kenmore-bottom-freezer-refrigerator) might give you general ideas, but always verify for your specific 253 model.

## Understanding Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 Water Filter Indicator Light

Your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 likely has a water filter indicator light on its display panel. This light serves as a helpful reminder. It tells you when it is time to replace your water filter. The light typically changes color, often from green or blue to yellow, and then to red, as the filter nears the end of its life.

The indicator light usually works in two ways. It tracks the amount of water dispensed through the filter. It also monitors the time elapsed since the last filter change. Most refrigerators are programmed to trigger the indicator after approximately six months of use or after filtering a certain volume of water. This is usually around 200 gallons. When the light turns yellow or red, it is a strong signal. It means the filter's capacity for trapping contaminants is reduced. Continued use of a filter past its recommended lifespan means your water is no longer being effectively filtered.

After you change the filter, you must reset the indicator light. This tells the refrigerator's system that a new filter is in place. The reset procedure varies slightly between Kenmore models. Generally, you will find a "Filter Reset" or "Water Filter" button on the dispenser panel. You need to press and hold this button for about 3 to 5 seconds. The light should then turn back to green or blue. If it does not reset, check your owner's manual for specific instructions for your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253. Resetting the light ensures accurate tracking for your next filter replacement. It is possible to operate [a refrigerator without a water filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-my-whirlpool-refrigerator-without-the-water-filter), but the indicator light will remind you to put one back in if you want filtered water.

## The Importance of Consistent Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 Maintenance

Maintaining your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 goes beyond just changing the water filter. Regular attention to your appliance can extend its lifespan. It also ensures it operates efficiently. Ignoring maintenance can lead to costly repairs and poor performance. I always advocate for consistent care for all home appliances.

Beyond the water filter, other parts of your refrigerator need periodic checks. For example, cleaning the condenser coils is important. These coils are usually located at the bottom or back of the refrigerator. Dust and pet hair can build up on them. This buildup makes the compressor work harder, increasing energy consumption and potentially leading to overheating. A simple vacuuming or brushing every 6-12 months can make a big difference.

Checking the door seals is another quick task. Over time, door gaskets can become brittle or dirty. A poor seal allows cold air to escape and warm air to enter. This makes the refrigerator use more energy to maintain temperature. You can clean the seals with warm, soapy water. If they are cracked or no longer seal properly, replacement might be necessary. Keeping your Kenmore 253 clean inside and out also helps. Wipe up spills immediately to prevent odors and bacteria growth. By following these simple maintenance tips, your Kenmore Refrigerator Model 253 will serve your household well for years to come.
