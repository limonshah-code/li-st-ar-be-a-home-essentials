## Locating the Identification Tag on Your GE Refrigerator

The first step to determine your GE refrigerator's age is finding its identification tag. This tag holds critical information. It contains the model number and, most importantly, the serial number. The serial number is key to unlocking the manufacturing date.

GE places these tags in common areas. They are usually easy to spot. Sometimes, you might need to look carefully. The tag is typically a sticker or plate. It shows various appliance details.

### Common Tag Locations

GE refrigerator identification tags are often inside the appliance. Check these places first. Open the fresh food compartment door. Look on the interior walls. The right side wall is a common spot. Some tags are on the ceiling inside the fridge. Others may be near the crisper drawers.

For older side-by-side models, check the door frame. It might be on the freezer door frame too. You can also look behind the kick plate at the bottom front. This requires removing a small panel. Always ensure the refrigerator is unplugged before removing panels.

### What to Look For

Once you find the tag, look for specific details. The tag will list the model number. It also lists the serial number. The serial number is a sequence of letters and numbers. It usually looks distinct. It is often labeled "SERIAL NO." or "S/N". The tag may also show electrical ratings or safety certifications.

Make sure to write down the full serial number. Do not miss any characters. Even a single missed character can lead to an incorrect date. Sometimes, the tag can be dirty or faded. Clean it gently if needed. You need to clearly read the numbers and letters.

## Decoding the GE Refrigerator Serial Number for Production Date

The GE serial number is the most reliable way to determine your refrigerator's age. GE uses a specific code within this number. This code tells you the manufacturing year and week or month. However, GE changed its serial number format over time. You need to know which format applies to your appliance.

Understanding these formats is simple. We will cover two main periods. One format applies to refrigerators made before 2005. A different format applies to those made from 2005 onwards. Knowing this distinction is crucial for accurate decoding.

### Understanding GE's Date Code Formats

GE appliances use a consistent system for date codes. This system is found in the serial number. The date code reveals the year and week or month of manufacture. Older GE appliances used a letter-based code for the year. Newer ones use a numerical code.

This system applies to many GE appliances. For example, the process to find the age of a GE dryer is similar. The key is to identify which format your serial number follows. This helps you correctly interpret the date.

### Pre-2005 Serial Number Decoding

For GE refrigerators manufactured before 2005, the serial number typically starts with two letters. These two letters represent the manufacturing month and year. The first letter stands for the month. The second letter stands for the year. This system cycles through letters.

Here is how to decode it:

*   **First Letter (Month):**
    *   A = January
    *   D = February
    *   F = March
    *   G = April
    *   H = May
    *   L = June
    *   M = July
    *   R = August
    *   S = September
    *   T = October
    *   V = November
    *   Z = December

*   **Second Letter (Year):** This letter cycles every 12 years. You need to estimate the decade based on the refrigerator's appearance or your purchase date.
    *   A = 1974, 1986, 1998
    *   D = 1975, 1987, 1999
    *   F = 1976, 1988, 2000
    *   G = 1977, 1989, 2001
    *   H = 1978, 1990, 2002
    *   L = 1979, 1991, 2003
    *   M = 1980, 1992, 2004
    *   R = 1981, 1993, 2005
    *   S = 1982, 1994, 2006
    *   T = 1983, 1995, 2007
    *   V = 1984, 1996, 2008
    *   Z = 1985, 1997, 2009

**Example:** A serial number starting with "FD" means it was made in March. If the fridge looks like it's from the late 90s, the year would be 1999. If it looks older, it could be 1987 or 1975. This system requires some estimation based on the appliance's visible age.

### Post-2005 Serial Number Decoding

For GE refrigerators made from 2005 onwards, the serial number decoding is simpler. The first two characters of the serial number directly tell you the year and month. This format is usually two letters followed by numbers, or numbers and letters. The system changed to a more direct numeric indicator for the year.

Specifically, for appliances made **from 2005 to mid-2017**, the *second* letter of the serial number is the year code. The *first* letter is the month code. This is similar to the pre-2005, but it is the second letter for the year.

*   **First Letter (Month):**
    *   A = January
    *   D = February
    *   F = March
    *   G = April
    *   H = May
    *   L = June
    *   M = July
    *   R = August
    *   S = September
    *   T = October
    *   V = November
    *   Z = December

*   **Second Letter (Year) for 2005-2017:**
    *   R = 2005
    *   S = 2006
    *   T = 2007
    *   V = 2008
    *   Z = 2009
    *   A = 2010
    *   D = 2011
    *   F = 2012
    *   G = 2013
    *   H = 2014
    *   L = 2015
    *   M = 2016
    *   R = 2017 (cycle restarts)

**Example:** A serial number starting with "AR" would mean January 2017.

**For appliances made from mid-2017 onwards**, GE simplified further. The serial number begins with two numbers. The first number represents the last digit of the year. The second number represents the month. This makes it very straightforward. For example, if the serial number starts with "803", it means the 3rd month (March) of a year ending in 8 (e.g., 2018).

Understanding these different methods will help you precisely pinpoint your GE refrigerator's manufacturing date.
