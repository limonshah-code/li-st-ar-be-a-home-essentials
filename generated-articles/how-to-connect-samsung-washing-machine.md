You can often find Wi-Fi capabilities listed in your washer's manual or on its display panel. Ensure your home Wi-Fi network is ready. Samsung smart appliances typically connect to a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band. If your router has both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, make sure you are connecting to the correct one.

A stable Wi-Fi signal is very important. Position your washing machine close enough to your router for a strong connection. Sometimes, placing the router higher can improve signal strength.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Connecting Your Samsung Washing Machine to SmartThings

Connecting your Samsung washing machine to the SmartThings app is a straightforward process. First, open the SmartThings app on your mobile device. You will see your home dashboard. Tap the plus sign (+) icon in the top right corner.

This icon lets you add a new device. From the list of device types, choose "Device." The app will then ask you to select the device category. Find and select "Home Appliances." After that, pick "Washing machine" from the options. The app might automatically scan for nearby devices. If not, follow the prompts to manually add your machine.

Your Samsung washing machine needs to enter "AP mode" for connection. This mode allows your phone to discover it. Most Samsung washers have a specific button combination for this. Check your washer's control panel or user manual for the exact steps. Often, you press and hold the "Smart Control" or "AP" button for a few seconds. The washer's display will show "AP" or a Wi-Fi symbol when it is in this mode.

Once your washer is in AP mode, your phone will find it. Follow the in-app instructions to connect your phone to the washer's temporary Wi-Fi network. After this, your phone will ask for your home Wi-Fi network details. Input your network name and password carefully. The app will then register your washing machine. You can then give your washer a name, such as "Laundry Room Washer." This helps organize your devices in the app. The SmartThings app lets you control many Samsung appliances.

## Troubleshooting Common Samsung Washer Connectivity Issues

Sometimes, connecting your Samsung washing machine might present challenges. Do not worry; many common issues have simple solutions. The most frequent problem is related to Wi-Fi. First, check your Wi-Fi signal strength at the washing machine's location. A weak signal can prevent connection. You might need to move your router closer or use a Wi-Fi extender.

Another Wi-Fi issue is the network band. Remember, Samsung washers typically connect to 2.4 GHz networks. Ensure your phone and washer are on the same 2.4 GHz band during setup. Router settings sometimes block new device connections. Check your router's security settings. Temporarily disabling "AP isolation" or "firewall" rules might help. Always re-enable them after setup for security.

If the app seems stuck or the washer does not respond, try power cycling your washing machine. Unplug the washer from the wall outlet for a few minutes. Then, plug it back in. This can reset its internal systems. You can also try to [reset your Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-reset-my-samsung-washing-machine) if you experience persistent issues.
