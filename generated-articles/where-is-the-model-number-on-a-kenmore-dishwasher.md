## Finding Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model Number

Your Kenmore dishwasher works hard every day. You rely on it to keep dishes clean and sparkling. But what happens when it needs a new part or a repair? The first step always involves finding the model number. This little piece of information is critical for everything from ordering replacement parts to troubleshooting issues or making a warranty claim. I understand this can seem like a small task, but it holds major importance.

This article guides you through all the common and some less common spots to find your Kenmore dishwasher model number. We will explain why this number is so vital for appliance maintenance. You will learn the difference between model and serial numbers. I will give you clear, actionable steps for a successful search. By the end, you will know exactly where to look and what to do with the information you find. Let's get started on this essential task for your home appliance.

### Takeaway

*   **Check the Door Frame:** Look along the inner edges of the dishwasher door frame.
*   **Inspect the Kick Plate:** Access the panel beneath the door at the bottom.
*   **Review Manuals and Receipts:** Your purchase documents often list the model number.
*   **Distinguish Model from Serial:** Understand the purpose of each unique identifier.
*   **Record Information:** Write down the model and serial numbers for future use.

### The Short Answer

You usually find the model number on a sticker or data plate located on the inner edge of the dishwasher door, typically on the left side. If not there, check under the kick plate at the bottom front, or occasionally behind the control panel. This number helps identify your specific Kenmore dishwasher.

## Why Your Kenmore Dishwasher Model Number Matters

Finding the model number for your Kenmore dishwasher is more than just a chore. It is a critical step for proper appliance care and maintenance. This small string of characters acts as the unique identifier for your specific unit. Without it, getting the right support or parts for your appliance becomes a significant challenge. I always tell people to find this number first when their appliance acts up.

Imagine you need a new dish rack or a specific pump for your dishwasher. There are thousands of different dishwasher models out there. Each one might use slightly different parts. The model number ensures you order the exact component designed for your machine. This prevents costly mistakes and ensures compatibility.

### Repairs and Troubleshooting

When your Kenmore dishwasher stops working correctly, a repair is often necessary. Technicians and online guides rely on the model number to diagnose problems accurately. They can look up schematics and common issues specific to your model. This saves a lot of time and effort in figuring out what is wrong. Without the model number, repairs become guesswork, which is inefficient.

Having the correct model number speeds up the diagnostic process. It allows repair services to bring the right tools and parts for the job. This helps them fix your appliance faster. I have seen many times how having this information ready makes all the difference. Knowing your model number makes troubleshooting simpler for you too. Many online forums and manufacturer websites offer model-specific troubleshooting tips. You can often solve minor issues yourself if you have the right information. This knowledge empowers you to maintain your appliance better.

### Ordering Replacement Parts

Dishwashers contain many components that can wear out over time. From spray arms and filters to circulation pumps and heating elements, parts may need replacement. Each part is specific to certain models. The model number is your key to unlocking the correct parts catalog. You need this number to ensure a perfect fit.

If you order a part with the wrong model number, it simply will not fit or function. This means wasted money and wasted time waiting for the correct part. Many online parts retailers and physical stores ask for the model number first for this reason. They want to ensure you get what you need. I always double-check the model number before ordering anything for my appliances. For general information on finding model numbers for other appliances, you can check guides like [how to find your LG dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-lg-dishwasher-model-number).

### Warranty Claims and Support

Kenmore appliances come with warranties that protect your investment. If your dishwasher breaks down while under warranty, you will likely need the model number to make a claim. The manufacturer uses this number to verify purchase dates and warranty status. It helps them track your specific unit.

Customer support representatives also ask for the model number immediately. This allows them to pull up your appliance's specifications and history. They can then offer tailored advice or schedule service appointments. Without it, their ability to help you is limited. Always keep your model number handy, especially during the warranty period. It streamlines any service requests you might have. For instance, finding a model number for a [Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-samsung-dishwasher-model-number) also requires similar attention to detail for warranty purposes.

## Starting Your Search: The Most Common Spots

When you begin your hunt for the Kenmore dishwasher model number, there are a few places that are usually the best starting points. These spots are designed for easy access. Manufacturers want you to find this information without dismantling the appliance. I always suggest starting with the most visible areas first.

Most Kenmore dishwashers have an identification tag or sticker. This tag contains crucial information, including the model number and serial number. Knowing where to look saves you time and effort. I find these locations usually work for about 90% of all dishwashers.

### On the Inner Door Frame

This is by far the most common location for a Kenmore dishwasher model number. Open your dishwasher door fully. Look along the edges of the door opening, specifically on the side or top where the door seals against the tub. Many manufacturers place a sticker or metal plate here.

You will often find this tag on the left side, right where the door latch is. Sometimes, it is on the top edge of the door opening. The sticker might be small, so look closely. It usually contains the Kenmore logo, followed by the model number, serial number, and sometimes manufacturing details. This spot is easy to access and rarely gets dirty. Many dishwasher brands, like [GE dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-ge-dishwasher-model-number), also use this convenient location.

### Edge of the Dishwasher Door

While less common than the inner frame, some Kenmore models place the identification tag on the edge of the dishwasher door itself. This means the side of the door that faces the tub when closed. Again, you need to open the door fully to see this area.

Run your hand along the thickness of the door. You might find a sticker adhered to the metal or plastic edge. This location is still relatively easy to spot. It might be less visible if you have a custom panel on your dishwasher door. Make sure to check both the left and right edges. This spot can sometimes accumulate grime, so you might need a flashlight and a quick wipe.

## Exploring Hidden Locations on Your Kenmore Dishwasher

If the model number is not immediately visible on the door or its frame, do not worry. Kenmore dishwashers, like other appliances, sometimes have their identification tags in more discreet spots. These locations might require a bit more effort to access. However, they are still easily reachable without special tools. I always advise patience when looking in these hidden areas.

These locations are often chosen to protect the tag from wear and tear. They ensure the label remains legible over the life of the appliance. Knowing these less obvious spots is key to a complete search. You might need a flashlight for some of these areas.

### Under the Kick Plate

The kick plate is the decorative panel at the very bottom front of your dishwasher. It covers the mechanics underneath. Many Kenmore models hide the model number tag here. To access it, you will need to remove this plate.

Most kick plates are held in place by two screws, one on each side. Use a Phillips head screwdriver to carefully remove these screws. Once the screws are out, the kick plate usually slides out or tilts forward. Look on the back of the plate itself or on the floor of the dishwasher cavity just behind where the plate was. The sticker might be on a metal frame component. After finding the number, remember to reattach the kick plate securely. For other brands, like [Whirlpool dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-whirlpool-dishwasher-model-number), the kick plate is also a common location.

### Behind the Control Panel

This location is less common for Kenmore dishwashers, but it is worth checking if all other spots yield no results. The control panel sits at the top front of your dishwasher door, usually where the buttons or digital display are. Accessing this area typically involves removing the inner door panel. This can be more involved.

I recommend exercising caution if you choose this route. You usually need to open the dishwasher door and remove screws along the inner edge of the door panel. This allows the outer control panel to separate slightly. Look for a sticker on the inside of the outer door panel or the back of the control panel assembly. If you are uncomfortable with this step, consider trying other methods first or seeking professional help.

### Near the Drain Pump

Sometimes, the model number can be found near the drain pump or motor assembly. This area is typically located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, usually under the kick plate as well. You might need to peek underneath the machine with a flashlight.

This spot is harder to see without pulling the dishwasher out slightly. I generally only recommend checking here as a last resort. If you have already removed the kick plate, look towards the back of the exposed area. The tag might be on a motor housing or on the base frame. Be careful not to touch any electrical components. For most people, the door frame or kick plate will be the successful spot.

## Deciphering the Identification Tag: Model vs. Serial

Once you locate the tag, you will see a series of numbers and letters. It is important to know which one is the model number and which is the serial number. They both identify your appliance, but they serve different purposes. Understanding this distinction saves you from providing incorrect information. I see many people confuse these two important identifiers.

The tag might also include other details. This could be manufacturing dates or specific product codes. Focus on the primary identifiers for now. They are the most crucial for parts and service.

### Understanding the Model Number

The model number uniquely identifies the specific design or type of your Kenmore dishwasher. It tells you which version of the appliance you own. For example, all Kenmore dishwashers of a "Model X" will share the same model number. This number dictates what parts fit and what features your dishwasher has. It is like the blueprint number for your appliance.

Kenmore model numbers often start with "587.", "665.", or "110." followed by a series of digits and sometimes letters. These first few digits often indicate the original manufacturer that made the appliance for Kenmore. For instance, "665" often refers to Whirlpool-made appliances sold under the Kenmore brand. The rest of the numbers and letters specify the exact model within that series. This is the number you need for ordering parts and finding manuals. You can find similar information when searching for other brands, like with a [Bosch dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-bosch-dishwasher-model-number).

### Understanding the Serial Number

The serial number is unique to your individual appliance. Think of it as your dishwasher's social security number. No two Kenmore dishwashers will have the same serial number, even if they are the exact same model. The serial number helps the manufacturer track production batches, warranty information, and service history for that specific unit.

Serial numbers often contain information about the manufacturing date and location. They are typically longer than model numbers and might contain only digits or a mix of letters and numbers. When you call customer service for a warranty claim, they will ask for the serial number. This helps them confirm your appliance's age and history. So, while the model number identifies the type, the serial number identifies *your* specific machine.

### What is a PNC/Service Number?

Some appliance brands, including those that manufacture for Kenmore, might use a "PNC" (Product Number Code) or "Service Number" in addition to, or sometimes instead of, a standard model number format. This is particularly common with European-designed appliances. This number acts as a very specific identifier for the exact production run of your appliance.

A PNC often starts with numbers and contains many digits, sometimes with a dash or a slash. It might be labeled as "PNC," "Service No.," or "Type." If your tag has this, record it alongside the model and serial numbers. It provides additional specificity, which can be helpful for very precise parts lookups. For example, if a part was updated mid-production, the PNC helps ensure you get the right version. This can be especially true for brands like [Frigidaire](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-frigidaire-dishwasher-model-number) or others that have many variations.

## Tips for a Successful Search and Recording Your Info

Searching for a small sticker in a dimly lit space can be tricky. I have learned a few tips over the years that make the process much smoother. Having the right tools and a systematic approach helps immensely. Do not rush this step. Take your time to ensure you find the correct information.

Once you find the numbers, recording them properly is just as important as finding them. This step prevents you from having to repeat the search every time you need the information. A little organization now saves a lot of hassle later.

### Prepare for the Search

Before you even open the dishwasher door, gather a few items. A flashlight or your phone's light is essential, especially for those hidden spots under the kick plate. The area around the dishwasher can be dark. A notepad and a pen or your smartphone's camera are also crucial. You want to record the numbers as soon as you find them.

You might also consider having a soft cloth nearby. Some of the common locations for the sticker can accumulate food debris or grime over time. Wiping the area clean helps you read the numbers clearly. I always keep a small LED flashlight in my utility drawer just for appliance searches.

### Record and Store Safely

Once you find the model number and serial number, write them down immediately. Do not rely on memory. I suggest a few places to store this information:

*   **Appliance Manual:** Write the numbers inside the front cover of your dishwasher's user manual.
*   **Household Inventory List:** Keep a running list of all your major appliance model and serial numbers.
*   **Digital Photo:** Take a clear picture of the identification tag with your smartphone. Store it in a dedicated album.
*   **Email to Yourself:** Send an email with the numbers to your personal email account. This creates a searchable record.

Storing this information in multiple places ensures you can always find it when needed. This proactive step is simple but very effective.

### When to Contact Kenmore Support

If, after checking all the suggested locations, you still cannot find the model number, do not despair. Kenmore's customer support is there to help. Have your purchase receipts ready if possible. They might be able to look up your appliance using your name, address, or purchase date.

You can also try looking up your Kenmore appliance on the Sears PartsDirect website. They often have diagrams and search tools that can sometimes help identify models based on appearance, though this is less reliable. Explain to the support agent what steps you have already taken. They might offer further guidance or suggest a service technician visit. Sometimes the label simply falls off or becomes completely illegible.

## What If You Still Cannot Find The Model Number?

It can be frustrating when the model number seems to have vanished. Sometimes labels get worn, peeled off, or simply placed in an obscure spot. Do not give up yet. There are a few more avenues you can explore to track down this vital information. I have encountered this problem myself, and persistence usually pays off.

These alternative methods might require a bit more digging or external assistance. However, they are often successful when the physical label is missing or unreadable. It is important to exhaust all options before considering professional service solely for identification.

### Check Your Purchase Documents

Your original purchase receipt or warranty card is an excellent source of information. Many retailers print the model number directly on the sales receipt. This is especially true for major appliance purchases. Look through your old emails or paper files from when you bought the Kenmore dishwasher.

If you purchased it from Sears or another large appliance retailer, they might have your purchase history on file. You can try contacting their customer service with your name and purchase date. They might be able to provide the model number directly. This method bypasses the need to search the physical appliance entirely. It is often the easiest solution if you keep good records.

### Contact Kenmore Customer Service

If you have tried everything on the appliance itself and checked your documents, Kenmore customer service is your next stop. When you call, explain that you are trying to find the model number but cannot locate it. They might ask for other identifying details. This could include the approximate age of the appliance, any unique features, or even the serial number if you found that but not the model.

Some older Kenmore appliances might have their model numbers recorded differently in their system. The customer service representative may have access to databases that can cross-reference common issues or design traits with specific models. They might even guide you to another less common location on the appliance based on your description. Be prepared to describe your dishwasher's appearance and features clearly.

### Consult an Appliance Technician

As a last resort, if you absolutely cannot find the model number and need it for a repair, consider calling an appliance technician. When they come to service your dishwasher, they know exactly where to look for these tags. They have experience with many different models and manufacturers. They also have specialized tools and lighting.

An experienced technician can usually find the model number within minutes, even if it is in a very obscure or hard-to-reach spot. They might need to pull the dishwasher out slightly or use boroscopes to see in tight spaces. While this incurs a service fee, it guarantees you get the correct information. They can then proceed with any necessary repairs, saving you further frustration. For instance, a technician looking for a [KitchenAid dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-kitchenaid-dishwasher-model-number) uses similar methods.

## Common Kenmore Dishwasher Model Number Formats

Understanding what a Kenmore model number looks like can help you identify it on the sticker. It is easy to confuse it with a serial number or other random codes if you do not know the typical format. Kenmore, being a brand rather than a manufacturer, sources its appliances from various companies. This means the specific format can vary slightly depending on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). I want to give you a general idea of what to expect.

Knowing the format helps you quickly spot the correct number on a busy label. It also gives you clues about the appliance's origin. This can be useful for very specific parts searches.

### Numeric and Alphanumeric Combinations

Kenmore model numbers almost always start with a three-digit prefix. This prefix often indicates the actual manufacturer of the appliance. Common prefixes include:

*   **110.** (Whirlpool)
*   **665.** (Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag)
*   **587.** (Frigidaire, Electrolux)
*   **363.** (General Electric)

After this three-digit prefix, there will be a dash, followed by a series of digits and sometimes letters. For example, a Kenmore dishwasher model number might look like: `665.13242N411` or `587.40428000`. The digits after the dash specify the exact model. The letters at the end often denote a color variation or a specific revision.

Sometimes, you might see a "C" or other letter at the very end. This usually indicates a specific factory or production line. The model number generally consists of 7 to 10 characters after the prefix. It is distinct from the serial number, which typically has more characters and often includes production date codes. Even for other brands like a [Maytag dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-maytag-dishwasher-model-number), you will find similar numeric patterns.

### Where to Find Manufacturing Date

The manufacturing date is usually embedded within the serial number or printed separately on the identification tag. If it is within the serial number, it might be a series of four digits representing the year and week (YYWW). For example, a serial number containing "1835" might indicate the 35th week of 2018.

Sometimes, the manufacturing date is explicitly stated as "DOM" (Date of Manufacture) or "MFG Date" on the label. This is often in a standard month/day/year format. Knowing the manufacturing date is useful for tracking warranty periods or understanding if your appliance is part of a known recall batch. Always record this information along with your model and serial numbers. It adds to your complete appliance record.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: Why is the model number so important for my Kenmore dishwasher?

The model number is vital because it uniquely identifies your specific dishwasher design. It ensures you order the correct replacement parts, find the right user manual, and get accurate troubleshooting advice. It also helps customer service and technicians identify your unit quickly for repairs or warranty claims. Without it, finding compatible components or specific support becomes very difficult.

### Q2: Can I find the model number online with my serial number?

Sometimes. If you have the serial number, you can try entering it on the Kenmore or Sears PartsDirect website. They might have a database that links serial numbers to their corresponding model numbers. However, this is not always guaranteed, especially for older models. It's usually easier if you have an account with the retailer where you purchased the dishwasher, as they might have your purchase details on file.

### Q3: Is the serial number the same as the model number?

No, the serial number is not the same as the model number. The model number identifies the specific type or design of the dishwasher, shared by all identical units. The serial number, however, is unique to your individual appliance, much like a vehicle identification number. It helps track its manufacturing date and specific history for warranty and service purposes.

### Q4: What if the label with the model number is worn off?

If the label is worn or missing, start by checking your original purchase receipts, owner's manual, or warranty documents. These often list the model number. If those are unavailable, try contacting Kenmore customer service with any other details you have, such as the approximate purchase date or any remaining visible numbers. As a last resort, an appliance technician can often find hidden or subtle markings.

### Q5: Does Kenmore use unique model numbers for all their appliances?

Yes, Kenmore assigns unique model numbers to each distinct appliance design they sell. While Kenmore does not manufacture appliances themselves (they rebrand appliances from other companies like Whirlpool, GE, or Frigidaire), they still use their own specific numbering system. This numbering system usually includes a three-digit prefix that identifies the actual manufacturer of that particular Kenmore appliance.

### Q6: Can I find it on the user manual?

Yes, your user manual or owner's guide is an excellent place to find the model number. Many manufacturers print the model number directly on the front cover or the first few pages of the manual. If you kept your manual after purchasing the Kenmore dishwasher, always check there first. It is often the easiest and fastest way to retrieve this information without physically searching the appliance.

## Conclusion

Finding the model number on your Kenmore dishwasher is a straightforward but crucial task. You now know the most common locations, such as the inner door frame or the kick plate. You also understand why this specific number is so important for everything from ordering parts to getting warranty service. Knowing the difference between the model and serial number will also help you provide the right information every time.

I highly recommend taking a few minutes right now to locate your Kenmore dishwasher model number. Write it down and store it in a safe, accessible place like your appliance manual or a digital file. This proactive step will save you time and frustration in the future. Having this information readily available empowers you to maintain your appliance better. It ensures smooth repairs and hassle-free support whenever you need it.
