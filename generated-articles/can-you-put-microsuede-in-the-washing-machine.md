## Washing Microsuede: Can You Put It In The Machine?

Microsuede brings a soft touch and elegant look to many homes. It covers couches, chairs, and even clothing items. People love its durability and how it often resists stains. Yet, when it comes to cleaning, a common question arises: "Can you put microsuede in the washing machine?" Many wonder if machine washing will ruin its texture or appearance.

I often get asked about the best ways to care for this unique fabric. Knowing the correct cleaning methods can save your favorite microsuede items. This guide will clarify when and how to machine wash microsuede safely. We will cover preparation, washing steps, and proper drying techniques. By the end, you will feel confident tackling microsuede cleaning tasks.

### Takeaway

*   Always check the care label on your microsuede item first.
*   Pre-treat stains gently before washing.
*   Wash microsuede in cold water on a delicate cycle.
*   Use a mild, dye-free detergent.
*   Air dry microsuede whenever possible to prevent shrinking or damage.
*   Avoid high heat in the dryer.
*   Fluff dried items to restore softness.

Microsuede can often be machine washed, but it requires careful attention to the fabric's specific needs. You must use a gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals and high heat. Always check the care label on your item first for specific instructions. Proper drying is also essential to maintain its soft texture and shape.

## Understanding Microsuede: A Modern Fabric Marvel

Microsuede is a synthetic fabric. Manufacturers make it from polyester fibers. These fibers are very fine, thinner than silk strands. This makes the fabric soft, smooth, and pleasant to touch. It mimics the feel of natural suede but offers many practical advantages.

Many people choose microsuede for upholstery and clothing. It resists stains and spills better than real suede. It is also more durable and easier to clean. The tightly woven fibers help repel liquids. This means spills often bead up on the surface, giving you time to wipe them away. This characteristic makes microsuede a popular choice for busy households.

Its synthetic nature is key to its cleaning properties. Unlike natural fibers, microsuede does not absorb water quickly. This prevents deep stains from setting easily. Understanding these properties helps us care for the fabric correctly. Knowing what microsuede is helps you decide how to wash it. We can then address if you can put microsuede in the washing machine.

## The Truth About Machine Washing Microsuede

Yes, you can often put microsuede in the washing machine. This is good news for many homeowners. However, there are important steps to follow. Not all microsuede items are alike. Always check the care tag first. The manufacturer's instructions are your best guide.

Some microsuede items, especially large or structured ones, might not be suitable for machine washing. Couch covers or smaller throws often do well. For items without a tag or very old items, test a small, hidden area. This helps you check for colorfastness and fabric changes. Using the wrong settings or detergents can damage the fabric. It can cause shrinking, pilling, or discoloration.

I have found that gentle care makes a big difference. Machine washing works when done correctly. It helps maintain the fabric's look and feel. Many people wonder if they can machine wash microsuede. The answer is often yes, with caution and the right approach.

## Preparing Microsuede for the Wash: Essential Steps

Proper preparation is vital before you put microsuede in the washing machine. This step helps prevent damage and ensures a thorough clean. First, remove any loose dirt or debris from the item. You can use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner with an upholstery attachment. This removes crumbs, pet hair, and surface dust.

Next, address any visible stains. Pre-treating stains improves washing results. Apply a small amount of mild liquid detergent or a fabric stain remover. Dab it gently onto the stain with a clean cloth. Do not rub vigorously, as this can spread the stain or damage the fibers. Let the pre-treatment sit for a few minutes, following product instructions.

If the item is large, like a couch cover, check for zippers or ties. Make sure all zippers are closed. This prevents them from snagging other items or damaging the washing machine drum. For items with removable parts, wash them separately if recommended. These steps ensure your microsuede items get the best care during washing.

## The Right Way to Machine Wash Microsuede: Settings and Detergent

When it's time to put microsuede in the washing machine, select the right settings. Use a delicate or gentle cycle. This setting minimizes agitation, protecting the fabric fibers. Hot water can cause microsuede to shrink or lose its soft texture. Always opt for cold water for both washing and rinsing cycles. Cold water helps maintain the fabric's integrity and color.

Choose your detergent carefully. I always recommend a mild, liquid detergent. Look for formulas free of dyes and harsh chemicals. Powdered detergents sometimes leave residue on synthetic fabrics. Avoid using bleach, even color-safe bleach. Bleach can strip the color and weaken microsuede fibers. A small amount of detergent is usually enough. Too much soap can be hard to rinse out and may leave a sticky film. If you've ever dealt with [what to do if too much soap in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-to-do-if-too-much-soap-in-washing-machine), you know how important proper detergent use is.

To protect the fabric further, wash microsuede items alone or with similar delicate items. Avoid washing them with heavy fabrics like towels or jeans. These can create friction and cause pilling. Consider placing smaller microsuede items in a mesh laundry bag. This offers an extra layer of protection during the wash cycle. For specific guidance on loading your machine, remember that [how full washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be) plays a role in effective cleaning and preventing damage. Overloading can reduce cleaning effectiveness and strain your machine.

## Drying Microsuede After Washing: Preserve Softness

Drying microsuede correctly is as important as washing it. Incorrect drying can cause shrinking or damage the fabric's soft feel. The best method is air drying. After removing your microsuede item from the washing machine, gently reshape it. Lay it flat on a clean, dry surface or hang it over a drying rack. Ensure good air circulation around the item. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can fade colors over time.

If you must use a dryer, choose the lowest heat setting. A "no heat" or "air fluff" cycle is ideal. High heat can melt the synthetic fibers of microsuede, causing them to stiffen or shrink. Place a few clean tennis balls or dryer balls in the dryer with the microsuede. These can help fluff the fabric and prevent stiffness. Check the item frequently. Remove it while it is still slightly damp.

Once dry, microsuede might feel a bit stiff or matted. This is normal. You can restore its softness by gently brushing the fabric. Use a soft-bristled brush, like a suede brush or even a clean toothbrush. Brush in different directions to lift the fibers. This brings back the original plush texture of your microsuede. Air drying helps prevent many issues, making it my preferred method for these delicate items.

## Cleaning Larger Microsuede Items: Couch Covers and More

Cleaning large microsuede items, like couch covers or large throws, requires extra thought. You can often put these larger microsuede items in the washing machine. However, check your machine's capacity. Overloading your washing machine can prevent proper cleaning and may damage the fabric or the machine itself. My general advice for [how full can you make a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-can-you-make-a-washing-machine) is to ensure there's enough space for items to move freely.

Before washing, remove all inserts or cushions from the covers. Shake out any loose debris. Pre-treat visible stains as you would for smaller items. For very large covers, you might need to wash them in sections if your machine is not big enough for the entire item. Or, consider taking them to a laundromat with industrial-sized washing machines.

Once washed, air drying is highly recommended for large microsuede pieces. Spread them out evenly to dry to prevent mildew and ensure even drying. If you use a dryer, select the "air fluff" or "no heat" setting. Tumble dry with dryer balls to help fluff up the fabric. After drying, reassemble the couch covers. Then, brush the fabric to restore its softness. This method helps maintain the integrity of your larger microsuede pieces.

## When to Avoid the Washing Machine: Spot Cleaning and Professional Help

While machine washing microsuede is often possible, sometimes it's not the best option. For small, isolated spills or stains, spot cleaning is usually preferred. This avoids unnecessary wear and tear on the entire item. To spot clean, blot the area immediately with a clean, dry cloth. Do not rub, as this can push the stain deeper. Mix a small amount of mild soap with water. Dampen a clean cloth with the solution. Gently dab the stained area. Follow up by dabbing with a cloth dampened only with water to rinse. Finally, blot dry with a clean towel.

Items that are too large for your washing machine or have delicate embellishments should not go into the machine. Cushions that are not removable from their covers also fall into this category. If the microsuede item has a tag that specifically says "dry clean only" or "spot clean only," follow those instructions. Disregarding these can cause irreversible damage.

Sometimes, a stain is too tough, or you are unsure about cleaning a valuable microsuede item. In these cases, professional cleaning is the safest bet. Professional cleaners have specialized tools and solutions. They can often clean microsuede without damaging it. This option ensures your cherished items receive expert care. For general washing machine troubleshooting like how to deal with [how to get soap out of washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-soap-out-of-washing-machine), knowing when to call a professional for fabric care is equally important.

## Maintaining Microsuede's Longevity: Tips for Lasting Softness

Taking good care of your microsuede items helps them last longer. Regular maintenance can reduce the need for deep cleaning. I always advise people to vacuum microsuede furniture regularly. Use a brush attachment to remove dust, crumbs, and pet hair. This keeps dirt from building up and embedding into the fibers. Frequent vacuuming also helps maintain the fabric's soft texture.

Address spills immediately. Microsuede resists stains, but quick action is still important. Blot spills with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the liquid or push it deeper. For sticky residues, use a very slightly damp cloth to dab the area. Always follow up with a dry cloth to absorb moisture.

Rotate cushions on microsuede furniture if possible. This helps distribute wear evenly. It prevents one area from becoming flattened or discolored over time. For items like throws or clothing, store them in a clean, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight to prevent fading. With these simple maintenance tips, your microsuede items will stay beautiful and soft for many years.

## FAQ Section

### Can I use fabric softener on microsuede?

No, I do not recommend using fabric softener on microsuede. Fabric softeners can leave a residue on synthetic fibers. This residue can make the microsuede feel stiff or matted. It can also reduce the fabric's natural stain resistance. Stick to mild detergent for the best results.

### What temperature water is best for washing microsuede?

Always use cold water to wash microsuede. Hot water can cause the synthetic fibers to shrink. It can also damage the fabric's texture. Cold water helps preserve the item's shape, color, and softness. Use cold water for both the wash and rinse cycles.

### How do I prevent microsuede from getting stiff after washing?

To prevent stiffness, air dry your microsuede items whenever possible. If using a dryer, select a "no heat" or "air fluff" setting. You can also add dryer balls to help fluff the fabric. Once dry, gently brush the microsuede with a soft-bristled brush. This will restore its soft texture.

### Can I put microsuede pillows in the washing machine?

If the microsuede pillow has a removable cover, you can often machine wash the cover following the delicate cycle guidelines. However, if the pillow itself (with the filling) is microsuede, check the tag carefully. Many pillows need spot cleaning or professional cleaning only. Machine washing an entire pillow can damage the filling.

### How often should I wash my microsuede items?

The frequency depends on usage. For items like couch covers in high-traffic areas, washing every few months might be appropriate. For throws or decorative pillows, washing once or twice a year is often sufficient. Regular vacuuming and spot cleaning can extend the time between full washes. Always wash if there are noticeable stains or odors.

### What kind of detergent should I use for microsuede?

Use a mild, liquid detergent. Choose one that is free of dyes, perfumes, and harsh chemicals. Avoid powdered detergents, as they can leave residue. Do not use bleach or detergents containing bleach, as these can damage the fabric's color and fibers. A small amount of gentle detergent is usually enough.

## Conclusion

So, can you put microsuede in the washing machine? The answer is generally yes, with the right approach. I have shown that understanding the fabric's properties helps greatly. Proper preparation, careful washing, and correct drying are essential for maintaining microsuede's beauty. By following these steps, you can keep your items looking fresh and soft for a long time.

Always remember to check the care label first. Use cold water and a delicate cycle. A mild detergent will protect the fibers. Air drying is always the best option. These simple rules will ensure your microsuede items stay in excellent condition. Do not let cleaning worries keep you from enjoying this wonderful fabric.
