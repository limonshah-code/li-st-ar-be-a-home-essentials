Once you have chosen your ideal location, the next step is to mount the indoor unit. This involves attaching a metal mounting plate to the wall first. Proper alignment and secure fastening are essential for the stability of your Midea Inverter Air Conditioner. I always use a level to ensure everything is perfectly straight.

A crooked indoor unit can affect drainage and overall appearance. Take your time with these steps. Accuracy here makes the rest of the installation easier and more secure.

#### Attaching the Mounting Plate

First, hold the mounting plate against the wall in the chosen position. Use a level to mark where the plate should sit. Mark the drill points for the screws. Ensure these marks are precise.

Drill holes at the marked points. Insert wall anchors if your wall material requires them. Then, securely screw the mounting plate to the wall. Make sure it is firmly attached and does not wobble.

#### Drilling and Pipe Hole Preparation

After the mounting plate is secure, you need to drill a hole through the wall for the refrigerant pipes, drain hose, and electrical wires. This hole usually angles slightly downwards towards the outside. This ensures proper drainage of condensate water. The Midea manual specifies the diameter of this hole.

Use a core drill bit for a clean hole. Once the hole is drilled, insert a wall sleeve or pipe cover. This protects the pipes and wires. It also seals the hole to prevent pests and drafts. This step is similar across many split AC units, including when you [install an LG air conditioner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-an-lg-air-conditioner).

### 4. Connecting Refrigerant Lines and Drain Pipe

Connecting the refrigerant lines and the drain pipe is a critical part of installing your Midea Inverter Air Conditioner. These connections must be leak-free and correctly made. Any leaks can cause your system to lose refrigerant and fail. I always double-check these connections for tightness.

Precision in this step ensures your AC operates efficiently. It also prevents water damage from improper drainage. Take your time to get these right.

#### Flaring and Connecting Refrigerant Pipes

The refrigerant pipes come in two sizes: a thinner liquid line and a thicker gas line. You will need to flare the ends of these copper pipes. Flaring creates a cone shape that fits perfectly into the unit's ports. Use a flaring tool and ensure the flares are smooth and free of cracks. A bad flare will lead to leaks.

Carefully connect the flared pipes to the corresponding ports on both the indoor and outdoor units. Use two wrenches: one to hold the unit's port still and the other to tighten the flare nut. Tighten firmly but do not over-tighten, as this can damage the flare or the port.

#### Ensuring Proper Drainage Pipe Setup

The drain pipe carries condensate water away from the indoor unit. It must slope continuously downwards towards an appropriate drainage point. A consistent slope prevents water from pooling in the pipe or backing up into the indoor unit. This can cause leaks inside your home.

Extend the drain pipe to a suitable outdoor drainage area. Ensure it is not blocked and allows water to flow freely. Some installations may require a condensate pump if a gravity drain is not possible. Ensure all drain pipe connections are secure and watertight.

### 5. Performing Vacuuming and Charging the System

Vacuuming the refrigerant lines is perhaps the most crucial step in the installation process for your Midea Inverter Air Conditioner. This process removes all air and moisture from the system. Air and moisture can severely reduce the efficiency and lifespan of your AC unit. I never skip this step.

A proper vacuum ensures only pure refrigerant circulates. This allows your Midea inverter AC to cool effectively. It also prevents corrosion inside the system.

#### The Importance of Vacuuming

Moisture in the refrigerant lines can combine with refrigerant to form acids. These acids can corrode internal components. Air in the system creates non-condensable gases, which increase pressure and reduce cooling capacity. This forces your Midea inverter AC to work harder.

To vacuum, connect a vacuum pump and a manifold gauge set to the service port on the outdoor unit. Run the vacuum pump until the gauge reads a deep vacuum (typically below 500 microns). Let the pump run for at least 15-30 minutes, then close the valves and turn off the pump. Monitor the gauge for at least 30 minutes to ensure no pressure rise, indicating a leak. This vacuum process is vital for the long-term health and efficiency of your unit.

#### Adding Refrigerant (if needed)

Most Midea Inverter Air Conditioners come pre-charged with enough refrigerant for a standard line length. Check your unit's manual for the specific pre-charge amount and the maximum line length it covers. If your refrigerant lines are longer than the pre-charged length, you will need to add additional refrigerant.

To add refrigerant, you need a refrigerant cylinder and a charging scale. Connect the cylinder to your manifold gauge set. Slowly open the valve to allow the exact amount of refrigerant to enter the system. Always ensure you use the correct type of refrigerant specified by Midea. Overcharging or undercharging can damage the compressor and reduce efficiency.
