### Clear Answer to Main Query

To convert an LG dryer to propane, you must shut off the gas supply, replace the natural gas orifice with an LP orifice from a specific conversion kit, and adjust the gas pressure regulator. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for your LG model and perform leak checks before use.

## Understanding LG Dryer Conversion Needs

Many homes use natural gas for appliances like dryers. However, some areas, or even specific households, rely on propane (LP gas). If you have an LG dryer designed for natural gas but need to connect it to an LP supply, a conversion is necessary. This is not simply a matter of plugging it into a different gas line. The gases have different properties. Natural gas flows at a lower pressure and requires a larger opening (orifice) for combustion. LP gas, on the other hand, burns hotter and requires a smaller orifice.

### Natural Gas Versus Liquid Propane

Natural gas (NG) and liquid propane (LP) are both fossil fuels used for heating. They differ in their composition and how they are stored. Natural gas is mostly methane and is delivered through pipelines. It is lighter than air and dissipates quickly if a leak occurs. Propane is a byproduct of natural gas processing and petroleum refining. It is stored under pressure as a liquid in tanks and vaporizes into a gas when released. Propane is heavier than air and will pool in low areas if there is a leak. This difference in density and energy content requires specific parts for safe and efficient appliance operation.

### Is Conversion Possible for Your LG Dryer?

Most gas LG dryers designed for natural gas can be converted to propane. Your dryer's instruction manual will confirm this. The manufacturer usually sells a specific LP conversion kit for your model. It is very important to use the correct kit. Using the wrong parts can be dangerous or damage your appliance. Check your dryer's model number and find the corresponding kit from LG or an authorized dealer. Remember, this conversion only applies to natural gas dryers. You cannot convert an electric dryer to propane gas.
