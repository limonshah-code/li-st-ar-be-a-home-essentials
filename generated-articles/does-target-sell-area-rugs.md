## Does Target Sell Area Rugs? Your Guide to Finding the Perfect Floor Covering

Stepping into a home, I often notice how a well-placed rug changes the entire feel of a room. Area rugs add warmth, define spaces, and introduce texture and color. Many people wonder about accessible places to buy these home essentials. A common question I hear is, "Does Target sell area rugs?"

You are likely looking for an easy and affordable way to update your home decor. Finding the right area rug can feel like a big task. This article will confirm if Target sells area rugs and provide details on their selection. We will explore the types, styles, and sizes available, both in stores and online. I will also share tips for choosing and caring for your new rug.

### Takeaway

*   Target offers a wide variety of area rugs, both in physical stores and online.
*   Their collection includes diverse styles, sizes, and materials to fit any home decor.
*   You can shop for Target area rugs conveniently online for a larger selection.
*   Consider your room's size, traffic, and existing decor when choosing a rug.
*   Proper care helps maintain your rug's appearance and extends its life.

### Yes, Target Sells Area Rugs

Target absolutely sells area rugs. You can find a vast selection of rugs at Target, suitable for various rooms and decor styles. They offer options for every budget, making it a popular choice for home decorators. Whether you shop in-store or online, Target provides many choices.

### Exploring Target's Extensive Area Rug Collection

Target is a go-to spot for many home decor items, and area rugs are no exception. They carry a surprising variety of rugs for different needs and preferences. You can find rugs for your living room, bedroom, dining room, and even outdoor spaces. Their collection spans many aesthetics, from modern to traditional.

When I first started decorating my own home, I was amazed by the range. Target sources rugs from various brands, including their popular in-house labels like Threshold, Project 62, and Opalhouse. These brands often reflect current design trends while remaining budget-friendly. This makes it easy to find a rug that matches your personal style without spending too much.

Target's rug selection also includes different construction types. You might find hand-tufted, machine-made, or even hand-woven options. Each type offers a different feel and level of durability. Knowing these differences helps you make an informed decision for your space.

#### Sizes to Fit Every Room

Finding the correct rug size is very important for any space. Target understands this need and offers area rugs in many standard dimensions. You will typically find sizes that work for small entryways to large living areas. Popular sizes often include 2x3, 3x5, 5x7, 8x10, and larger options.

Before you shop, I recommend measuring your room and the area you want the rug to cover. This helps you visualize the rug in your space. A rug that is too small can make a room feel disconnected. One that is too large might overwhelm the space. Target's clear sizing information helps you pick the best fit.

For example, a 5x7 rug might be perfect for under a coffee table in a small living room. An 8x10 rug could anchor a seating arrangement in a larger room. Always consider the furniture placement when choosing your size. A good rule is for the rug to extend at least a few inches beyond the front legs of your main furniture pieces.

#### Diverse Materials and Textures

The material of an area rug affects its look, feel, and durability. Target offers rugs made from various materials, catering to different needs. You can find rugs made from natural fibers, synthetic fibers, and blends. Each material has unique properties.

Common materials include:
*   **Wool:** Known for its softness, durability, and natural resistance to stains. Wool rugs feel luxurious underfoot. They are a good choice for high-traffic areas.
*   **Cotton:** Often used for flatweave rugs, cotton is soft, washable, and affordable. These rugs are perfect for casual spaces or kids' rooms.
*   **Jute/Sisal:** Natural plant fibers that offer a rustic, textured look. These are durable and good for natural decor styles. They may not be as soft as wool.
*   **Polypropylene (Olefin):** A synthetic material that is very durable, stain-resistant, and fade-resistant. This makes it ideal for high-traffic areas, outdoor use, and homes with pets or children. It is also very budget-friendly.
*   **Polyester:** Soft, resistant to fading, and often used to mimic the look of wool or silk. Polyester rugs can be a good value option.
*   **Blends:** Many rugs combine materials to achieve specific qualities. A wool-polypropylene blend, for instance, might offer the softness of wool with the durability of synthetic fibers.

When choosing a material, think about where the rug will go. A soft, plush rug might be best for a bedroom. A durable, easy-to-clean synthetic rug works well in a family room. I always consider foot traffic and potential spills.

#### A Spectrum of Styles and Designs

Targetâ€™s area rug selection covers a broad range of styles. Whether you like modern, traditional, bohemian, or minimalist looks, you will likely find something. This variety helps you match your rug to your existing decor. A rug can be the focal point of a room or a subtle background element.

Popular styles you might find include:
*   **Modern/Geometric:** Featuring bold patterns, clean lines, and often a limited color palette. These rugs suit contemporary homes.
*   **Traditional/Persian-inspired:** Classic patterns, intricate details, and often richer colors. These add elegance to a room.
*   **Bohemian/Shag:** Known for their plush texture, vibrant colors, and eclectic patterns. These rugs bring a cozy and artistic vibe.
*   **Solid/Textured:** Single-color rugs with interesting textures. These offer a minimalist look and can add subtle depth.
*   **Farmhouse/Distressed:** Often feature faded patterns or natural textures. They create a cozy, rustic feel.

I find it helpful to browse different styles online first. This gives me an idea of what I like before heading to the store. The right rug can tie all your decor elements together. It creates a cohesive and inviting space.

### Shopping for Target Area Rugs: Online vs. In-Store

Target offers two main ways to shop for area rugs: online and in-store. Each method has its own benefits. Knowing these can help you decide the best way to find your perfect rug. I often use a mix of both when I am searching for home items.

Shopping online provides access to Target's full inventory. The in-store selection is often limited by space. Online, you can filter by size, color, style, material, and price. This makes it very easy to narrow down your choices quickly. You can also read customer reviews and see more photos. This helps you make a confident purchase.

In-store shopping, however, lets you see and feel the rug in person. This is a huge advantage for items like rugs. You can assess the true color, texture, and quality. Sometimes, a rug looks different in a photo than it does in real life. I always recommend seeing a rug in person if you can, especially for a major purchase.

#### The Convenience of Online Shopping at Target.com

Shopping for Target area rugs online is incredibly convenient. Their website, Target.com, features a comprehensive home decor section. You can easily find the "Area Rugs" category and begin your search. The filters are robust, allowing you to specify exactly what you need.

For instance, I can filter for a specific size like "8x10 area rugs." I can also choose a color like "blue" or a material like "wool." This level of detail saves a lot of time. Product pages include multiple images, detailed descriptions, and care instructions. This information helps you understand the rug before you buy it.

One major benefit of online shopping is the sheer volume of options. Target.com has many more rugs than any single store location. You are more likely to find unique styles or specific sizes online. Plus, items can be shipped directly to your home. Or, you can choose in-store pickup, which combines online browsing with in-person collection.

#### The Experience of In-Store Browsing

Visiting a Target store to look at area rugs offers a different experience. While the selection is smaller, you get to interact with the products directly. You can walk on the rugs, feel their pile, and see their colors under store lighting. This tactile experience is invaluable for home decor items.

Most Target stores have a home decor section where some area rugs are displayed. These are usually smaller sizes or popular styles. You might see a few 5x7 rugs or runners. If you are unsure about colors or textures, seeing them in person helps a lot. It avoids the disappointment of a rug looking different upon arrival.

I often use in-store browsing to get a feel for Target's general rug quality and aesthetic. Then, I go online to find the exact size or pattern I want. This hybrid approach gives me the best of both worlds. It ensures I am happy with my final selection.

### Smart Shopping Tips for Target Area Rugs

Finding the perfect area rug at Target involves a bit of planning. With so many options, it helps to have a strategy. I always follow a few key steps to make sure I pick the right rug for my home. These tips help save time and ensure satisfaction with your purchase.

Consider your budget first. Target offers rugs at many price points. Setting a budget helps you narrow down your choices. You can find good quality rugs that are also affordable. Remember that larger rugs and those made from natural fibers like wool will often cost more.

Next, think about the room the rug will go in. Is it a high-traffic area like a hallway or a cozy space like a bedroom? This affects the material and durability you need. Also, consider your existing furniture and wall colors. The rug should complement these elements.

#### Measuring Your Space Accurately

Accurate measurements are the most crucial step before buying an area rug. A rug that is too small or too large can throw off an entire room. I always use a measuring tape to get precise dimensions. Consider the full scope of the area you want to define.

For a living room, measure the main seating area. The rug should ideally extend under the front legs of your sofa and armchairs. This creates a cohesive grouping. For a dining room, ensure the rug is large enough for chairs to remain on the rug even when pulled out. A good rule of thumb for dining rooms is to add at least 24 inches to all sides of your table measurements.

In a bedroom, the rug can go under the bed, extending out on the sides and foot. This provides soft landings when you get out of bed. For a hallway, measure the length and width to find an appropriate runner. Taking the time to measure prevents returns and ensures a good fit.

#### Matching Your Rug to Your Decor Style

The area rug often acts as the foundation for a room's decor. It can either blend in or stand out as a statement piece. Think about the overall style you want to achieve. Do you have modern furniture, or is your home more traditional? The rug should flow with these elements.

A pattern rug can introduce visual interest. A solid-color rug can provide a calm background. Consider the colors already present in your room. Use a color wheel to find complementary or analogous colors for your rug. For instance, if your room has a lot of blues, a rug with oranges or yellows can create an energetic contrast. Or, a rug with different shades of blue can create a calming, harmonious feel.

Don't be afraid to mix patterns, but do it carefully. Ensure there is a common color or design element to tie them together. I often find inspiration from online decor magazines or Pinterest. This helps me visualize how different rug styles work in a space.

#### Considering Durability and Maintenance

An area rug is an investment, so consider its durability and how easy it is to maintain. High-traffic areas like entryways and living rooms need robust rugs. Materials like polypropylene or wool are excellent for these spots. They resist wear and tear better than delicate fibers.

Think about your household. Do you have pets or small children? If so, stain-resistant and easy-to-clean materials are a must. Many synthetic rugs are designed for this purpose. Low-pile rugs are also easier to vacuum and keep clean than high-pile shags.

Regular maintenance, such as vacuuming, helps extend a rug's life. Some rugs might need professional cleaning periodically. Read the care instructions for any rug you consider. Knowing what the maintenance involves helps you choose a rug you can live with comfortably.

### Enhancing Your Space with Target Area Rugs

Area rugs do more than just cover the floor; they transform a room. They add warmth, absorb sound, and help define different zones within an open-concept space. I have used Target area rugs in many of my own projects because they offer such good value and variety. They are a simple yet effective way to refresh any room.

Think about using rugs to create visual pathways. A runner in a hallway guides the eye and adds comfort. A large rug in a living room creates a cozy conversation area. Rugs can also protect your floors from scratches and daily wear. They are a functional and beautiful addition to any home.

Remember to use a rug pad under your area rug. Rug pads prevent slipping, add cushioning, and protect your floor. Target sells rug pads in various sizes. This small addition makes a big difference in safety and comfort.

#### Decorating with Rugs in Different Rooms

Each room in your home can benefit from an area rug. The type of rug you choose should align with the room's function and style. This thoughtful placement helps create a cohesive and comfortable living environment. I always consider the purpose of the room first.

In a living room, a large area rug anchors the main furniture pieces. It defines the conversation area and adds warmth. Choose a rug that allows the front legs of your sofa and chairs to sit on it. This creates a balanced look. For a bedroom, a soft, plush rug adds comfort underfoot. It makes waking up much nicer. You can place it entirely under the bed or just at the foot and sides.

Dining rooms benefit from rugs that can withstand spills and chair movement. A durable, easy-to-clean material is best here. Ensure the rug is large enough so that chairs remain on it even when pulled out. Kitchens can use smaller, washable rugs or runners. These protect floors and add a touch of style.

#### Layering Rugs for Added Depth

Layering rugs is a popular design trend that adds visual interest and texture. It works well in spaces where you want extra warmth or a more bohemian feel. I often use this technique to add depth to a room. It can also help make a smaller rug feel larger in a big space.

To layer rugs, start with a larger, neutral, flatweave rug as your base. Think of materials like jute, sisal, or a solid-colored low-pile rug. Then, place a smaller rug with a more intricate pattern, richer color, or softer texture on top. Ensure the top rug contrasts with the bottom one in some way. This creates a layered look without appearing cluttered.

This method also allows you to experiment with different patterns and textures. For example, a natural jute rug topped with a colorful patterned rug works beautifully. Just ensure both rugs are flat enough to avoid tripping hazards. A good rug pad can help keep both layers secure.

#### Seasonal Updates with Area Rugs

Area rugs are fantastic for making seasonal changes to your home decor. A simple rug swap can completely refresh a room's look and feel. I love using rugs to reflect the changing seasons. It is an easy way to keep your home feeling current and inviting.

For spring and summer, choose lighter colors, natural textures, and breathable materials. Cotton or jute rugs in shades of blue, green, or cream can bring a fresh, airy feel. These rugs often feel cooler underfoot. They match a bright and open atmosphere.

In fall and winter, switch to warmer colors, richer textures, and cozy materials. Wool or plush synthetic rugs in deep reds, oranges, browns, or jewel tones create a warm, inviting ambiance. Shag rugs are perfect for adding extra warmth and softness during colder months. Target's diverse selection makes these seasonal changes very accessible.

### Beyond the Aisle: Other Target Home Essentials

While we are focusing on area rugs, Target offers a vast array of other home essentials. If you are updating your home, you will likely find more than just rugs there. They stock everything from furniture to small decor items. This makes Target a convenient one-stop shop for home improvements.

I often find myself browsing other sections after picking out a rug. They have kitchen appliances, bedding, bath towels, and decorative accents. These additional items help create a complete look for your home. You can coordinate your rug choice with throw pillows, curtains, or wall art.

For instance, if you found a beautiful bohemian rug, you might look for matching throw blankets or unique planters. Targetâ€™s home section is designed to help you style your space cohesively. It's always worth taking a look around their home section.
