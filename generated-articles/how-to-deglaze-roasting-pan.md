## Unlock Flavor: How to Deglaze Your Roasting Pan

Imagine the delicious aroma filling your kitchen as a roast finishes cooking. Beneath that succulent meat, your roasting pan holds a treasure. It has all the rich, browned bits and flavorful drippings. This is where the magic of deglazing comes in. Learning how to deglaze a roasting pan transforms these precious remnants. You can turn them into a spectacular gravy or a flavorful pan sauce. It adds a depth of flavor that elevates any meal.

Deglazing is a simple, yet powerful, cooking technique. It involves adding liquid to a hot pan to dissolve the caramelized bits stuck to the bottom. These bits are called "fond." They are packed with concentrated flavor. This article will guide you through the process. We will cover the tools you need, the best liquids to use, and how to troubleshoot common issues. Get ready to master this essential kitchen skill. You will unlock incredible flavor for your next family dinner.

### Takeaway

*   **Deglaze Immediately:** Work while the pan is hot from roasting.
*   **Choose Wisely:** Select a deglazing liquid that complements your dish.
*   **Scrape and Whisk:** Use a wooden spoon and whisk to release all flavor.
*   **Reduce and Season:** Simmer the liquid to concentrate flavor, then taste and adjust.
*   **Strain for Smoothness:** Strain the liquid if you want a lump-free sauce or gravy.

To deglaze a roasting pan, place it on the stovetop over medium heat after removing the roasted food. Pour in a deglazing liquid like broth or wine. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits, or 'fond,' from the bottom. Whisk the mixture as it simmers and reduces. This process creates a flavorful base for gravies or sauces.

## Unlock Flavor: Why Deglazing Your Roasting Pan is a Culinary Game-Changer

Deglazing is a technique that turns what might seem like cooked-on residue into a culinary goldmine. After you roast meat, poultry, or even vegetables, a layer of browned bits forms at the bottom of the pan. These bits are known as "fond." They are a concentrated source of flavor. They come from the natural sugars and proteins in the food caramelizing during cooking. If you throw them away, you waste so much potential taste.

I remember the first time I learned about deglazing. It was a revelation. Before that, I just washed the pan and lost all that amazing flavor. Now, I see the fond as an essential ingredient. It forms the base for the most delicious gravies and sauces. This process not only captures incredible flavor but also helps with cleaning the pan later. The hot liquid loosens stubborn food particles. This makes scrubbing much easier. It is a win-win situation in the kitchen.

Deglazing your roasting pan offers several key benefits. First, it extracts every last bit of flavor from your roast. This ensures no deliciousness goes to waste. Second, it creates a deeply savory liquid. This liquid becomes the foundation for rich gravies, silky pan sauces, or even flavorful additions to soups and stews. Third, as I mentioned, it significantly simplifies the cleanup process for your roasting pan. The liquid helps dissolve the cooked-on bits, making them easy to remove. This technique is a cornerstone of professional cooking. It is simple enough for any home cook to master.

It truly elevates a meal from good to extraordinary. Next time you pull a golden-brown turkey or a tender pot roast from the oven, remember the treasure left behind. It waits for you to unlock its full potential. Deglazing is an essential step. It separates a good cook from a great one. It is a simple step, but it delivers huge rewards in taste.

## Essential Tools and Ingredients for Successful Roasting Pan Deglazing

To successfully deglaze your roasting pan, you do not need many special tools. Most items you likely already have in your kitchen. Having the right equipment makes the process smooth and efficient. It ensures you capture all that delicious flavor. Let me walk you through the essentials you will need.

First, you need your roasting pan itself. After you remove your roasted food, the pan should still be hot. This residual heat is important for the deglazing process. The heat helps release the fond efficiently. You will also need a stovetop or a heat source. Most roasting pans are designed to go from the oven directly to the stovetop. This is a crucial feature for deglazing. If you are unsure if your pan can go on the stove, check the manufacturer's guidelines. Many people ask, "[Can you put roasting pan on stove?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-roasting-pan-on-stove/)" The answer is generally yes for most metal roasting pans, but always verify.

Next, you will need a sturdy wooden spoon or a heat-resistant spatula. These tools are perfect for scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Metal spatulas can sometimes scratch certain pan surfaces. A wooden spoon is gentle yet effective. I always keep a good wooden spoon handy specifically for this task. It helps to loosen all the flavorful fond without damaging the pan.

A whisk is also incredibly helpful. Once you add the liquid, whisking helps to incorporate the dissolved fond into a smooth, even mixture. It prevents lumps and ensures the sauce or gravy base is consistent. For straining, a fine-mesh sieve is indispensable. This helps to remove any larger food particles or impurities. It leaves you with a silky-smooth liquid. This step is optional, but it makes a noticeable difference in the final product's texture.

Finally, the most important "ingredient" is your deglazing liquid. This can be anything from wine to broth. We will discuss specific liquid choices in more detail later. Make sure your chosen liquid is ready and at room temperature. This prevents the pan from cooling too rapidly. Having everything prepared before you start is key. This prepares you for a successful deglazing.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Deglaze Your Roasting Pan on the Stovetop

Deglazing your roasting pan might seem daunting at first, but it is a straightforward process. Following these steps will help you create a rich, flavorful base for your sauces and gravies. I always find this part of cooking incredibly satisfying. It turns potential waste into culinary gold.

**Step 1: Remove the Roast and Drain Excess Fat**

Once your roasted meat or poultry is done, carefully remove it from the roasting pan. Place the roast on a cutting board or serving platter. Let it rest. This resting time allows the juices to redistribute. It keeps the meat tender and juicy. Now, look at the pan. There will likely be a good amount of rendered fat along with the browned bits (fond) stuck to the bottom. Carefully pour out most of the excess fat from the pan. Leave behind only a thin layer, perhaps a tablespoon or two. You want enough fat to carry the flavor, but not so much that your sauce becomes greasy. Some people ask, "[How to make roasting pan not stick?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-roasting-pan-not-stick/)" While preventing sticking helps, a little bit of delicious fond is what we are after for deglazing.

**Step 2: Place the Pan on the Stovetop and Heat**

Transfer your roasting pan to the stovetop. If your pan is large, you might need to use two burners to ensure even heating. Turn the heat to medium-high. You want the pan to be hot enough to sizzle when liquid is added. Do not let it get smoking hot. This can burn the fond. The goal is to loosen the flavorful bits, not char them. The heat should be just right. This helps to activate the remaining fat and fond.

**Step 3: Add Your Deglazing Liquid**

Once the pan is hot and slightly shimmering, it is time to add your chosen deglazing liquid. This is typically about 1/2 to 1 cup, depending on the size of your pan and how much fond is present. Pour the liquid directly into the hot pan. Be careful, as it will likely sizzle and steam vigorously. The immediate sizzle is a good sign. It indicates the pan is at the right temperature for deglazing.

**Step 4: Scrape and Whisk the Fond**

Immediately after adding the liquid, use your wooden spoon or heat-resistant spatula to vigorously scrape the bottom of the pan. Work quickly to dislodge all the browned bits (fond) that are stuck. These bits will dissolve into the liquid. They will infuse it with deep, roasted flavor. As you scrape, also use a whisk to stir the mixture. This helps to combine the fat, liquid, and dissolved fond into a cohesive base. Keep scraping and whisking until all the fond has come loose from the pan.

**Step 5: Simmer and Reduce**

Allow the liquid to simmer gently on the stovetop. Continue to whisk occasionally. The goal is to reduce the liquid by about half. This concentrates the flavors and thickens the sauce slightly. This reduction process can take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. It depends on the heat and the amount of liquid. You will notice the liquid becoming richer in color and more aromatic. This is where the magic really happens.

**Step 6: Strain and Season (Optional but Recommended)**

Once the liquid has reduced and thickened to your desired consistency, you can strain it. Pour the deglazed liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a separate bowl or measuring cup. This removes any small bits of food or impurities. It leaves you with a smooth, refined sauce base. Now, taste the liquid. Season it with salt and pepper as needed. You can also add fresh herbs, a knob of butter, or a splash of cream to enrich it further. This perfectly seasoned liquid is now ready to be served as a gravy or used as a base for a more complex sauce.

## Choosing Your Deglazing Liquid: A Guide to Flavor Profiles

The choice of deglazing liquid significantly impacts the final flavor of your sauce or gravy. Different liquids bring different characteristics. They complement various roasted foods. Selecting the right one is key to maximizing the deliciousness you extract from your roasting pan. Let's explore some popular options.

**Wine:** Wine is a classic choice for deglazing. It adds acidity and depth, which brightens the rich flavors of roasted meats.
*   **Red Wine:** Use dry red wines like Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, or Merlot for red meats such as beef or lamb. The robust flavors of red wine stand up well to these meats. They create a deep, savory sauce. It is my go-to for a perfect steak sauce.
*   **White Wine:** Opt for dry white wines like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio for poultry, pork, or fish. White wine adds a lighter, brighter acidity. It complements the more delicate flavors of these foods. Avoid sweet wines, as they can make your sauce cloyingly sweet.

**Broth or Stock:** Broth or stock is a versatile and common choice. It adds savory notes without overpowering the natural flavors of the fond.
*   **Chicken or Turkey Broth:** These are excellent for deglazing after roasting poultry. They enhance the bird's natural flavors.
*   **Beef Broth:** Ideal for beef roasts, it provides a rich, meaty base for gravy.
*   **Vegetable Broth:** A good option for roasted vegetables or if you prefer a vegetarian or vegan sauce. It provides a savory foundation without animal products. Ensure it is low-sodium so you can control the seasoning.

**Beer:** Certain beers can be fantastic for deglazing. They add unique malty or hoppy notes.
*   **Light Lager or Ale:** Use these for poultry or pork. They provide a subtle bitterness and earthy notes.
*   **Dark Stout or Porter:** These are great with beef or game meats. They offer deeper, roasted flavors and a touch of sweetness. The robust flavor profile works really well. It adds a delicious complexity to the sauce.

**Water:** While simple, water is a perfectly acceptable deglazing liquid.
*   It does not add any additional flavor. This allows the pure taste of the fond to shine through.
*   Use it if you want a neutral base. It is also good if you are unsure which other liquid to choose. Water is also a great option if you are trying to keep things simple or avoid alcohol.

**Other Liquids:**
*   **Vermouth:** Dry vermouth works similarly to dry white wine. It provides a delicate herbal note.
*   **Cider Vinegar or Balsamic Vinegar (Diluted):** A small amount of vinegar diluted with water can add a bright, acidic tang. Use sparingly to avoid an overly vinegary taste.
*   **Juice:** Some cooks use apple juice for pork or chicken. Make sure it is unsweetened. It provides a sweet and tangy contrast.

Always consider what you roasted and the flavor profile you want to achieve. The best liquid will complement your main dish. It will enhance, not hide, the rich flavors from the pan. Choose a liquid that resonates with your meal. This selection can truly elevate your finished sauce or gravy.

## Troubleshooting Common Deglazing Challenges and Solutions

While deglazing is generally simple, sometimes you might encounter issues. These issues can prevent you from getting that perfect flavorful liquid. Do not worry, I have faced them too. Most common problems have easy solutions. Let's look at some typical challenges and how to overcome them.

**Challenge 1: The Fond is Too Burnt**

Sometimes, especially with high heat or extended roasting times, the bits at the bottom of your pan can turn from beautifully browned to deeply charred. Burnt fond will result in a bitter-tasting sauce. This is something you want to avoid.
*   **Solution:** If the fond is completely black and flaky, it is often best to start over. It is difficult to remove the bitter taste once it is there. However, if only a few spots are burnt, you can try to carefully scrape away just the black bits before deglazing. Leave the good, browned ones behind. You can also try adding a little extra liquid and simmering for a shorter time. You must be careful to avoid infusing the bitter flavor. A quick wipe down before adding liquid can sometimes save it. Learning "[How to clean burnt roasting pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-burnt-roasting-pan/)" can also give you tips for preventing this in the future by managing heat.

**Challenge 2: Not Enough Fond or Drippings**

You might find your pan relatively clean with very few browned bits or liquid. This can happen with leaner cuts of meat or if your roasting pan was made to be non-stick.
*   **Solution:** If there's minimal fond, you can still deglaze, but the resulting liquid might not be as intensely flavored. You can compensate by adding a bit of butter or a neutral oil to the pan before deglazing. This creates a base for the liquid. You can also thicken the final liquid with a cornstarch slurry. This gives it a more substantial texture. If your pan is naturally very clean, perhaps you used foil. "[How to clean roasting pan foil](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-roasting-pan-foil/)" addresses using foil, which prevents fond formation. Remember, a little fond is all you need for great flavor.

**Challenge 3: Liquid Evaporates Too Quickly**

Sometimes, the pan is too hot, or you use too little liquid. The deglazing liquid can evaporate almost instantly. This does not give you enough time to scrape up the fond.
*   **Solution:** Reduce the heat on your stovetop to medium or even medium-low before adding the liquid. If the pan feels excessively hot, you can remove it from the heat for a moment. Then add the liquid and return it to the burner. Use a slightly larger amount of liquid next time. This ensures you have enough time to scrape effectively. Also, make sure your liquid is at room temperature. Cold liquid will cause a more extreme temperature shock.

**Challenge 4: Sauce is Greasy or Too Thin**

After deglazing, you might find your sauce base too greasy or watery.
*   **Solution for Greasiness:** Before adding your liquid, make sure you pour off almost all the excess fat from the pan. You only need a thin film to carry flavor. If your sauce is greasy after reduction, you can chill it. The fat will solidify on top. You can then easily skim it off.
*   **Solution for Thinness:** If the sauce is too thin, continue to simmer and reduce it. This will evaporate more water and concentrate the flavors. You can also thicken it by making a slurry of cornstarch or flour mixed with a small amount of cold water or broth. Whisk this into the simmering sauce. Stir constantly until it reaches your desired consistency. Another option is to whisk in a knob of cold butter at the end. This adds richness and slight body.

By understanding these common issues, you can confidently deglaze your roasting pan. You will create delicious, flavorful sauces every time. Practice makes perfect. Do not be afraid to experiment and adjust as you go.

## Beyond Gravy: Creative Uses for Your Deglazed Roasting Pan Liquid

When you deglaze your roasting pan, the immediate thought is often gravy. While it makes an incredible gravy base, this rich, flavorful liquid has so much more potential. It is a concentrated essence of your roasted food. This means it can elevate many other dishes. Do not limit its use to just one type of sauce. I love finding new ways to incorporate this liquid. It adds depth and complexity to everyday meals.

Think of your deglazed liquid as a concentrated stock. It is brimming with roasted notes and savory goodness. Here are some creative ways to use it beyond traditional gravy:

**1. Flavorful Pan Sauce:**
Instead of a thick gravy, transform your deglazed liquid into a quick pan sauce. After straining, reduce it further until it coats the back of a spoon. Whisk in a tablespoon of cold butter for richness and shine. You can also add fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary. A squeeze of lemon juice at the end brightens the flavor. This simple sauce is perfect over roasted meats, vegetables, or even pasta. It is lighter than gravy. It still packs an incredible flavor punch.

**2. Enhancing Soups and Stews:**
This deglazed liquid is an instant flavor booster for any soup or stew. When making a beef stew, chicken noodle soup, or even a vegetable broth, add a portion of your deglazed liquid. It will deepen the savory notes. It adds a complexity that tastes like you simmered the dish for hours. It works wonders in chili, too. It builds layers of flavor effortlessly.

**3. Risotto or Grain Cooking Liquid:**
Swap out some or all of your regular broth or water when cooking risotto, quinoa, or rice. Using deglazed liquid will infuse your grains with incredible depth. Imagine a risotto made with the rich essence of a roasted chicken or a pilaf cooked with beef drippings. The grains absorb all that wonderful flavor. This results in a much more satisfying and delicious side dish. It is a subtle change that makes a huge difference.

**4. Braising Liquid:**
For braising meats or vegetables, a deglazed roasting pan liquid serves as an excellent base. Combine it with additional broth, wine, and aromatics. This creates a perfect liquid for slow cooking. The flavors will meld beautifully. They will tenderize the ingredients. Your braised dish will be incredibly rich and succulent. It builds on the flavors you already developed during roasting.

**5. Marinades and Vinaigrettes:**
Believe it or not, a small amount of deglazed liquid can add a savory dimension to marinades. Mix it with oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices for an intensely flavored marinade. For vinaigrettes, combine a tablespoon with your oil and vinegar. It will add an umami punch that elevates a simple salad dressing. Just remember to balance its richness with acidity.

**6. Roasting Vegetables:**
Next time you roast vegetables, toss them with a bit of the deglazed liquid before cooking. It will coat them in delicious savory flavor. They will caramelize beautifully. This is especially good for root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, or parsnips. They will absorb the flavor and become incredibly tender.

By thinking beyond gravy, you ensure that no drop of that precious deglazed liquid goes to waste. It is a versatile ingredient. It can elevate many different culinary creations. Get creative and experiment with its uses in your kitchen.

## Maintaining Your Roasting Pan: Post-Deglazing Cleaning Tips

Deglazing your roasting pan is a brilliant way to capture flavor. It also provides a head start on cleaning your pan. The hot liquid and scraping action loosen most of the stubborn, cooked-on bits. This makes the cleaning process much easier. However, even after deglazing, your pan will need proper cleaning. This ensures it is ready for its next use. "[How to keep roasting pan clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-roasting-pan-clean/)" is a common concern, and proper cleaning after each use is key.

After you have poured out your delicious deglazed liquid, you will find the pan significantly cleaner than before. But there will still be some residue. Here is how to finish the job effectively:

**1. Allow the Pan to Cool Slightly:**
While deglazing uses a hot pan, let it cool down a bit before fully immersing it in water or scrubbing vigorously. A sudden temperature change can warp some metal pans. This can happen especially with thinner ones. Wait until it is warm to the touch, not scorching hot.

**2. Scrape Away Remaining Debris:**
Use a non-abrasive scrubber or a plastic scraper to remove any last bits of food or fond that are still clinging to the surface. For especially stubborn spots, a little baking soda can help. Sprinkle it on the spot, add a few drops of water to make a paste, and let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing. This is a gentle yet effective abrasive.

**3. Wash with Hot Soapy Water:**
Fill your pan with hot water and a good amount of dish soap. Use a sponge or dishcloth to wash the pan thoroughly. For stainless steel or aluminum pans, a regular dish soap works perfectly. Make sure to get into all the corners and crevices. If you used foil in your pan, cleanup might be minimal, as discussed in "[How to clean roasting pan foil](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-roasting-pan-foil/)"

**4. For Stubborn Stains or Burnt Spots:**
If you still have stubborn burnt-on spots after deglazing, do not despair. Fill the pan with hot water and a few drops of dish soap. Let it soak for an hour or even overnight. This often softens the remaining residue, making it much easier to remove. For very tough spots, a paste of baking soda and a little water, left to sit for a while, can work wonders. Apply the paste, let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then scrub. For extreme cases, specific methods for "[How to clean burnt roasting pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-burnt-roasting-pan/)" might be needed, but deglazing often prevents this level of buildup.

**5. Rinse Thoroughly and Dry Completely:**
Rinse the pan under warm running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Then, dry the pan completely with a clean towel. Air drying can lead to water spots or even rust over time, especially on certain materials. Proper drying is crucial for pan longevity. This step is often overlooked but is very important.

**6. Consider Pan Material:**
The cleaning method can slightly vary based on your pan's material.
*   **Stainless Steel:** Very durable, can handle most scrubbing.
*   **Aluminum:** Can be prone to discoloration if harsh abrasives are used. Avoid steel wool.
*   **Non-stick:** Use only soft sponges and mild soap to protect the coating.
*   **Glass/Ceramic:** Can usually be soaked and scrubbed with non-abrasive cleaners.

By following these cleaning steps, your roasting pan will stay in excellent condition. It will be ready for your next culinary adventure. Deglazing not only enhances your meal but also simplifies the post-cooking cleanup. It is a dual benefit that every home cook appreciates.

## The Science of Sizzle: Understanding the Maillard Reaction and Fond Formation

When you roast food, something truly magical happens in your pan. It is not just about heating ingredients. It is about complex chemical reactions that create amazing flavors and aromas. This process is called the Maillard reaction. Understanding it helps you appreciate why deglazing is so powerful. It also helps you get the most out of your roasting pan. I find the science behind cooking absolutely fascinating.

The Maillard reaction is a chemical process between amino acids and reducing sugars. It happens when food is heated. This reaction is responsible for the browning and delicious savory flavors of roasted meats, seared scallops, toasted bread, and even coffee. It is not caramelization, which involves only sugars. The Maillard reaction creates hundreds of different flavor compounds. These compounds give roasted food its signature taste. When you "[use oven roasting pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-oven-roasting-pan/)", you are actively encouraging this reaction.

As your roast cooks, moisture evaporates from the surface. The surface temperature then rises. When it reaches around 285°F (140°C) or higher, the Maillard reaction begins. Proteins and sugars on the surface of your meat or vegetables start to transform. They turn from pale to golden brown, then to a rich, dark brown. This browning creates a crust. This crust is packed with intense, savory, nutty, and sometimes slightly sweet flavors. This is the flavor you are trying to capture when you deglaze.

The "fond" that forms at the bottom of your roasting pan is a direct result of the Maillard reaction. These are the flavorful browned bits that stick to the pan. They are not burnt pieces, but rather highly concentrated flavor molecules. As the meat cooks, juices and rendered fat drip down. They combine with the sugars and proteins on the pan's surface. The heat causes these components to brown and caramelize, sticking to the bottom. This creates that dark, crusty layer. This fond is packed with all the delicious flavor that might otherwise be lost.

When you add liquid during deglazing, the process called "solvation" occurs. The hot liquid dissolves these flavorful compounds. It releases them from the pan. The Maillard reaction products are soluble in water and alcohol. This makes them easy to incorporate into your sauce or gravy. The sizzle you hear is the liquid rapidly turning to steam. This steam helps to lift the bits from the pan's surface. The combination of heat, liquid, and scraping effectively harvests all that incredible flavor.

So, when you deglaze, you are not just cleaning a pan. You are actively extracting the delicious chemistry of the Maillard reaction. You are turning browned residue into a rich, aromatic foundation for your meal. This understanding makes the simple act of deglazing feel like a truly essential step in cooking. It unlocks the full potential of your roasted dishes. It ensures that no flavor is left behind.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Deglazing a Roasting Pan

### Can I deglaze a non-stick roasting pan?
Yes, you can deglaze a non-stick pan, but be aware it might not produce as much fond. Non-stick surfaces prevent food from sticking, which means fewer browned bits will form. Use a wooden or silicone utensil to avoid scratching the non-stick coating. The flavor might be milder than with a stainless steel pan.

### What if my roasting pan is too large for my stovetop burners?
Many large roasting pans extend beyond a single burner. To deglaze evenly, place the pan across two stovetop burners. Adjust the heat on both burners to medium. You can also move the pan slightly to ensure all areas with fond are heated. This allows for even deglazing.

### Can I deglaze with water instead of wine or broth?
Absolutely. While wine or broth add more complex flavors, plain water works perfectly well to loosen the fond. It creates a neutral base. This allows the pure roasted flavors from the pan to shine through. Water is a good option if you want to avoid specific flavors or alcohol.

### Do I need to remove all the fat before deglazing?
You should pour off most of the excess rendered fat, leaving only about 1-2 tablespoons in the pan. Too much fat will make your resulting sauce greasy. A small amount of fat is beneficial. It helps carry the flavor and can add richness to your sauce.

### How do I thicken the deglazed liquid for gravy?
After deglazing, if you want a thicker gravy, you have a few options. You can continue to simmer the liquid to reduce it further, concentrating the flavors and thickening it naturally. Alternatively, make a slurry of cornstarch or flour mixed with cold water. Whisk this into the simmering liquid gradually until it reaches your desired consistency.

### Can I store deglazed liquid for later use?
Yes, you can store deglazed liquid. After straining and cooling, transfer it to an airtight container. It can be refrigerated for 3-4 days. For longer storage, freeze it in ice cube trays or small containers for up to 3 months. This is perfect for adding flavor boosts to future soups, stews, or sauces.

## Conclusion

Mastering how to deglaze a roasting pan is a game-changer in the
