**Customer Support:** Rheem has a network of authorized dealers and service technicians. If you encounter an issue, your first step is usually to contact your installer. They have experience with Rheem products. They can diagnose and repair problems under warranty. Rheem also provides online resources and customer service hotlines. These can help with general questions or finding a local technician.

I've found Rheem's support system to be responsive. When I had a question about my unit's settings, I easily found the information online. For more technical issues, their authorized service network is reliable. They know Rheem products well. Knowing [how long is Rheem heat pump warranty](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-is-rheem-heat-pump-warranty) helps set expectations.
