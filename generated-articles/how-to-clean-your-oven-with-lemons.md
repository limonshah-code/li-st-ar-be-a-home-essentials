1.  **Prepare the Lemons:** Slice 2-4 fresh lemons in half. Squeeze the juice from the lemon halves into an oven-safe bowl. Then, place the squeezed lemon halves directly into the bowl with the juice.
2.  **Add Water:** Fill the bowl with about 1/2 to 1 cup of water. Make sure the water level is high enough to cover the lemon halves. This creates the steam needed for cleaning.
3.  **Heat the Oven:** Place the bowl with the lemon water inside your cold oven. Close the oven door. Turn your oven to 250-300°F (120-150°C). Let the oven heat up with the bowl inside.
4.  **Steam the Oven:** Once the oven reaches temperature, allow the lemon water to steam for 20-30 minutes. You will see steam forming inside. This steam will condense on the oven walls. It will begin to soften baked-on food and grease. You are essentially using a [steam clean oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-steam-clean-oven) approach with natural ingredients.
5.  **Cool Down:** After 20-30 minutes, turn off the oven. Do not open the door immediately. Let the oven cool down completely, or at least until it is warm to the touch. This can take an hour or more. The steam continues to work during this cooling period.
6.  **Wipe Away Grime:** Once cool, carefully remove the bowl. Dip a sponge or microfiber cloth into the lemon water in the bowl. Use this to wipe down the inside surfaces of your oven.

### Tackling Stubborn Grease and Stains

Sometimes, regular wiping with lemon water is not quite enough. Very old or extremely baked-on stains may need extra attention. Do not worry. Lemons can still help. You just need to combine their power with a little extra scrubbing action.

For tough spots, create a simple paste. Mix a small amount of baking soda with lemon juice. Add just enough lemon juice to form a thick paste. This mixture combines the abrasive power of baking soda with the acid of lemons. Apply this paste directly onto the stubborn stains. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. The baking soda helps to lift the grime. The lemon juice works to break it down.

After letting the paste sit, use a non-scratch scrubbing pad or brush. Gently scrub the treated areas. You will notice the grime starts to loosen. For the oven door glass, this paste works wonders. Baked-on grease often collects on the glass. Applying the lemon-baking soda paste to the [inside oven glass](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-inside-oven-glass) makes it clear again.

This allows for full steam circulation.
