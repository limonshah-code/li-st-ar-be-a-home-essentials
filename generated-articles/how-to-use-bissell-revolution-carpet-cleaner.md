Using your Bissell Revolution Carpet Cleaner involves a few simple steps. First, prepare your area by vacuuming. Next, mix the cleaning solution as directed. Fill the clean water tank. Then, make slow passes over your carpet. Finally, empty the dirty water and clean the machine for future use.

## Getting Started: Unboxing and Assembling Your Bissell Revolution

Unpacking a new appliance is always exciting. Your Bissell Revolution carpet cleaner arrives in a box. It has several parts inside. Do not worry; assembly is straightforward. I found the instructions clear and easy to follow. You will have your machine ready in minutes.

First, take all components out of the box. Place them on a flat, clean surface. Check the packing list. Ensure you have everything. You should see the main body, handles, and tanks. This initial check prevents any frustration later. All parts connect simply.

### What's in the Box?

Your Bissell Revolution package contains key components. You will find the main unit. This is the base of the cleaner. It holds the motor and brushes. There is also an upper handle. This connects to the main unit. You will also find a clean water tank and a dirty water tank. These tanks are easy to identify. The clean tank is for water and formula. The dirty tank collects the extracted grime. You might also find a hose and tools for spot cleaning or upholstery.

The machine often includes a trial-size cleaning formula. This lets you start cleaning right away. Make sure to keep the user manual handy. It contains important safety information and specific model details. Understanding each part's function makes assembly simple.

### Simple Assembly Steps

Assembling your Bissell Revolution is quick. First, slide the upper handle onto the main body. You will hear a click. This indicates a secure connection. Some models might use a screw for extra stability. If so, tighten it with a screwdriver. Next, fit the clean water tank into its designated spot. It usually clicks into place. Do the same for the dirty water tank. Ensure both tanks are empty before starting.

Finally, check all connections. Make sure everything feels secure. The machine should stand upright. It should not wobble. Now your Bissell Revolution is assembled. It is ready for its first use. This preparation takes only a few minutes. Getting the machine ready properly ensures smooth operation.

## Preparing Your Carpet for a Deep Clean

Before deep cleaning, your carpet needs preparation. This step ensures the best results. It makes the cleaning process more efficient. I always spend a little extra time here. This effort pays off with cleaner carpets. Proper preparation prevents spreading existing dirt.

Ignoring this step can lead to disappointing results. Loose debris might clog the cleaner. Or, embedded dirt might not lift effectively. A quick preparation makes a big difference. It helps your Bissell Revolution work its magic fully. Your carpets will thank you.

### Pre-Vacuuming for Best Results

Vacuuming is the first and most crucial step. Use a regular dry vacuum cleaner. Go over the entire carpeted area. Remove all loose dirt, dust, pet hair, and crumbs. These small particles can clog your Bissell Revolution. They can also mix with the cleaning solution. This might create muddy residue.

A thorough vacuuming lifts surface debris. This allows the carpet cleaner to focus on embedded dirt. It ensures the cleaning solution penetrates deeper. This leads to a more effective clean. Pay extra attention to high-traffic areas. These spots collect the most dry soil. Make multiple passes if needed. My vacuum often picks up more than I expect.

### Targeting Tough Stains

Some stains need special attention. Your Bissell Revolution is powerful. However, pre-treating tough spots helps. This gives the cleaner a head start. It prevents setting stains permanently. I always check for problem areas.

Use a suitable pre-treatment solution. Bissell offers specific spot removers. Apply the solution directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes. This allows it to break down the stain. Do not scrub too hard. Gently blot the area. Test the pre-treatment on an inconspicuous area first. This checks for colorfastness. This step ensures an even clean. It tackles the most stubborn marks. Move furniture out of the way as well. This allows you to clean the entire carpet.

## Mixing and Filling the Cleaning Solutions

Getting the right cleaning solution mixture is key. Your Bissell Revolution uses specific formulas. These solutions are designed to work with the machine. Using the wrong products can harm your cleaner. It can also leave residue on your carpets. Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines.

I found that precise mixing makes a big difference. It ensures optimal cleaning performance. It also protects your investment. This section covers choosing the right formula and proper mixing.

### Choosing the Right Bissell Formula

Bissell offers a range of cleaning formulas. Each is designed for specific needs. There are formulas for pet stains. Some focus on deep cleaning. Others tackle odors. Consider your carpet's needs. Do you have pets? Are you dealing with old, set-in stains? Or do you just need a general refresh?

Using genuine Bissell formulas is important. They are engineered for your Bissell Revolution. This ensures proper sudsing and effective cleaning. It also prevents damage to your machine. For instance, some formulas have Odor Eliminator. Others are for everyday use. Always read the bottle label carefully. It tells you what the formula does.

### Accurate Mixing Ratios

Your Bissell Revolution has a clean water tank. This tank often has measurement lines. These lines guide you in mixing. They show levels for water and cleaning formula. Follow these lines precisely. Do not overfill the formula. Too much solution can leave sticky residue. Too little might not clean effectively.

Some formulas are concentrated. They require less product per tank. Others are pre-mixed. Read the specific instructions on your formula bottle. Typically, you fill the tank with hot tap water first. Then, add the cleaning formula up to the indicated line. Close the tank lid securely. Ensure there are no leaks. A properly mixed solution ensures the best clean. It also prevents excessive foam.

## Operating Your Bissell Revolution for Optimal Cleaning

Now your Bissell Revolution is ready to go. The fun part begins. Operating the machine correctly ensures a deep clean. It also protects your carpets. I learned that slow, steady movements yield the best results. Rushing through the process can leave areas untouched.

This section will guide you through the cleaning modes. We will cover effective cleaning passes. You will learn to maximize your machine's power. This will give you truly spotless carpets.

### Understanding Cleaning Modes

Your Bissell Revolution often has different cleaning modes. Common modes include Deep Clean and Express Clean. Deep Clean mode uses more water and solution. It also provides more powerful suction. This mode is best for heavily soiled carpets. It tackles old stains and ground-in dirt. Deep Clean takes longer to dry.

Express Clean mode uses less water and solution. It is faster. It allows carpets to dry quicker. This mode is ideal for lighter cleaning. Use it for routine maintenance. It refreshes carpets between deep cleans. Choose the mode that fits your carpet's condition. The machine typically has a dial or button to switch modes. Selecting the right mode optimizes cleaning efficiency. Understanding these modes helps you achieve the best clean. This applies to various carpet cleaning machines, including how to operate a [Bissell carpet shampooer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-you-use-a-bissell-carpet-shampooer).

### Effective Cleaning Passes

Start cleaning at one end of the room. Work your way backward. This prevents walking on wet, clean carpet. Press the spray trigger when pushing forward. This applies the cleaning solution. Release the trigger when pulling backward. This allows the machine to suction up the dirty water. Make slow, overlapping passes. This ensures complete coverage. Overlap each pass by a few inches. This prevents streaks and missed spots.

For very dirty areas, you might need extra passes. Some users prefer a "dry pass" at the end. This means making a pass without spraying solution. It only uses suction. This helps extract more water. It speeds up drying time. Be patient and methodical. This technique delivers professional-level clean results. It ensures your carpet cleaner, much like a [carpet cleaner vacuum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-a-carpet-cleaner-vacuum), effectively lifts dirt and grime.

## Emptying Dirty Water and Post-Cleaning Care

The cleaning process is not over when the carpet looks clean. Emptying the dirty water is critical. It also requires proper post-cleaning care. This ensures your carpets dry correctly. It prevents mildew and odors. I always make sure to handle this step promptly.

Dirty water tanks fill up quickly. They show you just how much grime your carpets held. This step is essential for hygiene. It also keeps your home smelling fresh. Good post-cleaning care protects your carpet.

### Safe Disposal of Dirty Water

Your Bissell Revolution collects dirty water in a separate tank. This tank needs regular emptying. Do not let it overfill. An overfilled tank can lead to leaks. It can also reduce suction power. The dirty water tank is usually easy to remove. Just unlatch it from the machine. Carry it to a sink or toilet. Pour out the dirty water. You will be amazed at the color of the water. This shows the cleaner's effectiveness.

Rinse the dirty water tank thoroughly after emptying. Use clean water. This prevents residue buildup and odors. A clean tank is ready for the next use. This ensures maximum suction power. It also maintains hygiene. Never reuse dirty water for cleaning. Always use fresh, clean water and solution.

### Ensuring Proper Drying

Drying time is crucial after cleaning. Damp carpets can develop mildew. They can also attract new dirt faster. Aim for complete dryness within 6-12 hours. Several factors affect drying time. These include humidity, carpet thickness, and ventilation. Open windows or doors. This increases air circulation. You can also use fans. Point them directly at the cleaned areas.

Avoid walking on damp carpets. This can re-soil them. It also flattens the carpet fibers. For heavily soiled areas, you might have used more water. These spots will take longer to dry. Plan your cleaning schedule. Allow ample time for drying. Proper drying protects your carpets. It keeps them fresh and healthy.

## Cleaning and Maintaining Your Bissell Revolution

After deep cleaning your carpets, your Bissell Revolution needs attention. Cleaning the machine itself is vital. It extends the life of your cleaner. It also ensures optimal performance for future uses. I have found that a little post-use care goes a long way. Neglecting maintenance can lead to clogs and reduced efficiency.

This section covers essential steps. You will learn to clean and store your machine properly. This keeps it in top condition. It also prevents unpleasant odors. A well-maintained cleaner is always ready.

### Thorough Machine Cleaning

Cleaning your Bissell Revolution is simple. First, empty and rinse both water tanks. As mentioned, clean the dirty water tank thoroughly. Also, rinse the clean water tank. Next, remove the nozzle and brush roll cover. These parts collect hair and debris. Rinse them under running water. Use a soft brush if needed. Remove any tangled hair from the brush roll. This is important for brush performance.

Some models have removable filters. Check your manual for filter cleaning instructions. Rinse any screens or filters. Ensure all parts are free of residue. Allow all removable parts to air dry completely. Do not reassemble them while wet. This prevents mold and mildew growth. Regular cleaning keeps your machine running smoothly. This applies whether you have the standard Revolution or a model like the [Bissell Revolution Pet Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bissell-revolution-pet-pro).

### Smart Storage Practices

Proper storage prevents damage. It keeps your Bissell Revolution in good working order. Once all parts are dry, reassemble the machine. Store it in a cool, dry place. A closet or utility room works well. Avoid areas with extreme temperatures. Do not store it in direct sunlight. This can damage plastic components.

Ensure the power cord is neatly wrapped. Do not wrap it too tightly. This prevents kinks or damage. Store any attachments or tools with the main unit. This way, everything is together for the next cleaning session. Proper storage protects your investment. It ensures your Bissell Revolution is ready whenever you need it.

## Troubleshooting Common Bissell Revolution Issues

Even the best machines can have small issues. Your Bissell Revolution is reliable. However, you might encounter minor problems. Knowing how to troubleshoot saves time. It prevents unnecessary frustration. I often find simple solutions to common issues. Most problems are easy to fix yourself.

This section addresses frequently asked questions. It offers quick fixes for common setbacks. These tips help you get back to cleaning quickly. You will learn to identify and solve simple problems.

### No Suction? Check These First

A lack of suction is a common issue. It usually has a simple cause. First, check the dirty water tank. Is it full? An overfilled tank prevents proper suction. Empty and rinse it if needed. Second, check the tank lid. Is it properly sealed? A loose lid breaks the vacuum seal. This reduces suction power. Press it down firmly.

Next, inspect the nozzle and recovery tank opening. Are they clogged with debris? Hair, dirt, or dried solution can block suction. Clean these areas thoroughly. Finally, ensure the dirty water tank is seated correctly. It needs to form a tight seal with the machine base. If suction problems persist, consult your user manual. It has specific troubleshooting steps for your model. While this is for Revolution, some general repair knowledge from [how do I repair my Bissell 9400 carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-i-repair-my-bissell-9400-carpet-cleaner) might offer broader insights into machine functionality.

### Dealing with Leaks

Leaks can be frustrating. They usually point to a simple issue. First, check both water tanks. Are they properly seated? The clean water tank especially needs a tight fit. A loose tank seal can cause drips. Next, inspect the tank caps. Are they screwed on tightly? A loose cap can allow water to escape.

Check the rubber gaskets or O-rings on the tanks. Are they clean and intact? Damaged or dirty gaskets can prevent a proper seal. Clean them if they are dirty. If damaged, you might need replacement parts. Sometimes, a tiny crack in a tank can cause a leak. Examine the tanks carefully for visible damage. Small leaks are often easy to identify and fix. Persistent leaks might require professional service.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What's the difference between Deep Clean and Express Clean modes?

Several reasons can cause this. First, check if the clean water tank is full. Ensure it is properly seated and sealed. The spray trigger might not be pressed firmly.
