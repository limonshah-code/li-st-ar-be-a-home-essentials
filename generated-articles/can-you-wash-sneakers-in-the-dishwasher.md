## Cleaning Sneakers in the Dishwasher: A Practical Guide

Dirty sneakers are a common problem. We all want our favorite shoes to look new again. Many people wonder about the easiest way to clean them. Often, the idea of using a dishwasher comes up. This is because dishwashers offer speed and power for cleaning kitchen items.

However, asking "Can you wash sneakers in the dishwasher?" brings up important questions. Dishwashers use hot water, strong detergents, and powerful jets. These elements might harm your shoes. We will explore the risks involved. We will also cover safer and more effective cleaning methods. This guide helps you make the best choice for your footwear.

### Takeaway

*   Washing sneakers in a dishwasher can cause irreversible damage to materials and structure.
*   Dishwasher detergents are too harsh for shoe fabrics and glues.
*   High heat from a dishwasher can warp soles and melt adhesives.
*   Handwashing or a gentle machine wash cycle are safer alternatives.
*   Always air dry sneakers completely to avoid damage and odors.

### Clear, Concise Answer

No, washing sneakers in the dishwasher is generally not recommended. High heat settings, harsh detergents, and strong water jets can damage shoe materials, loosen glues, and warp the shape of your footwear. These actions can shorten the lifespan of your sneakers and potentially ruin them.

## The Risks of Washing Sneakers in Your Dishwasher

Using a dishwasher to clean sneakers poses many risks. Dishwashers are for dishes, not fabric and rubber. Their cleaning methods are too aggressive for most footwear. This can lead to permanent damage to your shoes.

### High Heat Damage

Dishwashers use very hot water during their cycles. Many also have a heated drying option. This high heat is bad for sneakers. It can melt the glues that hold shoes together. Soles might warp or shrink. Synthetic materials in shoes can also deform. This makes your shoes uncomfortable and unwearable.

### Harsh Detergents

Dishwasher detergents are strong chemicals. They remove tough food stains from plates and glasses. These detergents are too abrasive for shoe materials. They can strip colors from fabric. They might also degrade the rubber and foam. This makes shoes look faded or break down faster. You risk damaging the shoe's appearance and structure.

### Strong Water Pressure

Dishwashers spray water with high force. This pressure can be too much for sneakers. It can loosen stitching on your shoes. It might even tear delicate mesh or fabric parts. The forceful jets can also push components out of place. This changes the shoe's original shape. A long cycle under such pressure can easily ruin your sneakers. A standard dishwasher cycle can run for quite some time, meaning prolonged exposure to these harsh conditions.

### Sanitation Concerns

Washing shoes in your dishwasher raises hygiene issues. Your shoes carry dirt, germs, and outdoor debris. Washing them where you clean your eating utensils is not sanitary. Shoe particles can remain in the dishwasher. These particles might then transfer to your dishes during the next wash cycle. This creates a health risk. You also do not want harsh shoe chemicals on your plates.

## What Types of Sneakers Might (Theoretically) Survive Dishwasher Cleaning?

While I advise against using a dishwasher for sneakers, some types might, in theory, withstand it better. This applies to a very limited range of shoes. Even with these, risks of damage remain high. It is always safer to choose other cleaning methods.

### Simple Canvas Shoes

Basic canvas sneakers might have a slightly better chance. These shoes often lack complex parts. They use thick fabric and rubber soles. Canvas is a sturdy material. It might resist some heat and water better than other fabrics. Still, the glues holding canvas shoes together are vulnerable. Harsh detergents can still strip color from the canvas.

### All-Rubber or PVC Shoes

Some shoes are made entirely from rubber or PVC. Think of garden clogs or rain boots. These materials are non-porous and water-resistant. They do not absorb water or dirt easily. Such shoes are less likely to soak up harsh detergents. They are also more resistant to water pressure. However, high heat can still warp these materials. The shape of the shoe could change permanently.

### Avoiding Delicate Materials

You must never put shoes with delicate materials in a dishwasher. This includes leather, suede, and nubuck. These materials will dry out, crack, and become stiff. Shoes with embellishments like beads or sequins will also suffer. The dishwasher can tear them off. Shoes with advanced cushioning or gel inserts are also at risk. These parts can degrade in high heat. Performance shoes, like running shoes, often have many layers and special glues. They are very sensitive to improper cleaning.

Even for simpler shoes, the dishwasher is not a gentle environment. The combination of heat, strong chemicals, and water jets is powerful. It targets tough food residues, not delicate footwear. Choosing a dishwasher for any sneaker risks damaging your investment. It is better to use methods designed for shoes.

## Preparing Your Sneakers for Any Washing Method

Proper preparation is crucial before you clean your sneakers. This step improves cleaning results. It also helps protect your shoes, no matter how you choose to wash them. Skipping this part can make cleaning less effective. It can also cause more damage.

### Remove Laces and Insoles

Start by taking out the laces from your sneakers. Remove the insoles as well. Laces can tangle during washing. They might also prevent water and soap from reaching all parts of the shoe. Insoles absorb a lot of foot odor and moisture. They often need separate cleaning. This allows for thorough cleaning of both the inside and outside of the shoe. You can wash laces by hand or put them in a mesh bag with your shoes. Insoles are best cleaned by hand with mild soap and water.

### Brush Off Loose Dirt and Mud

Next, remove any large chunks of dirt or mud. Use a soft brush, an old toothbrush, or even a dry cloth. Gently brush the entire outer surface of the shoe. Pay extra attention to the soles and edges. Removing loose debris prevents it from spreading during washing. It also makes the main cleaning process easier. This step protects your washing appliance from excessive dirt.

### Spot Clean Heavy Stains

Look for any tough stains on your sneakers. Grass stains, scuff marks, or grease spots need special attention. Use a mild stain remover or a mixture of baking soda and water. Apply it directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, gently scrub the area with a soft brush or cloth. Pre-treating stains helps lift them more effectively during the wash. This improves the overall cleanliness of your shoes. This preparation is a good start, even if you insist on a risky method like dishwasher cleaning.

## Step-by-Step (Risky) Guide to Dishwasher Sneaker Cleaning (If You Must)

If you still decide to use a dishwasher, you must proceed with extreme caution. This method is not recommended. It carries high risks. Follow these steps to minimize potential damage. Understand that success is not guaranteed.

### Placement in the Dishwasher

First, clear out your dishwasher. You do not want food particles on your shoes. Place your sneakers on the top rack only. Lay them flat or stand them up. Make sure they are secure. You can use clips or a mesh laundry bag to hold them in place. This prevents them from moving around. Movement can cause damage to the shoes or the dishwasher itself. Do not put them on the bottom rack. The water jets are stronger there.

### Use Mild Detergent

Do not use regular dishwasher detergent. It is too harsh. Instead, use a very small amount of mild liquid dish soap. You can put a tiny squirt in the detergent dispenser. Alternatively, apply a little to a cloth and wipe it on the shoe surface. Choose a soap free of bleach or strong chemicals. Less is more in this case.

### Cold Water Setting, No Heat Dry

Select the cold water cycle on your dishwasher. Choose the shortest cycle available. It is very important to turn off the heated dry option. High heat is the biggest enemy of sneaker glues and materials. The heated dry will cause warping and melting. A dishwasher cycle, even a short, cold one, can still take a significant amount of time. Understanding [how long should a dishwasher take to wash](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-should-a-dishwasher-take-to-wash) can help manage your expectations for this risky process.

### Immediately Remove and Air Dry

As soon as the wash cycle finishes, remove your sneakers. Do not let them sit in the damp dishwasher. Excess moisture encourages mildew and odors. Immediately prepare them for drying. Air drying is the only safe method. Stuff your shoes with clean paper towels or newspaper. This helps absorb moisture and keeps their shape. Place them in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight or heat sources. Drying can take 24-48 hours. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them.

## Safer Alternatives for Washing Your Sneakers

Given the risks, safer alternatives exist for washing sneakers. These methods protect your shoes better. They also offer more control over the cleaning process. You can extend the life of your footwear with these approaches.

### Handwashing for Best Results

Handwashing is the gentlest and most effective method. It gives you direct control over cleaning. You can focus on dirty areas without damaging the entire shoe. This method works well for all types of sneakers, including delicate ones.

#### Gather Your Materials

You will need a few simple items. Grab a soft brush, like an old toothbrush. A clean cloth or sponge is also useful. You need a small bowl of warm water. Use a mild soap, like liquid dish soap or laundry detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals.

#### The Handwashing Process

First, brush off all loose dirt from your shoes. Remove laces and insoles. Dip your brush into the soapy water. Gently scrub the exterior of your sneakers. Work in small sections. Pay attention to stained areas. Use the cloth to wipe away excess soap and dirt. Rinse your brush often. Finish by wiping the entire shoe with a clean, damp cloth. Make sure to remove all soap residue.

### Washing Machine for Convenience

A washing machine offers a convenient option for many sneakers. This method is less labor-intensive than handwashing. However, you must follow specific steps to prevent damage. Not all shoes are suitable for machine washing.

#### Preparing for Machine Wash

Remove laces and insoles from your sneakers. Place the shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. This protects them from harsh tumbling. It also prevents them from hitting the drum. You can also add a few old towels to the wash. The towels help balance the load. They also cushion the shoes. This reduces impact during the cycle.

#### Machine Settings and Detergent

Use a small amount of mild laundry detergent. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. Select a cold water wash cycle. Choose the "delicate" or "gentle" setting. These settings use less agitation. They also help prevent color fading. Never use a hot water cycle. Hot water can damage glues and materials. A typical delicate wash cycle can still take a reasonable amount of time. Knowing [how long should a dishwasher take to wash](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-should-a-dishwasher-take-to-wash) helps illustrate that even gentle machine washing requires a time commitment, similar to understanding appliance cycles.

#### After the Wash

Once the cycle finishes, take your shoes out immediately. Do not put them in the dryer. Always air dry your sneakers. Proceed to the proper drying techniques section for best results. This ensures your shoes dry safely and maintain their shape.

## Proper Drying Techniques After Washing Sneakers

Proper drying is as important as proper washing. Incorrect drying can ruin your sneakers. It can cause them to shrink, warp, or develop odors. Always use gentle methods to preserve your shoes.

### Air Drying is Essential

Never use a dryer for your sneakers. The high heat from a dryer will melt glues. It can also warp plastic components and shrink fabrics. This will permanently alter the shape and fit of your shoes. Always opt for air drying. Air drying allows the shoes to dry naturally. This protects their structure and materials.

### Stuff with Newspaper or Paper Towels

After washing, remove any excess water. Then, stuff the inside of your sneakers with clean newspaper or paper towels. This serves two purposes. First, the paper absorbs moisture from the inside of the shoe. This speeds up the drying process. Second, the paper helps maintain the shoe's original shape. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp. Continue this until the shoes feel mostly dry.

### Keep Away from Direct Heat or Sunlight

Place your stuffed sneakers in a well-ventilated area. A spot indoors with good airflow is ideal. Avoid placing them in direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can fade colors and degrade materials. Also, keep them away from direct heat sources. This includes radiators, space heaters, or hair dryers. These heat sources can still cause warping and damage. Air circulation is key for even drying.

### Allow Sufficient Time

Drying sneakers takes time. It can take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours. Sometimes even longer, depending on the shoe material and humidity. Do not rush the process. Wearing shoes that are still damp can lead to unpleasant odors. It can also encourage mildew growth. Ensure your sneakers are completely dry inside and out before you wear them again. Patience in drying helps keep your shoes fresh and in good condition.

## Maintaining Clean Sneakers Between Washes

Keeping your sneakers clean does not just involve washing them. Regular maintenance between washes extends their life. It also keeps them looking fresh for longer. Small, consistent efforts make a big difference.

### Regular Wiping and Brushing

Make it a habit to wipe down your sneakers after each wear. Use a damp cloth to remove surface dirt. For fabric or mesh shoes, a soft brush can remove dust and loose debris. This prevents dirt from setting into the material. It also reduces the need for frequent deep cleaning. This simple step takes only a minute or two.

### Use Shoe Protectors and Sprays

Consider using a shoe protector spray. These sprays create a barrier on the shoe surface. This barrier repels water and stains. It makes your shoes more resistant to spills and dirt. Apply the spray to new or freshly cleaned shoes. Always follow the product instructions for best results. This layer of protection keeps your shoes cleaner longer.

### Proper Storage

How you store your sneakers matters. Always store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or humid environments. Humidity can promote mildew growth. Sunlight can fade colors. Keep them in their original box or a shoe rack. Using shoe trees can help maintain their shape. Proper storage keeps your shoes in good condition. It also prevents dust accumulation.

### Spot Cleaning as Needed

Address small stains as soon as they happen. Do not wait for a full wash. A quick spot clean prevents stains from setting in. Use a mild cleaner and a clean cloth. Gently dab and wipe the affected area. This proactive approach keeps your sneakers looking their best. It reduces the need for more intensive cleaning methods.

## FAQ Section

### Can I put all types of shoes in the dishwasher?

No, you should not put all types of shoes in the dishwasher. Delicate materials like leather, suede, and embroidered shoes will be ruined by high heat and strong detergents. Athletic shoes with complex sole constructions can also suffer irreparable damage. Only very basic canvas or all-rubber shoes might withstand a cold cycle, but even then, risks are high.
