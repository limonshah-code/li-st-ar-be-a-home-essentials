## How to Clean Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter for Spotless Dishes

Have you noticed your dishes are not coming out as clean as they used to? Perhaps there is a lingering odor from your dishwasher. A dirty filter often causes these issues. Learning how to clean the filter on a Whirlpool dishwasher is a simple maintenance task. This process restores your appliance's performance and ensures sparkling results every time.

I understand the frustration of pulling out spotty dishes after a wash cycle. This article helps you solve that problem. We will cover identifying your filter, gathering tools, and step-by-step cleaning. You will also learn about reinstallation and maintenance frequency. Let us get your Whirlpool dishwasher working at its best.

### Takeaway

Cleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher filter regularly improves cleaning performance.
*   Locate the filter at the bottom of the tub.
*   Twist and lift to remove filter components.
*   Rinse under warm water, scrub gently with a soft brush and mild soap.
*   Reinstall parts securely.
*   Clean the filter at least once a month, or more often with heavy use.

To clean the filter on a Whirlpool dishwasher, you must first locate it at the bottom of the tub. Twist it counter-clockwise to unlock. Remove the two-part filter assembly. Rinse the parts under warm running water, using a soft brush and mild dish soap to remove food particles and debris. Reassemble and twist clockwise to secure it back in place.

## Understanding Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter's Job

Your Whirlpool dishwasher filter plays a crucial role in cleaning dishes. It traps food particles and debris during wash cycles. This prevents these particles from recirculating onto your dishes. A clean filter ensures water sprays effectively and dishes come out spotless.

Without a functioning filter, debris could clog the spray arms. This leads to inefficient cleaning and potential damage to the pump. The filter keeps your dishwasher's internal components clean. It extends the life of your appliance. A clear filter also prevents odors from developing. Odors often come from trapped food particles. A dirty filter compromises your dishwasher's ability to clean dishes. Learn more about [what does dishwasher filter do](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-does-dishwasher-filter-do).

Some Whirlpool models feature a self-cleaning filter system. These systems typically grind down food particles. They then flush them away with the wash water. Other models have a manual filter that requires regular cleaning. Most modern Whirlpool dishwashers use a manual filter that you need to clean. Understanding your model's filter type helps with proper maintenance. Regular inspection is key for both types of systems. You want to make sure your [Whirlpool dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-whirlpool-dishwasher) performs its best.

## Finding Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter

Locating the filter in your Whirlpool dishwasher is usually straightforward. The filter assembly sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is typically near the center or slightly to one side. You will need to remove the lower dish rack to access it easily.

Once the lower rack is out, look for a cylindrical or flat screen component. This component usually has a handle or an arrow indicating the unlock direction. Most Whirlpool dishwashers have a two-part filter system. This system includes an upper filter assembly and a lower filter screen. The upper filter is often a cylinder. The lower filter is a flat plate underneath.

If you have trouble finding it, consult your dishwasher's owner's manual. The manual provides specific diagrams and instructions for your model. Different Whirlpool models may have slight variations in filter design. Knowing your model helps locate the filter.

## Essential Tools and Supplies for Filter Cleaning

Gathering the right tools makes cleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher filter easy. You likely have most items already. You will need a few basic cleaning supplies. These items help you effectively remove grime and food residue.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Dish Soap:** Use a mild liquid dish soap. It helps break down grease and food particles. Avoid abrasive cleaners.
*   **Soft Brush or Old Toothbrush:** This is essential for scrubbing the mesh screens. It gets into small crevices without causing damage.
*   **Warm Water:** Running water is necessary for rinsing the filter parts. A faucet with good pressure helps.
*   **Paper Towels or Microfiber Cloth:** Use these for drying the filter components. They also help wipe down the filter housing.
*   **Gloves (Optional):** You might want to wear rubber gloves. This keeps your hands clean, especially when dealing with food debris.

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing pads. These can damage the delicate mesh of the filter. They could also leave residues that affect future wash cycles. Simple tools ensure thorough cleaning without harming your appliance. Prepare these items before you start the cleaning process.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Removing and Cleaning Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter

Cleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher filter is a straightforward process. Follow these steps carefully to ensure thorough cleaning. This helps your dishwasher perform optimally. I find this task surprisingly simple to complete.

### Step 1: Disconnect Power

Always begin by unplugging your dishwasher from the power outlet. You can also turn off the circuit breaker that controls the dishwasher. This step is critical for safety. It prevents accidental starting during the cleaning process. Safety first is my motto for any appliance work.

### Step 2: Clear the Lower Dish Rack

Pull out the lower dish rack completely. You may need to remove it from the tracks. This gives you full access to the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You need space to maneuver and reach the filter assembly.

### Step 3: Remove the Upper Filter Assembly

Look for the cylindrical or round filter at the bottom. Most Whirlpool filters have an arrow or a "lock/unlock" indicator. Turn the upper filter assembly counter-clockwise. You will hear a click as it unlocks. Lift it straight up to remove it from the dishwasher. This component often collects larger food pieces.

### Step 4: Remove the Lower Filter Screen

Once the upper filter is out, you will see a flat filter screen underneath. This lower filter is usually a fine mesh. Carefully lift it out of its recess. Some models may require a gentle tug. This part traps smaller particles. This step is crucial for thorough cleaning. If you need more specific guidance, see [how to remove and clean Whirlpool dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-and-clean-whirlpool-dishwasher-filter). For general removal tips, [how to remove dishwasher filter on Whirlpool](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-dishwasher-filter-on-whirlpool) can also help.

### Step 5: Clean Both Filter Parts

Take both filter parts to a sink. Rinse them thoroughly under warm running water. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush with a few drops of mild dish soap. Gently scrub away all trapped food particles and grease. Pay close attention to the mesh screens. Food debris can become stuck in the tiny holes. Make sure no residue remains. The goal is for water to flow freely through the mesh. You want them to look almost new. Getting all the gunk out is satisfying.

For general filter cleaning, check out [how to clean filter in dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-in-dishwasher).

### Step 6: Inspect and Dry

Once clean, inspect both filter parts. Look for any remaining debris or damage. If the mesh is torn or heavily corroded, consider replacing the filter. Dry the filter components with a paper towel or let them air dry completely. Ensuring they are dry helps prevent moisture-related issues.

## Reinstalling Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter Correctly

Putting the filter back into your Whirlpool dishwasher correctly is as important as cleaning it. Proper reinstallation ensures the filter functions effectively. It also prevents leaks or damage to the appliance. I always double-check these steps for peace of mind.

### Step 1: Place the Lower Filter Screen

First, carefully place the flat lower filter screen back into its recess at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Ensure it sits flat and snugly. It should align with the grooves or guides in the tub. This part forms the base for the upper filter.

### Step 2: Insert the Upper Filter Assembly

Next, align the upper cylindrical filter assembly with the lower filter screen. There are usually notches or tabs that must line up. Gently push the upper filter down. Twist it clockwise until it locks into place. You should feel a click or a firm stop. This indicates it is properly seated and locked. Make sure it does not wobble. A secure fit is important. You can find specific instructions on [how to put Whirlpool dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-whirlpool-dishwasher-filter-back-in). For general guidance, [how to put dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in) is also helpful.

### Step 3: Replace the Lower Dish Rack

Slide the lower dish rack back into its tracks. Ensure it glides smoothly. Test it by pulling it out and pushing it in a few times. This confirms the filter is not obstructing its movement. A freely moving rack means the filter is correctly installed.

### Step 4: Restore Power

Finally, plug the dishwasher back into the power outlet. Alternatively, flip the circuit breaker back on. Your Whirlpool dishwasher is now ready for use. Run a quick rinse cycle or an empty wash cycle. This helps confirm everything is working correctly. It also flushes out any remaining soap residue from cleaning. A well-installed filter means your dishes will get clean again.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter?

Knowing the right frequency for cleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher filter is key to maintaining performance. The ideal cleaning schedule depends on your household's usage. It also depends on the types of food you wash off dishes. Regular cleaning prevents build-up. It keeps your dishwasher running efficiently.

For most households, I recommend cleaning the manual filter at least once a month. This is a good general guideline. However, if your family uses the dishwasher frequently, you might need to clean it more often. For example, if you run it daily or wash many dishes with heavy food scraps. In such cases, cleaning every two weeks could be beneficial.

Consider these factors when determining your cleaning schedule:

*   **Dishwasher Usage:** Daily use means more frequent cleaning. Less frequent use allows for longer intervals.
*   **Food Type:** If you often wash dishes with large food particles, like rice, pasta, or sticky sauces, clean the filter more often. These items are more likely to clog the mesh.
*   **Dish Rinsing Habits:** If you pre-rinse dishes thoroughly, your filter will collect less debris. If you scrape plates but do not rinse, the filter works harder.
*   **Performance Issues:** If you notice dishes are not clean, or there is an odor, it is time to clean the filter. This indicates a blockage.

Regular cleaning prevents unpleasant odors and ensures dishes come out sparkling. It also extends the life of your appliance. A routine helps avoid bigger problems down the line. For more detailed information, you can read about [how often should you clean your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-your-dishwasher-filter) and [how often should you clean the dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-the-dishwasher-filter).

## Troubleshooting Common Filter-Related Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter some issues. These problems often relate to the dishwasher filter. Knowing how to troubleshoot them can save you time and frustration. I have personally dealt with many of these.

### Problem: Dishes are Not Clean

This is the most common sign of a dirty or clogged filter. Food particles recirculate onto the dishes.

*   **Solution:** Thoroughly clean the filter as described earlier. Check for any stubborn bits of food caught in the mesh. Ensure the filter is correctly reinstalled and locked in place. Also, inspect the spray arms for any clogs. Sometimes, tiny food particles can pass through the filter and block spray arm holes.

### Problem: Unpleasant Odors from the Dishwasher

A foul smell often indicates trapped food particles rotting in the filter.

*   **Solution:** Remove and deep clean the filter immediately. Use warm, soapy water and a brush. For persistent odors, after cleaning the filter, run an empty wash cycle. Add a cup of white vinegar to the top rack or a dishwasher cleaning tablet. This helps neutralize odors and sanitize the tub.

### Problem: Water Not Draining Properly

While less common for filter issues, a severely clogged filter can hinder drainage.

*   **Solution:** Check the filter for excessive debris. Clean it thoroughly. If the problem persists, the issue might be with the drain hose or pump. Consult your appliance manual or a professional.

### Problem: Dishwasher Error Codes

Some Whirlpool models display error codes related to drainage or wash performance. These can sometimes point to a filter issue.

*   **Solution:** Consult your owner's manual for specific error code meanings. Many codes relate to water flow. A clogged filter restricts water flow. Cleaning the filter often resolves these codes. If the code persists, it might indicate a more serious problem. This could be with the water pump or drain system.

### Problem: Grinding Noises

Unusual noises, like grinding, can happen if large food particles get past the filter. They can then jam the pump impeller.

*   **Solution:** Inspect the filter for tears or damage. A damaged filter allows larger debris through. If you suspect something is lodged in the pump area, you may need professional help. Avoid running the dishwasher if you hear grinding noises. This prevents further damage.

Regular filter maintenance helps prevent most of these issues. A clean filter ensures smooth operation and sparkling dishes every time.

## Advanced Tips for Whirlpool Dishwasher Maintenance

Beyond cleaning the filter, other simple maintenance tasks keep your Whirlpool dishwasher in top condition. These tips enhance performance and extend the appliance's lifespan. I find that proactive care saves money and hassle in the long run.

### Clean the Spray Arms

Over time, mineral deposits or food particles can clog the holes in the spray arms. This reduces water pressure and impacts cleaning.

*   **How to:** Remove the upper and lower spray arms (they usually twist off). Use a toothpick or small wire to clear any clogged holes. Rinse them under warm water. Reattach them securely. This ensures water jets hit all parts of your dishes.

### Wipe Down the Door Seal

The rubber gasket around the dishwasher door can accumulate grime, food residue, and mold. This causes odors and can lead to leaks.

*   **How to:** Regularly wipe the door seal with a damp cloth and a mild cleaner. Pay attention to the creases where debris collects. For tough mold, use a solution of white vinegar and water. A clean seal prevents odors and keeps your kitchen fresh.

### Descale the Dishwasher Tub

Hard water leaves mineral deposits inside the dishwasher tub and on heating elements. This can affect cleaning efficiency and cause cloudy dishes.

*   **How to:** Place a cup of white vinegar in a dishwasher-safe bowl on the top rack. Run an empty hot water cycle. You can also use a specialized dishwasher cleaner. This helps dissolve mineral buildup. Perform this every few months, depending on your water hardness.

### Check for Drainage Issues

Ensure your dishwasher drains properly after each cycle. Standing water can lead to foul odors and mold growth.

*   **How to:** Regularly check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. Make sure your sink's air gap (if present) is clear. Proper drainage is vital for a hygienic dishwasher. If you notice persistent standing water, it might indicate a clog further down the line or a pump issue.

### Use High-Quality Dishwasher Detergent

Using good quality detergent helps prevent residue buildup and ensures effective cleaning. Avoid using too much detergent. This can create excessive suds and leave a film on dishes. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for detergent usage.

By incorporating these additional maintenance tasks into your routine, your Whirlpool dishwasher will continue to deliver excellent results. A well-maintained dishwasher is a happy dishwasher.

## FAQ Section

### Can I put my Whirlpool dishwasher filter in the dishwasher?

No, you should not put your Whirlpool dishwasher filter in the dishwasher itself. The dishwasher's intense water jets can damage the delicate mesh of the filter. It also may not effectively remove all the trapped food particles. Hand-washing the filter with warm water, mild soap, and a soft brush is the best method for thorough cleaning.

### What happens if I don't clean my Whirlpool dishwasher filter?

If you do not clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter, several problems can occur. Food particles and grease will build up, reducing water flow and leading to poor cleaning performance. Your dishes may come out spotty or with residue. Unpleasant odors can develop inside the dishwasher. Over time, a severely clogged filter can strain the pump and potentially lead to costly repairs.

### How do I know if my Whirlpool dishwasher filter needs cleaning?

You will notice several signs if your Whirlpool dishwasher filter needs cleaning. The most obvious is visible food debris and grime on the filter itself. Your dishes may not come out clean, often having food particles stuck to them. A lingering foul odor from the dishwasher is another strong indicator. You might also notice standing water at the bottom of the tub after a cycle.

### Is cleaning the Whirlpool dishwasher filter difficult?

### Do all Whirlpool dishwashers have a manual filter that needs cleaning?

Not all Whirlpool dishwashers have a manual filter that requires regular cleaning. Some older or specific models may feature a "self-cleaning" filter system. These systems typically grind down food particles during the wash cycle and flush them away. However, most modern Whirlpool dishwashers, especially those designed for quieter operation, use a manual filter that you need to clean periodically. Always check your owner's manual to confirm your model's filter type.

### What cleaning solutions should I use for my Whirlpool dishwasher filter?

For cleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher filter, use warm water and a mild liquid dish soap. A soft brush, like an old toothbrush, helps scrub away stubborn food particles without damaging the filter mesh. Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or stiff brushes. These can degrade the filter material or leave residues that may harm your dishwasher or dishes during future cycles.
