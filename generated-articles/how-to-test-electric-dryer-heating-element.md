Has your electric dryer stopped heating up? You might find your clothes are still damp after a full cycle. This is a common problem. Often, a faulty heating element is the cause. Knowing how to test an electric dryer heating element can save you time and money. You do not need to call a technician right away. I will show you how to check this vital component yourself. This guide provides clear steps to diagnose the problem. We will cover safety, tools, and the testing process. You can get your dryer working again with these simple instructions.

### Takeaway
*   Always disconnect power before working on an electric dryer.
*   Use a multimeter to perform a continuity test on the heating element.
*   A "no continuity" reading or infinite resistance indicates a bad heating element.
*   A good heating element shows a specific resistance reading, often between 8 and 15 ohms.
*   Replace the heating element if it fails the continuity test.

### What is the simplest way to check if an electric dryer heating element is bad?

The simplest way to check if an electric dryer heating element is bad is to perform a continuity test using a multimeter. You will disconnect the dryer from power, access the heating element, then touch the multimeter probes to the element's terminals. A reading of "OL" or infinite resistance means the element has no continuity and needs replacement.

## Understanding Your Electric Dryer's Heating System

Your electric dryer needs heat to dry clothes. This heat comes from the heating element. It is a coiled wire that glows red when electricity passes through it. The dryer's fan blows air over this hot coil. This creates warm air that dries your clothes. Without a working heating element, your dryer simply tumbles clothes in cool air.

Other parts work with the heating element. The thermostat controls the temperature. Thermal fuses protect the dryer from overheating. A cycling thermostat turns the element on and off. If any of these parts fail, the dryer may not heat. However, the heating element is a common failure point. Its continuous heating and cooling cycles wear it out. Understanding how these parts work together helps you troubleshoot.

When your dryer stops producing heat, the heating element is often the first suspect. It is a vital component. Its failure prevents your dryer from performing its main job. Before you replace any parts, you need to test the heating element. This ensures you fix the correct problem. This guide focuses on testing the heating element directly.

Knowing how the heating element gets power is helpful. Electricity flows to the element terminals. If the coil breaks inside, the circuit opens. Electricity cannot flow, and the element will not heat. A multimeter can detect this open circuit. This test confirms if the element is the issue.

## Safety First: Preparing for Electric Dryer Testing

Working with an electric dryer requires care. Electricity can cause serious injury or even death. Always prioritize your safety before starting any repair work. Do not skip any safety steps. Taking precautions protects you and your home.

First, unplug the dryer from the wall outlet. This cuts all power to the appliance. Do not just turn off the dryer at the control panel. The outlet must be completely disconnected. Ensure the power cord is fully out of the socket.

Next, turn off the circuit breaker for the dryer. Go to your home's main electrical panel. Find the breaker labeled for your laundry room or dryer. Flip it to the "off" position. This adds another layer of safety. It prevents accidental power surges during your work.

Wear appropriate safety gear. Work gloves protect your hands from sharp edges. Some dryer components can be dusty or have grime. Eye protection is also a good idea. Small parts can spring loose, or dust can irritate your eyes. Proper attire means no loose clothing or jewelry. These items can get caught in moving parts or electrical components.

Make sure your work area is dry and well-lit. Avoid working in damp basements or near water sources. Water conducts electricity, increasing risk. Good lighting helps you see small parts and connections clearly. A flashlight or headlamp can be useful if ambient light is low. Keeping the area clear helps prevent trips and falls.

Confirm the dryer has no power before touching anything inside. You can use a voltage tester on the outlet. Or, simply try to turn the dryer on after unplugging it. If it does not power up at all, you have successfully cut the power. This step is crucial. Do not begin dismantling the dryer until you are certain power is off.

## Essential Tools for Testing Your Dryer Element

You need a few simple tools for this job. These tools help you access and test the heating element safely. Having the right equipment makes the process smoother. You probably already own most of these items.

A **multimeter** is the most important tool. It measures electrical properties like voltage, current, and resistance. For testing the heating element, you will use its resistance or continuity setting. You can find multimeters at any hardware store. They are generally inexpensive and easy to use. Learn how to set your multimeter before starting.

You will need a **screwdriver set**. This usually includes Phillips head and flathead screwdrivers. Dryers have various types of screws holding panels in place. Some models might use nut drivers or Torx bits. Check your dryer's manual or visually inspect the screws. Have a range of sizes ready.

A **pair of work gloves** offers protection. Dryer interiors can have sharp metal edges. Gloves prevent cuts and scrapes. They also keep your hands clean from dust or lint. Choose gloves that allow for finger dexterity.

A **flashlight or headlamp** is very helpful. Dryer interiors are often dark. A good light source helps you see wiring and small components clearly. This reduces the chance of making a mistake. It also helps you locate the heating element quickly.

You might also need a **small container or magnetic tray**. This is useful for holding screws and small parts. It prevents them from getting lost. Losing a screw can delay the repair process. Keeping everything organized is key.

Make sure your tools are in good condition. A faulty multimeter can give wrong readings. Dull screwdrivers can strip screw heads. Take a moment to check your tools before you begin. Having the right tools ensures an accurate test and a safe repair.

## Accessing the Electric Dryer Heating Element

Before you can test the heating element, you must get to it. The location of the heating element varies by dryer brand and model. Most electric dryers house the heating element at the back or bottom. You will need to remove panels to reach it. This part requires a bit of disassembly.

For most electric dryers, you start by moving the dryer away from the wall. This gives you space to work. Make sure it is unplugged first. Then, you will usually remove the back panel. Many dryer models have a large access panel on the rear. Use your screwdriver to remove all screws holding this panel. Once the screws are out, gently pull the panel away. Set it aside in a safe place.

Some dryer models, especially older ones or certain brands like GE or Whirlpool, may have the heating element accessible from the lower front panel or from inside the drum. If your dryer has a removable toe kick panel at the bottom front, try removing that. This might reveal the heating element housing. For others, you might need to open the door and remove screws from the inside of the drum's front bulkhead. This allows the front panel to come off.

When you remove panels, note the location of each screw. You can draw a simple diagram or take pictures. This helps with reassembly. Be careful not to pull on wires. Wires are often attached to the panels. Disconnect any wires that prevent panel removal. Always note where they connect.

Once the panel is off, locate the heating element housing. It usually looks like a metal box or coil enclosure. Wires connect to its terminals. The element itself is often visible as a coil of wire within the housing. It sits near the blower wheel or exhaust duct. For specific instructions on various dryer models, you can refer to specialized guides. For example, learning [how to test a Whirlpool dryer heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-whirlpool-dryer-heating-element) might help if you own that brand, as access methods can differ slightly.

Identify the two terminals where wires attach to the heating element. These are the points you will test. Before testing, disconnect these wires. Remember which wire goes to which terminal. You may want to label them or take a photo. This step prepares the element for an accurate continuity test.

## Performing the Continuity Test with a Multimeter

Now comes the crucial step: testing the heating element. You will use your multimeter to perform a continuity test. This test checks if electricity can flow through the element's coil. If the coil is broken, it will show no continuity.

First, set your multimeter. Turn the dial to the "Ohms" (Î©) setting. This measures electrical resistance. Some multimeters have a specific "continuity" setting, often indicated by a sound wave or diode symbol. If your meter has a continuity setting, use it. When continuity is present, it will beep. If not, it will show a low resistance reading.

Identify the two terminals on the heating element. These are the points where the wires connected. Make sure you have disconnected both wires from the element terminals. The element must be isolated from the dryer's electrical system for an accurate test. Touching the probes to the connected wires will give you a false reading.

Touch one multimeter probe to one terminal of the heating element. Touch the other probe to the second terminal. Hold the probes steady. The multimeter display will show a reading. If you are using the continuity setting, listen for a beep. A beep indicates continuity, meaning the element is likely good.

If your multimeter is set to ohms, look at the numerical display. A good heating element will typically show a low resistance reading. This reading is usually between 8 and 15 ohms. The exact number can vary by dryer model. A reading in this range means the coil is intact and conducting electricity. This indicates the heating element is functioning correctly.

If the multimeter displays "OL" (Over Limit) or "1" (meaning infinite resistance), there is no continuity. This indicates an open circuit within the heating element. An open circuit means the coil is broken. Electricity cannot flow through it. This element is bad and needs replacement. If the meter does not beep on the continuity setting, it also means no continuity.

Sometimes, you might get a reading of "0" ohms. This means a direct short circuit. While less common for heating elements, it also indicates a problem. A healthy element should have some resistance, not zero. If you get an unusual reading, recheck your connections. Make sure the probes are firmly on the terminals. Test the probes themselves by touching them together. They should read close to zero.

After testing, if the heating element shows no continuity, it is time for a replacement. This test provides a clear answer. This process applies to many dryer components. For example, the process for [testing a Whirlpool dryer heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-whirlpool-dryer-heating-element) uses the same multimeter method. This makes troubleshooting consistent across brands.

## Interpreting Your Multimeter Readings

Understanding what your multimeter tells you is essential. The readings reveal the condition of your electric dryer heating element. It helps you decide if a replacement is needed. Paying attention to these numbers and symbols is important.

**Reading #1: Low Resistance (e.g., 8-15 Ohms)**
When your multimeter shows a low resistance reading, typically between 8 and 15 ohms, the heating element is good. This means the electrical path through the element's coil is complete. Electricity can flow through it, allowing it to heat up. This reading indicates the element is working as expected. If you get this reading, the heating element is not the problem. You will need to check other components.

**Reading #2: "OL" or "1" (Over Limit/Infinite Resistance)**
This reading is often displayed as "OL" (Over Limit) or a "1" on the far left of the display, with no other numbers. This indicates infinite resistance. It means there is no continuity. The electrical path through the heating element is broken. This happens when the heating coil inside breaks. The element cannot conduct electricity. An "OL" reading means the heating element is bad and needs to be replaced. This is a common finding for a non-heating dryer.

**Reading #3: Zero Ohms**
A reading of exactly zero ohms means there is a direct short circuit. While rare for a heating element, it is possible. This means the electricity bypasses the coil and flows directly through. This also makes the element ineffective. A zero ohm reading also indicates a faulty element that needs replacement. A good heating element must have some resistance.

**Reading #4: No Beep on Continuity Setting**
If your multimeter has a continuity setting and it does not beep, it confirms an open circuit. This is the same as the "OL" or "1" reading on the resistance setting. No beep means no continuity. The element is faulty.

**What to do if the element is good but the dryer still does not heat?**
If your heating element tests good, other components might be at fault. Common issues include a bad thermal fuse, a faulty cycling thermostat, or a broken high-limit thermostat. These parts also control the heat. You can often test them using the same continuity method. For instance, sometimes a dryer stops heating due to a tripped thermal fuse, and you might need to learn [how to reset an LG electric dryer not heating](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-lg-electric-dryer-not-heating) if you have that brand. This shows how different parts can cause similar symptoms.

Always double-check your multimeter settings and probe connections. A loose connection can give a false reading. Ensure your hands are not touching the metal part of the probes or terminals. Your body resistance can affect the reading. Proper interpretation ensures you replace the correct part.

## What to Do If the Element Fails the Test

If your electric dryer heating element fails the continuity test, it is broken. It cannot heat your clothes. The only solution is to replace it. Trying to repair a broken heating coil is not practical or safe. New heating elements are readily available.

First, identify your dryer's exact model number. This is usually on a sticker inside the dryer door or on the back panel. Different dryer models require specific heating elements. Using the wrong part can cause problems. Order the replacement element from a reliable appliance parts supplier. Many online retailers sell these parts.

Once you have the new heating element, disconnect power again. Double-check that the dryer is unplugged and the circuit breaker is off. Remove the back panel or access panel again, just as you did for testing. Carefully disconnect any wires from the old heating element. Note their positions if you did not before.

Next, remove the old heating element assembly. It is usually held in place by screws or clips. You might need to detach the exhaust duct or other surrounding components to free it. Some elements are part of a larger housing. Be gentle as you remove it. Avoid damaging nearby wires or sensors.

Install the new heating element. Place it into the housing exactly how the old one sat. Secure it with the screws or clips. Make sure it is firmly in place. Reconnect the wires to the element terminals. Ensure the connections are tight. Loose connections can cause arcing and future problems.

Before reassembling the entire dryer, do a quick visual check. Make sure all wires are connected properly. Ensure no tools are left inside the dryer. Replace any thermal fuses or thermostats if they also tested bad. This is a good time to clear out any lint from the heating element area. Excess lint is a fire hazard.

Finally, reattach all panels you removed. Secure them with their screws. Push the dryer back into its position. Plug the dryer back into the wall outlet. Turn the circuit breaker back on. Run a test cycle with a small load of damp clothes. Check if the dryer now produces heat. It should start heating within a few minutes. If it heats, you have successfully replaced the element.

Replacing a heating element is a common DIY repair. The process is similar to other appliance heating element replacements, such as [replacing an electric oven heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-electric-oven-heating-element). The basic principles of safety, access, testing, and replacement remain consistent. This repair can extend the life of your dryer and save you money compared to professional service.

## Preventative Maintenance for Your Electric Dryer

Regular maintenance helps your electric dryer last longer. It also prevents common problems, like a faulty heating element. A well-maintained dryer runs more efficiently. Simple steps can keep your appliance in top condition.

First, clean the lint screen after every load. This is the easiest and most important step. A clogged lint screen restricts airflow. Poor airflow makes the dryer work harder. It can cause the heating element to overheat and fail prematurely. It also creates a fire hazard. Make sure to remove all visible lint.

At least once a year, clean the dryer vent hose and the outside vent. Lint builds up in these areas over time. Use a vacuum cleaner with a long attachment to clear the vent hose. Disconnect the hose from the back of the dryer and from the wall. Clean the vent flap on the outside of your house. A clogged vent is a major cause of dryer inefficiency and potential overheating. This directly impacts the heating element's lifespan.

Inspect the dryer's interior and exterior periodically. Look for loose screws or damaged parts. Check the condition of the power cord. Ensure there are no kinks or fraying. If you notice any damage, address it promptly. Small issues can become bigger problems.

Consider professional cleaning or inspection every few years. A technician can clean parts you cannot easily reach. They can also inspect components like the blower wheel, thermal fuses, and thermostats. This proactive approach can catch problems before they cause a complete breakdown. It also helps maintain optimal drying performance.

Avoid overloading your dryer. Overloading restricts airflow and forces the dryer to run longer. This puts extra strain on the heating element and motor. Dry smaller loads to allow proper tumbling and airflow. This reduces wear and tear on all dryer components.

Use the correct drying cycles. Over-drying clothes wastes energy and can damage fabrics. It also subjects the heating element to unnecessary prolonged operation. Modern dryers have moisture sensors. These sensors can automatically stop the cycle when clothes are dry. Use these features to prevent excessive heat exposure.

By following these maintenance tips, you can extend the life of your electric dryer. You can also prevent the heating element from failing prematurely. Regular care keeps your dryer running smoothly. It saves you money on repairs and energy bills.
