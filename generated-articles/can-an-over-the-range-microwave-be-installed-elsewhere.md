OTR microwaves have a fan. This fan needs to vent air. You have three main options:
1.  **Ducted Outside:** Air moves through a duct to the home's exterior. This is the best method for removing cooking odors. If you move the microwave, you might need new ductwork. This can be complex.
2.  **Recirculating:** Air passes through a charcoal filter and returns to the kitchen. This does not remove humidity or heat. It is easier to install without new ductwork. You just need to ensure the filters are clean.
3.  **Rear Venting:** Some units can vent directly out the back. This works if the microwave backs up to an exterior wall. It requires cutting a hole in the wall.

Choosing the right ventilation depends on your new spot. A cabinet installation might use recirculating. An external wall mount could use ducted or rear venting. Plan the venting carefully.

**Structural Support:**
Over-the-range microwaves are heavy. They weigh 60 to 100 pounds. Your new mounting point needs strong support.
*   **Wall Mounting:** Attach the wall bracket to wood studs. Drywall alone cannot hold the weight. Use heavy-duty toggle bolts if studs are not ideal.
*   **Cabinet Installation:** Reinforce the cabinet. Add sturdy wood supports inside the cabinet. Build a frame that can bear the microwave's weight. The shelf must be strong. You can learn about building a shelf here: [How To Build An Over The Range Microwave Shelf](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-build-an-over-the-range-microwave-shelf).
