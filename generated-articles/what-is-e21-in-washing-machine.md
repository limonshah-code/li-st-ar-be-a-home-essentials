### What Does E21 In Washing Machine Mean?

The E21 error code in a washing machine indicates a drainage problem. Your appliance struggles to pump water out of the drum. This usually happens during the wash or spin cycle. It leads to standing water and incomplete cycles.

### Common Causes of the E21 Washing Machine Error

When your washing machine displays an E21 error, it points to a drainage issue. Several factors can cause this problem. Understanding these causes helps you diagnose the issue accurately. Let's explore the most frequent culprits behind the E21 code.

#### Blocked Drain Pump Filter

The most common reason for an E21 error is a clogged drain pump filter. This filter catches lint, coins, buttons, and other debris from your laundry. Over time, these items accumulate, blocking water flow. A blocked filter prevents the pump from expelling water effectively. Cleaning this filter is often the first and simplest solution. Regularly cleaning your washing machine filter helps prevent future E21 errors. For more details on maintaining this critical component, you might find this guide helpful: [how to clean washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter).

#### Kinked or Blocked Drain Hose

Another frequent cause is an issue with the drain hose. The drain hose carries water from your washing machine to the standpipe or sink. A hose can become kinked if the machine moves. Debris can also accumulate inside the hose over time. These obstructions prevent water from flowing freely. Ensure the hose has a clear path and no twists.

#### Faulty Drain Pump

If the filter and hose are clear, the drain pump itself might be faulty. The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the machine. Mechanical wear, electrical problems, or internal blockages can cause it to fail. A malfunctioning pump cannot perform its job. This leads to the E21 error code. Replacing a faulty drain pump usually requires professional assistance.

#### Issues with Water Level Sensor

Less commonly, the E21 error could stem from a malfunctioning water level sensor. This sensor tells the machine how much water is in the drum. If it gives incorrect readings, the machine might believe it cannot drain water properly. This can trigger the E21 code. Sensor issues are often harder to diagnose without specialized tools.

#### Control Board Malfunction

In rare cases, the main control board can cause an E21 error. The control board acts as the brain of your washing machine. It manages all functions, including drainage. A faulty board might send incorrect signals to the drain pump or misinterpret sensor data. This is typically a more expensive repair.

### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting for E21 Error

Encountering an E21 error does not always mean a costly repair. Many common causes are simple to fix yourself. By following these troubleshooting steps, you can often resolve the issue. Always remember to prioritize safety by disconnecting power.

#### Step 1: Disconnect Power and Access the Drain Filter

Before doing any work, unplug your washing machine from the wall outlet. This prevents electrical shock. Locate the drain pump filter. It is usually at the bottom front of the machine, behind a small access panel. Place a shallow tray or towels underneath. This catches any water that will spill out. Slowly unscrew the filter.

#### Step 2: Clean the Drain Pump Filter

Once you remove the filter, inspect it thoroughly. You will likely find lint, hair, coins, or other small items trapped in it. Remove all debris by hand. Rinse the filter under running water until it is completely clean. Also, check the filter housing cavity for any remaining obstructions. Blockages in this area are a common cause of drainage problems.

#### Step 3: Inspect the Drain Hose

After cleaning the filter, check the drain hose. This hose typically connects to a standpipe or a sink. Pull the machine out slightly to access the hose. Look for any visible kinks or bends in the hose. Straighten any kinks you find. If you suspect an internal blockage, detach the hose from both ends. Blow through it or flush it with water. This can dislodge any trapped debris. Ensure the hose is not pushed too far into the drainpipe. This creates an airtight seal, preventing water flow.

#### Step 4: Check the Drain Pump (Advanced)

If the filter and hose are clear, the drain pump might be the problem. With the filter removed, use a flashlight to look into the pump impeller area. Small objects can sometimes get stuck in the impeller, preventing it from spinning. Carefully remove any visible obstructions. You can also try to manually spin the impeller. It should turn freely. If it feels stiff or does not move, the pump could be faulty. This repair often requires removing the back or front panel of the washing machine. This task is more involved.

#### Step 5: Reset the Washing Machine

After performing checks and clearing any blockages, reassemble everything. Reconnect the drain filter and ensure the drain hose is properly installed. Plug the washing machine back into power. Perform a machine reset. For most models, this involves turning the machine off and on again. Some models might require holding down a specific button combination for a few seconds. Consult your appliance's user manual for exact reset instructions. Running an empty rinse and spin cycle can test the repair.

### Preventing Future E21 Errors

Preventing issues is always better than fixing them. A few simple maintenance practices can help you avoid the E21 error. These steps extend the life of your washing machine. They also ensure smooth operation.
