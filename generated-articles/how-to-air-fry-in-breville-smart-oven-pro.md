## How To Air Fry In Breville Smart Oven Pro

Welcome to the world of versatile cooking! The Breville Smart Oven Pro is more than just a toaster oven. It offers many cooking functions, including a powerful air fry setting. If you want to achieve crispy textures and enjoy healthier versions of your favorite fried foods, you came to the right place. I often rely on my Breville oven for quick weeknight meals.

This guide will show you exactly how to air fry in your Breville Smart Oven Pro. We will cover everything from understanding the air fry function to mastering cooking techniques. You will learn about essential accessories, optimal settings, and cleaning tips. Let's make some delicious, crispy food together!

### Takeaway

*   Use the "Air Fry" setting for best results.
*   Always use the Breville air fry basket and roast pan.
*   Preheat the oven for even cooking.
*   Do not overcrowd the basket.
*   Clean accessories regularly for hygiene and performance.

You can air fry in the Breville Smart Oven Pro by selecting the "Air Fry" setting, using the dedicated air fry basket, and adjusting temperature and time. The powerful convection fan ensures rapid, even cooking for crispy foods.

## Understanding the Breville Smart Oven Pro's Air Fry Feature

The Breville Smart Oven Pro is a highly functional kitchen appliance. It combines several cooking methods into one compact unit. One of its most popular features is the air fry function. This capability allows you to create dishes that taste similar to deep-fried items.

This air fry function relies on strong convection. A powerful fan circulates hot air rapidly around your food. This hot air movement cooks food evenly and creates a crispy outer layer. Think of it as a small, high-powered convection oven. The Breville Smart Oven Pro includes specific elements designed to improve this process.

The main difference between the "Air Fry" setting and a standard "Convection Bake" setting is the fan speed and heat distribution. The air fry mode uses a much higher fan speed. This faster air circulation is key to achieving that characteristic crispy texture. It mimics the effect of deep frying, but with significantly less oil. This helps you enjoy healthier versions of your favorite snacks.

The Breville Smart Oven Pro often comes with an air fry basket. This basket allows air to circulate around the food from all sides. It also has a special roast pan that sits below the basket. This pan catches any drips, keeping your oven cleaner. These components are important for proper air frying. Using them correctly helps ensure optimal results and makes cleanup easier.

## Setting Up for Success: Essential Accessories and Placement

Proper setup is important when you air fry in your Breville Smart Oven Pro. Using the correct accessories ensures air circulates properly. This circulation gives your food that desired crispy texture. The Breville oven typically includes key pieces for air frying.

First, identify the air fry basket. This basket is usually a wire mesh basket designed to hold food. Its open design allows hot air to reach all surfaces of the food. Do not skip using this basket. It is important for successful air frying.

Next, find the roast pan. This is a solid, rectangular pan. It fits directly underneath the air fry basket. The roast pan catches any oil drips or food crumbs during cooking. This keeps the oven interior cleaner and prevents smoke. Always place the air fry basket on top of the roast pan.

For optimal rack placement, consult your oven's manual. Generally, the air fry basket and roast pan combo sits on the middle rack position. This position allows the circulating hot air to distribute evenly around the food. Placing it too high or too low can lead to uneven cooking. Your manual often shows diagrams for each cooking function.

Preparing your food before air frying also helps. For example, some recipes suggest patting food dry. Excess moisture can prevent crisping. A light coating of oil also helps achieve a golden, crispy finish. This oil helps with browning and texture. You can use a spray bottle for even oil distribution.

Consider safety during setup. Always use oven mitts when handling hot accessories. The oven becomes very hot during operation. Make sure there is enough space around the oven for ventilation. This prevents overheating. Proper setup leads to better air frying results.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Air Frying Any Dish

Air frying in your Breville Smart Oven Pro is a simple process. Following these steps will help you achieve perfect results. I find that a consistent approach yields the best crispy texture every time.

First, **prepare your food**. Cut food into uniform pieces for even cooking. For items like chicken wings or fries, a light drizzle of oil is helpful. Toss the food to coat it evenly. This helps with browning and crisping.

Next, **arrange the food in the air fry basket**. Do not overcrowd the basket. Leave space between pieces. Overcrowding blocks airflow and results in soggy food. If you have a lot of food, cook it in batches. This ensures every piece gets enough hot air exposure.

Now, **preheat your oven**. Place the air fry basket, resting on the roast pan, onto the correct rack. Close the oven door. Turn the function dial to "Air Fry." The oven display will show a default temperature and time. Adjust the temperature to your recipe's recommendation. Press "Start." The oven will begin preheating. Preheating is important for consistent cooking. Many air fryers need to preheat to work well. This prepares the cooking chamber for immediate and even heat distribution. If you want to know more about preheat times, check this out: [How long does Breville air fryer take to preheat?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-does-breville-air-fryer-take-to-preheat)

Once preheated, the oven will beep. It will automatically start the cooking timer. During cooking, **shake or flip your food halfway through**. This ensures even browning on all sides. For fries, I usually give the basket a good shake. For larger items like chicken, I use tongs to flip them. This step is important for getting a consistent crisp.

Finally, **check for doneness**. Use a meat thermometer for proteins to ensure they reach a safe internal temperature. For vegetables and starches, look for golden brown color and crisp texture. If your food needs more time, add a few extra minutes. When cooking finishes, the oven will beep and turn off. Carefully remove the basket using oven mitts. Let the food rest for a minute or two before serving. This brief rest helps the food hold its crispness.

## Optimizing Results: Tips for Crispy, Delicious Air-Fried Food

Achieving consistently crispy and delicious air-fried food requires a few key practices. These tips will help you get the most out of your Breville Smart Oven Pro's air fry function. I have used these techniques myself to perfect various dishes.

First, **do not overcrowd the air fry basket**. This is perhaps the most important rule. Air fryers work by circulating hot air around food. If the basket is too full, air cannot reach all surfaces. This leads to steaming instead of frying, resulting in soggy food. Cook in multiple batches if necessary. It takes a little longer, but the results are worth it.

Next, **pat food dry before adding oil and seasoning**. Excess moisture on the surface of food prevents browning and crisping. For example, when air frying potato wedges, I always pat them very dry with a paper towel. This step helps achieve a fantastic crunch. A dry surface allows the oil to interact directly with the food, promoting crispness.

**Use minimal oil, but use some oil**. Air frying uses far less oil than deep frying. However, a light coating of oil helps food crisp up and brown beautifully. It also helps seasonings stick. A spray bottle works well for even distribution. Olive oil, avocado oil, or vegetable oil are all good choices. Too much oil can make food greasy.

**Shake or flip your food often**. For smaller items like fries or Brussels sprouts, shaking the basket halfway through cooking promotes even crisping. For larger items such as chicken pieces, flip them over. This ensures all sides get exposed to the hot circulating air. This prevents one side from becoming overly browned while the other remains pale.

**Always preheat your Breville Smart Oven Pro**. Just like a traditional oven, preheating ensures the cooking chamber is at the correct temperature from the start. Placing food into a cold air fryer can impact cooking times and crispness. The oven needs to be hot enough for the immediate cooking process to begin effectively.

Finally, **check on your food frequently**. Air fryers cook faster than conventional ovens. Cooking times are often shorter. Start checking your food a few minutes before the recipe suggests. This prevents burning and allows you to adjust timing for perfect doneness. A simple visual check helps determine if your food is golden and crispy enough.

## What to Air Fry: Popular Recipes and Meal Ideas

The Breville Smart Oven Pro's air fry function opens up a world of culinary possibilities. Many foods cook wonderfully in an air fryer. I often experiment with new recipes, and the results are consistently good. Here are some popular ideas to get you started.

**Frozen Foods:** The air fryer excels at making frozen foods taste better than oven-baked versions.
*   **Frozen French Fries:** My personal favorite. They come out incredibly crispy, like deep-fried. Cook at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway.
*   **Chicken Nuggets/Strips:** These get a great crunch. Cook according to package directions, but typically at 375°F (190°C) for 10-15 minutes.
*   **Mozzarella Sticks:** Crispy outside, gooey inside. Air fry for 6-8 minutes at 375°F (190°C).

**Fresh Vegetables:** Air frying transforms vegetables, giving them a delightful texture and flavor.
*   **Broccoli or Brussels Sprouts:** Toss with a little oil, salt, and pepper. Air fry at 375°F (190°C) for 10-15 minutes until tender-crisp and slightly charred.
*   **Cauliflower:** Similar to broccoli, it becomes caramelized and delicious.
*   **Sweet Potato Fries:** Cut into uniform sticks, toss with oil, salt, and paprika. Air fry at 380°F (195°C) for 15-20 minutes, shaking often.
*   **Asparagus:** Quick and easy. Toss with oil and seasoning. Air fry for 8-10 minutes at 375°F (190°C).

**Proteins:** You can achieve juicy interiors and crispy exteriors on various proteins.
*   **Chicken Wings:** A classic air fryer dish. Toss with a little baking powder, salt, and pepper for extra crispiness. Air fry at 380°F (195°C) for 20-25 minutes, then increase to 400°F (200°C) for the last 5-10 minutes to crisp up.
*   **Salmon Fillets:** Brush with oil and season. Air fry at 375°F (190°C) for 10-14 minutes, depending on thickness.
*   **Pork Chops:** Get a nice sear and stay juicy. Air fry at 375°F (190°C) for 12-15 minutes, flipping once.

**Reheating Leftovers:** Air frying is excellent for reheating. It brings back the crispness that microwaving destroys.
*   **Pizza:** Reheat slices at 350°F (175°C) for 5-7 minutes. The crust becomes crispy, and the cheese melts perfectly.
*   **Fried Chicken:** Reheat for 8-10 minutes at 350°F (175°C) for crispy, hot results.

Remember to adjust cooking times and temperatures based on your specific Breville model and food thickness. Experimentation is key to discovering your favorites.

## Maintaining Your Breville Smart Oven Pro Air Fryer

Proper maintenance of your Breville Smart Oven Pro ensures its longevity and performance. Regular cleaning is important, especially after air frying. Foods can leave grease and crumbs inside. I make it a point to clean my oven after every few uses.

First, **focus on the air fry basket and roast pan**. These accessories collect the most grease and food residue. After each use, let them cool completely. Then, wash them with warm, soapy water. A soft sponge or brush works well to remove stubborn bits. For baked-on food, you can soak them in hot soapy water for about 15-20 minutes before scrubbing. Ensure they are completely dry before storing them away. This prevents rust and odors.

Next, **clean the interior of the oven**. The Breville Smart Oven Pro has a non-stick interior, which makes cleaning easier. Use a damp cloth with a mild dish soap solution. Wipe down the walls, floor, and ceiling of the oven. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads. These can damage the non-stick coating. Pay special attention to any grease splatters. You can also clean the temperature probes if they become dirty.

**Clean the crumb tray regularly**. This tray slides out from the bottom front of the oven. It collects crumbs and small food particles. Empty it after every use to prevent burnt odors and potential fire hazards. Wash it with warm, soapy water as needed.

**Clean the exterior** with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals on the exterior. This maintains the oven's appearance. Do not spray water directly onto the oven. Never submerge the oven in water.

**Safety precautions** are important during cleaning. Always unplug the oven before cleaning. Make sure the oven is completely cool. This prevents burns and electrical hazards. Avoid getting water into the heating elements or fan opening.

Regular cleaning helps your Breville Smart Oven Pro perform efficiently. It also prevents smoke buildup and bad odors during cooking. A clean oven means better-tasting air-fried food every time.

## Comparing Air Frying in the Breville with Dedicated Air Fryers

Many people wonder how the air fry function in the Breville Smart Oven Pro compares to a standalone air fryer. Both appliances perform the same basic function: circulating hot air to crisp food. However, there are some differences worth noting. I have used both types of appliances extensively.

**Versatility is a major advantage for the Breville Smart Oven Pro.** It is a multi-function appliance. Beyond air frying, it can toast, bake, roast, broil, and even dehydrate. A dedicated air fryer typically only air fries. If kitchen counter space is limited, the Breville oven offers more utility in one footprint. You get many cooking options from a single appliance.

**Capacity often favors the Breville Smart Oven Pro.** Most dedicated basket-style air fryers have a smaller cooking capacity. The Breville Smart Oven Pro, being a countertop oven, generally offers a larger internal volume. This means you can air fry more food at once. This is a big plus for families or when cooking for guests. You can cook a whole chicken or a larger batch of wings.

**The cooking mechanism is similar but not identical.** Both use high-speed convection. The Breville oven has heating elements on top and bottom, which helps with even cooking across its larger cavity. Dedicated air fryers often have heating elements primarily at the top, with a powerful fan below. The principle is the same, but the execution adapts to the design.

**Ease of use and cleanup can vary.** Dedicated air fryers with pull-out baskets are often very easy to clean. The Breville's basket and pan are also simple to wash. However, cleaning the entire interior of a larger oven can take more effort than a small air fryer drawer. Consider your cleaning preferences.

**Cost is another factor.** A Breville Smart Oven Pro is usually more expensive than a basic dedicated air fryer. However, when you consider all the functions it replaces (toaster, small oven), it might be more cost-effective in the long run. It offers more value for its price.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your needs. If you only want to air fry and have minimal counter space, a dedicated air fryer might be suitable. If you desire a versatile kitchen workhorse that can air fry alongside many other functions, the Breville Smart Oven Pro is an excellent choice. It performs air frying very well, making it a strong contender for many kitchens. You can even use it for specific dishes like jacket potatoes: [How to cook jacket potatoes in Samsung smart oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-cook-jacket-potatoes-in-samsung-smart-oven).
