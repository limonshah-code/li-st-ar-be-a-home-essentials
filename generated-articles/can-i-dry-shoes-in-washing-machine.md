## Drying Shoes in Your Washing Machine: A Guide

We all face the wet shoe dilemma. Maybe your favorite sneakers got caught in the rain. Perhaps you just finished washing them, and now they are soaking wet. A common thought pops up: "Can I dry shoes in a washing machine?" It seems like a quick solution.

However, using your washing machine to dry shoes is not always a good idea. Washing machines are for washing. Dedicated dryers are for drying. While some washing machines offer specific "drying" or "air dry" cycles, these are very different from a tumble dryer's heat-based drying. This article will explain why trying to dry shoes in a washing machine can damage both your footwear and your appliance. We will also explore safe and effective ways to get your shoes dry without risk.

### Takeaway

*   **Avoid machine drying:** Do not use your washing machine for drying shoes.
*   **Washing machine cycles are not dryers:** "Air Dry" or "Spin Dry" cycles do not provide the heat needed for true drying.
*   **Risk damage:** Attempting to dry shoes this way can harm shoes and the appliance.
*   **Use safe methods:** Air dry, use a fan, or use a dedicated shoe dryer for best results.

### Can You Dry Shoes in a Washing Machine?

No, you generally cannot effectively or safely dry shoes in a washing machine. Washing machines are designed to wash clothes with water and detergent. They spin to remove excess water. While some models feature "air dry" or "spin dry" functions, these cycles do not use heat. They cannot fully dry shoes. Using them for this purpose risks damage to both your shoes and the machine itself.

### Understanding Your Appliances: Washing Machines Versus Dedicated Dryers

Many people confuse the functions of washing machines and clothes dryers. It is an easy mistake to make. Understanding the core difference is important for shoe care.

A washing machine's main job is to clean items. It uses water, detergent, and agitation to remove dirt. After washing, a spin cycle removes excess water from items. This spin cycle prepares clothes for drying. It does not actually dry them. The clothes come out damp, not dry.

A dedicated clothes dryer, however, uses heat and tumbling. It circulates warm or hot air to evaporate moisture. This is how it dries clothes completely. Dryers have specific settings for different fabrics. They remove water through heat. Many modern dryers also include special racks or settings for delicate items like shoes. For example, knowing [how to dry shoes in a Samsung dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-dry-shoes-in-samsung-dryer) or [how to dry shoes in an Electrolux dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-dry-shoes-in-electrolux-dryer) highlights the availability of dedicated shoe drying features in actual dryers, which washing machines lack.

The difference is clear. Washing machines wash and remove most water through spinning. Dryers use heat to evaporate remaining moisture. Do not expect your washing machine to perform like a dryer. Each appliance has its specific purpose in your laundry routine.

### Exploring Washing Machine "Drying" Cycles: Do They Work for Shoes?

Some washing machines advertise "drying" features. These functions can be misleading. They are not the same as a tumble dryer. Common terms you might see include "Air Dry," "Spin Dry," or "Dehydrate" cycles. Let's look at what these cycles actually do.

An "Air Dry" cycle typically uses ambient air. It runs the drum without heat. It may also use the machine's internal fan if it has one. This cycle aims to reduce moisture further after a spin. It helps prevent mildew. However, it will not fully dry thick items like shoes. It cannot remove all the water without heat. If you have an LG washing machine, you might find details on [what is LG washing machine air dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-lg-washing-machine-air-dry) functionality. This feature usually just spins items at a high speed. It can also circulate room temperature air. It does not provide heat to evaporate water.

The "Spin Dry" cycle is even more basic. It is simply the final spin. The machine spins at very high speeds. This centrifugal force pushes water out of the fabric. The faster the spin, the more water is removed. Clothes will still feel damp after this cycle. Shoes will be very damp. This cycle is for water extraction. It is not for drying. For example, while some washing machines might remove a lot of water from clothes, like when discussing if [does LG washing machine dry clothes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-lg-washing-machine-dry-clothes), the answer for *complete* drying is usually no. This is true for other brands too, such as whether a [Samsung washing machine dries clothes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-samsung-washing-machine-dry-clothes) or if a [Beko washing machine dries clothes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-beko-washing-machine-dry-clothes). These machines are washers, not dryers.

These washing machine cycles are limited. They cannot generate the heat needed to dry shoes thoroughly. They mostly focus on removing water mechanically. They will leave your shoes damp, at best. This dampness can lead to new problems.

### The Risks: Why Drying Shoes in a Washing Machine is Often a Bad Idea

Attempting to dry shoes in your washing machine can lead to significant problems. These problems affect both your shoes and your appliance. It is important to understand these risks. Avoid costly damage.

#### Damage to Your Shoes

Shoes are made from various materials. These materials react differently to heat and force. A washing machine's "drying" cycles, even without heat, still involve tumbling and spinning. This can cause harm.

*   **Shrinking and Warping:** Materials like canvas or certain synthetics can shrink or lose shape. The strong spinning forces can pull and distort the shoe's structure. Soles might warp.
*   **Adhesive Breakdown:** Many shoes use adhesives to bind parts together. Excessive spinning and the lingering dampness can weaken these glues. This leads to sole separation. Your shoes might fall apart prematurely.
*   **Material Degradation:** Delicates like mesh, foam, or specific synthetic weaves can tear or fray. The constant banging around in the drum is abrasive. It wears down shoe materials much faster.
*   **Odor and Mildew Growth:** Since the washing machine cannot fully dry shoes, they remain damp. This damp environment is perfect for bacteria and mildew. You might end up with smellier shoes than before. Preventing mildew and maintaining cleanliness is key to [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean) in the long run.

#### Damage to Your Washing Machine

Your washing machine is not designed for heavy, hard items like shoes. Placing shoes inside for any "drying" cycle, especially spin, creates risks.

*   **Imbalance and Excessive Vibration:** Shoes are not balanced like clothes. They create an uneven load. During high-speed spins, this imbalance causes severe vibrations. The machine can shake violently.
*   **Noise and Wear and Tear:** The constant banging of shoes against the drum walls is very noisy. This impact can damage the drum itself. It can also stress the machine's internal components. Bearings, suspension, and even the motor can suffer increased wear.
*   **Door and Gasket Damage:** If shoes get caught near the door or its rubber gasket, they can cause tears or leaks. This leads to expensive repairs.

In summary, the risks outweigh any perceived convenience. It is safer to use alternative drying methods. Protect both your investment in shoes and your appliance.

### Identifying Shoe Types Suitable for Washing (But Not Machine Drying)

While this article focuses on drying, it is worth noting which shoes can handle a washing machine's wash cycle. It's important to know the difference between washing and drying capabilities. Not all shoes can go into a washing machine for cleaning, let alone for any "drying" attempt.

Shoes made from durable materials are generally safer to wash. These include:

*   **Canvas Sneakers:** Think Converse or Keds. Their sturdy canvas can handle a gentle wash cycle.
*   **Athletic Shoes (Sneakers):** Most running shoes or trainers with mesh, nylon, or synthetic uppers can be washed. Remove laces and insoles first.
*   **Some Synthetic Materials:** Certain modern synthetic blends are machine washable. Always check the care tag. For specific brands, you might wonder [can you wash shoes in LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-lg-washing-machine) or [can you wash shoes in Bosch washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-bosch-washing-machine). Generally, a gentle cycle is best. Similarly, if you own Miele appliances, understanding [can I wash shoes in Miele washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-wash-shoes-in-miele-washing-machine) involves checking specific model instructions and using mesh bags.

However, even if a shoe is washable, it does not mean it is machine-dryable. The delicate nature of these shoes means they will not withstand the harshness of a washing machine's spin or "air dry" cycle.

Shoes you should **never** put in a washing machine, even for washing, include:

*   **Leather Shoes:** Water can stain, crack, or stiffen leather. Heat from any attempted drying will cause permanent damage.
*   **Suede or Nubuck Shoes:** These materials are very sensitive to water. They lose their texture and can be ruined.
*   **Embellished Shoes:** Shoes with beads, sequins, embroidery, or delicate parts will likely fall apart.
*   **Dress Shoes or Heels:** These are often structured with delicate glues and materials not meant for machine washing or drying.
*   **Patent Leather Shoes:** While some leathers can tolerate gentle cleaning, you generally cannot put [patent leather shoes in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-patent-leather-shoes-in-the-washing-machine) because it can damage the finish.

Always refer to the shoe's care label. When in doubt, hand wash or spot clean. Then, choose a safe drying method.

### Safe and Effective Methods to Dry Shoes After Washing

Since using your washing machine for drying shoes is not ideal, you need safe alternatives. Proper drying prevents damage to your shoes. It also avoids bad odors or mildew. Here are reliable ways to dry your shoes after washing them.

#### Air Drying

This is the simplest and safest method. It works well for most shoe types.

*   **Find a well-ventilated area:** Choose a spot with good airflow. This could be near an open window or a fan.
*   **Remove laces and insoles:** These items trap moisture. Dry them separately.
*   **Stuff with newspaper or paper towels:** Crumple clean, plain newspaper or paper towels. Stuff them inside the shoes. They absorb moisture effectively. Change the paper every few hours. Avoid colored newspaper, as ink can transfer.
*   **Position for airflow:** Place shoes on their side or hang them. This allows air to circulate inside and around the shoe.

#### Using a Fan

A fan significantly speeds up air drying. This is a very effective method.

*   **Set up the fan:** Place the fan in a room with good airflow.
*   **Position the shoes:** Place shoes a few feet in front of the fan. Ensure the airflow goes directly into the shoe openings.
*   **Elevate shoes:** You can prop them up on a wire rack or even hang them from coat hangers. This helps air reach all sides.
*   **Rotate shoes:** Turn the shoes periodically. This ensures even drying.

#### Dedicated Shoe Dryers or Racks

These appliances are designed specifically for drying shoes. They offer controlled heat or airflow.

*   **Shoe Dryers:** These devices often use gentle, warm air. They fit inside the shoes. They dry from the inside out. They prevent shrinking or damage.
*   **Drying Racks for Tumble Dryers:** Some clothes dryers come with a special rack. This rack attaches inside the dryer drum. You place shoes on it. The rack keeps shoes stationary while the dryer runs. This prevents tumbling. It uses heat safely. Always check if your dryer has this feature. For instance, [how to dry shoes in a Samsung dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-dry-shoes-in-samsung-dryer) often involves using such a rack. Similarly, an Electrolux dryer may have similar options, as discussed in guides like [how to dry shoes in an Electrolux dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-dry-shoes-in-electrolux-dryer).

#### Using a Dehumidifier

In humid environments, a dehumidifier can assist.

*   **Place shoes near the dehumidifier:** The dehumidifier will remove moisture from the air. This helps the shoes dry faster.

Choose the method that suits your shoes and your available equipment. Prioritizing gentle, consistent drying will extend the life of your footwear.

### Preparing Your Shoes for Optimal Drying (Regardless of Method)

Proper preparation is crucial. It ensures your shoes dry efficiently. It also minimizes any potential damage. This applies no matter how you choose to dry them.

#### 1. Pre-Clean Your Shoes

Before any drying, ensure your shoes are clean. If they just came out of the washing machine, they should be clean. If they are just wet from rain or a puddle, consider a quick rinse. Dirt and grime can become set in once dry. This makes them harder to remove later. A guide on [how to wash smelly shoes in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-smelly-shoes-in-washing-machine) can help ensure they are truly clean before drying. Remember, cleanliness is a key step in [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean) overall.

#### 2. Remove Laces and Insoles

Laces and insoles trap a lot of water. They dry much slower than the shoe itself. Remove them before drying. This allows better airflow into the shoe. Dry laces and insoles separately. You can hang them or lay them flat.

#### 3. Blot and Gently Squeeze Out Excess Water

Do not put soaking wet shoes directly into drying. Use an old towel to blot the outside of the shoes. Press gently to absorb surface water. For fabric shoes, you can gently squeeze. Do not twist or wring hard. This can distort the shoe's shape. This step helps speed up the overall drying process.

#### 4. Shape the Shoes

As shoes dry, they can sometimes lose their original shape. Stuff them lightly with clean newspaper or paper towels. This helps maintain their form. It also absorbs moisture from the inside. Replace the paper periodically as it becomes damp. Do not overstuff, as this can stretch the shoe.

#### 5. Use a Mesh Laundry Bag (for washing, then air drying)

If you plan to wash your shoes in the washing machine first, use a mesh laundry bag. This protects them during the wash cycle. It prevents them from banging around too much. After washing, you can take them out of the bag for air drying. The bag is not for machine drying. It helps protect the shoe during the wash.

Following these steps makes the drying process easier. It helps your shoes maintain their quality and appearance.

### Addressing Common Post-Wash Shoe Drying Challenges

Even with proper methods, you might face some issues when drying shoes. Understanding these challenges helps you find solutions. It ensures your shoes are dry, fresh, and ready to wear.

#### Lingering Dampness or Odor

Sometimes, shoes feel dry on the outside but stay damp inside. This is common with thick soles or padding. This dampness leads to bad odors or mildew.

*   **Increase airflow:** Position shoes in a stronger draft or directly in front of a fan.
*   **Change stuffing often:** If using newspaper or paper towels, change them more frequently. They absorb moisture from deep within the shoe.
*   **Use moisture absorbers:** Place small sachets of silica gel inside the shoes. These absorb remaining humidity.
*   **Odor control:** If an odor persists, sprinkle baking soda inside the dry shoes. Let it sit overnight. Then, shake it out. Baking soda absorbs smells.

#### Stiffness

Some shoe materials can become stiff after drying. This often happens with canvas or certain synthetic leathers.

*   **Gentle flexing:** Once the shoes are dry, gently flex them. Bend and twist them lightly. This helps restore flexibility.
*   **Wear them briefly:** Walking in them for a short period can help break them in again.
*   **Moisturize (for specific materials):** For leather, if it feels stiff after drying, use a leather conditioner. This restores softness and prevents cracking.

#### Molding Prevention

Mold and mildew thrive in damp, dark environments. Preventing them is key to shoe longevity.

*   **Ensure complete dryness:** This is the most important step. Never store shoes that are even slightly damp.
*   **Store in ventilated areas:** Avoid storing shoes in closed, damp closets. Use shoe racks that allow air circulation.
*   **Air out regularly:** Even when not wet, air out your shoes periodically. This prevents moisture buildup from sweat.

By knowing these common problems and their solutions, you can handle any drying challenge. This keeps your shoes in better condition for longer.
