## How Much Are Whirlpool Microwave Ovens: A Comprehensive Buying Guide

Are you looking for a new microwave oven? Whirlpool is a name many people trust in kitchen appliances. But when you start to shop, a common question comes up: how much are Whirlpool microwave ovens? Knowing the price range helps you plan your budget. I know this from personal experience, as I recently went through this exact process myself.

Finding the right Whirlpool microwave oven means more than just picking a price tag. You need to consider its features, type, and size. This guide will break down the costs involved. We will look at what makes prices go up or down. We will also explore the different types of Whirlpool microwaves available. This way, you can make a smart choice for your kitchen.

### Takeaway

*   Whirlpool microwave oven prices vary widely based on type, features, and capacity.
*   Countertop models are generally the most affordable, ranging from $100 to $300.
*   Over-the-range units cost more, typically between $200 and $600, offering ventilation.
*   Built-in and convection models represent higher investments, often $400 to over $1,000.
*   Advanced features like sensor cooking, inverter technology, and smart connectivity add to the overall price.
*   Look for sales, bundles, and refurbished options to save money on your purchase.

Whirlpool microwave ovens generally range from $100 for basic countertop models to over $1,000 for advanced built-in or convection units. The final price depends on the specific type, size, power, and extra features like sensor cooking, smart technology, or grilling capabilities. Your budget will guide your selection.

## Understanding Whirlpool Microwave Oven Pricing

Whirlpool offers many microwave ovens. This means prices can change a lot. A small, basic model will cost less than a large one with many features. Understanding these general price levels helps you set your expectations. It also prepares you for what you might spend.

Entry-level Whirlpool microwaves are very affordable. These are often compact countertop models. They perform basic tasks like reheating and defrosting. You might find these for under $150. They are a good option if you need a simple, reliable appliance without many frills.

Mid-range Whirlpool microwaves give you more options. They might have slightly larger capacities or some extra cooking presets. You will often see models in this range with sensor cooking. This feature adjusts cooking time automatically. These models typically fall between $200 and $500.

High-end Whirlpool microwaves come with advanced technology. These units often include convection cooking capabilities. They can also be built-in or over-the-range models. They might have smart features that connect to your phone. Prices for these can go from $500 to over $1,000. These are for kitchens that demand top performance and integration.

The brand name itself, Whirlpool, often represents good value. They balance quality with reasonable pricing. They are not always the cheapest option on the market. However, they are known for their durability and customer support. This makes the investment worthwhile for many households.

## Factors Influencing Whirlpool Microwave Oven Costs

Many things affect how much a Whirlpool microwave oven costs. Understanding these factors helps you see why prices vary. It also guides you to the right model for your needs and budget. I always consider these points when looking at new appliances.

First, the *type* of microwave makes a big difference. Countertop models are often the least expensive. Over-the-range (OTR) microwaves cost more because they include a fan and light. Built-in models are typically the priciest. They need special installation and often have a more integrated design.

Second, *capacity* plays a role. A small, compact microwave for a dorm room or small apartment will be cheaper. Larger microwaves, especially those designed for family-sized dishes, cost more. Capacity is measured in cubic feet. More cubic feet usually means a higher price tag.

Third, *power output* affects the cost. Microwaves with higher wattage cook food faster and more evenly. Most home microwaves are between 700 and 1200 watts. A 1000-watt model will generally cost more than a 700-watt one. Higher power means quicker meal preparation.

Finally, *features and technology* significantly impact the price. Basic models simply heat food. Advanced models have sensor cooking, which detects moisture and humidity to prevent overcooking. Inverter technology provides a steady stream of power for more even cooking. Convection features allow the microwave to act as a second oven, roasting and baking. Smart features, like Wi-Fi connectivity, also add to the price. These extras improve convenience but raise the cost.

## Whirlpool Microwave Oven Types and Their Price Ranges

Whirlpool offers several types of microwave ovens. Each type serves different needs and comes with its own price range. Knowing these differences helps you choose the best fit for your kitchen layout and cooking habits. I find it helpful to categorize them this way.

### Countertop Whirlpool Microwaves

These are the most common and often the most affordable. You simply place them on your kitchen counter. They are easy to install; just plug them in. Whirlpool countertop microwaves come in various sizes, from compact to large.

*   **Price Range:** Typically **$100 to $300**.
*   **Capacity:** Ranges from 0.7 cubic feet for small models to 2.2 cubic feet for larger ones.
*   **Features:** Basic models offer standard heating. Higher-end countertop models might include sensor cooking, preset buttons, or even inverter technology for better cooking. They are perfect for small kitchens or as a secondary microwave.

### Over-the-Range (OTR) Whirlpool Microwaves

Over-the-range microwaves are installed above your cooktop or range. They save counter space. They also include a ventilation system to clear smoke and odors from your cooking area. This dual functionality adds to their cost. If you are learning [how to use a Whirlpool over-the-range microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-whirlpool-over-the-range-microwave), you will appreciate their integrated design.

*   **Price Range:** Generally **$200 to $600**.
*   **Capacity:** Usually larger, from 1.7 to 2.1 cubic feet.
*   **Features:** They often include multiple fan speeds, bright cooktop lighting, and a range of cooking functions. Some have sensor cooking or steam cooking options. Installation can be more involved, often requiring professional help.

### Built-in Whirlpool Microwaves

Built-in microwaves are designed to be installed into cabinetry or a wall. They offer a seamless, integrated look in a modern kitchen. They usually do not have a ventilation system, assuming you have a separate range hood. Their sleek design and need for custom installation contribute to their higher price.

*   **Price Range:** Expect to pay **$400 to $1,000+**.
*   **Capacity:** Similar to OTR models, usually 1.6 to 2.2 cubic feet.
*   **Features:** These models often boast advanced features like convection cooking, touch controls, and sophisticated aesthetics. They can be part of a complete kitchen suite, matching other Whirlpool appliances. They are ideal for custom kitchen designs.

### Convection Whirlpool Microwaves

Some Whirlpool microwaves offer convection cooking. This means they can roast, bake, and crisp food like a traditional oven. They combine the speed of a microwave with the browning capabilities of an oven. You can even [bake in a Whirlpool microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-bake-in-whirlpool-microwave) or [grill in a Whirlpool microwave oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-grill-in-whirlpool-microwave-oven) if it has this feature. This versatility makes them a premium option. For more details on this, you might look into [how to use a Whirlpool microwave convection oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-whirlpool-microwave-convection-oven).

*   **Price Range:** These are generally at the higher end, from **$300 to $1,000+**, depending on if they are countertop, OTR, or built-in models.
*   **Capacity:** Varies, but often on the larger side to accommodate oven-like dishes.
*   **Features:** True convection fan and heating element, multiple cooking modes, often a rack for multi-level cooking. They are a great choice for smaller kitchens that need a second oven option.

## Key Features that Affect Whirlpool Microwave Oven Prices

Beyond the basic type, specific features significantly impact the price of Whirlpool microwave ovens. These features add convenience, improve cooking results, and sometimes offer smart capabilities. When comparing models, I always look at these details.

### Sensor Cooking Technology

Many mid-range and high-end Whirlpool microwaves include sensor cooking. This technology uses a sensor to detect humidity levels in the food. It then adjusts the cooking time and power level automatically. This prevents overcooking or undercooking. You do not need to guess how long to cook something.

*   **Impact on Price:** Models with sensor cooking are generally **$50 to $150 more expensive** than those without.
*   **Benefit:** Provides perfectly cooked food consistently. It reduces wasted food and energy from reheating.

### Inverter Technology

Traditional microwaves cycle power on and off to reduce power levels. This can lead to uneven cooking. Inverter technology provides a continuous, steady stream of power at reduced levels. This ensures more even cooking and defrosting. It is especially beneficial for delicate foods.

*   **Impact on Price:** Microwaves with inverter technology usually cost **$75 to $200 more**.
*   **Benefit:** Delivers more uniform heating. This results in better texture and taste for your food. It also often makes the microwave more energy efficient.

### Smart Features and Connectivity

Some of Whirlpool's newer, higher-end microwaves offer smart features. These units connect to your home Wi-Fi. You can control them using an app on your smartphone. This allows you to start or stop cooking from another room. You might also receive notifications when food is ready. Some models even integrate with voice assistants.

*   **Impact on Price:** Smart features can add **$100 to $300 or more** to the price.
*   **Benefit:** Offers ultimate convenience and flexibility. It lets you monitor cooking progress remotely.

### Preset Cooking Options and Convenience Features

Almost all microwaves have preset buttons for common foods like popcorn or pizza. More advanced Whirlpool models have a wider array of presets. They might include options for melting butter, softening ice cream, or steaming vegetables. Express cook buttons (e.g., 30-second add-on) are also popular.

*   **Impact on Price:** More presets and specialized convenience features incrementally increase the cost, typically **$20 to $100**.
*   **Benefit:** Simplifies cooking tasks. It reduces guesswork and makes using the microwave quicker and easier.

### Design and Finish

The exterior finish also affects the price. Standard white or black microwaves are often the least expensive. Stainless steel finishes are very popular and usually cost a bit more. Fingerprint-resistant stainless steel or specialized colors like black stainless steel can be even pricier. These finishes offer a more premium look.

*   **Impact on Price:** Stainless steel adds **$20 to $100**. Specialty finishes can add **$50 to $150**.
*   **Benefit:** Enhances kitchen aesthetics. It matches other appliances for a cohesive look.

## Where to Buy Whirlpool Microwave Ovens and Potential Savings

Once you know what type of Whirlpool microwave you want, the next step is finding the best place to buy it. Different retailers offer various prices, sales, and services. Knowing where to look can help you save money.

### Major Retailers

Large appliance and electronics stores are common places to buy Whirlpool microwaves. These include stores like Best Buy, Lowe's, The Home Depot, and Sears. They often have a wide selection of models. They also offer competitive pricing. You can see the models in person before buying.

*   **Pros:** Wide selection, often display models, in-store assistance, delivery and installation services.
*   **Cons:** Prices might be higher than online-only stores.
*   **Savings Tip:** Look for holiday sales (Black Friday, Memorial Day, Labor Day), clearance events, and bundle deals if buying multiple appliances.

### Online Retailers

Websites like Amazon, Wayfair, and the official Whirlpool website are great options. They usually have an even larger selection than physical stores. You can compare models easily. Prices can often be lower due to reduced overhead costs.

*   **Pros:** Vast selection, competitive pricing, customer reviews, direct shipping to your home.
*   **Cons:** Cannot see the product in person, potential for shipping damage, returns might be more complex.
*   **Savings Tip:** Sign up for email lists for exclusive discounts. Use price comparison websites. Watch for flash sales.

### Department Stores and Wholesale Clubs

Stores like JCPenney (for appliances) or Costco and Sam's Club also carry Whirlpool microwaves. Wholesale clubs often offer good value on a limited selection. They might include extended warranties or bulk discounts.

*   **Pros:** Good value, sometimes extended warranties included, specific member benefits.
*   **Cons:** Limited selection, membership required for wholesale clubs.
*   **Savings Tip:** Check for special member-only deals. Look for floor models or open-box items at a discount.

### Refurbished or Open-Box Options

Consider buying a refurbished or open-box Whirlpool microwave. These are units that were returned, lightly used, or have minor cosmetic flaws. They are fully functional but sold at a reduced price. Appliance outlets or specific sections in major retailers might carry these.

*   **Pros:** Significant savings (20-50% off retail).
*   **Cons:** Limited warranty, potential for minor blemishes. Always check the return policy.

### Used Marketplaces

For even deeper discounts, check local online marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. You might find used Whirlpool microwaves from private sellers. Always inspect the unit carefully before buying. Ask about its age and history, and make sure it turns on.

*   **Pros:** Very low prices.
*   **Cons:** No warranty, no returns, potential for hidden issues, no delivery.
*   **Safety Tip:** Meet in a public place. Bring a friend. Test the microwave thoroughly.

Comparing prices from various sources is key. I often check prices online even when I plan to buy in a physical store. This helps me negotiate or at least confirm I am getting a fair deal. Knowing [how much an LG microwave oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-is-lg-microwave-oven) costs can also give you a good comparison point for pricing.

## Maximizing Value: Getting the Best Whirlpool Microwave Oven for Your Budget

Choosing a Whirlpool microwave oven means balancing your needs with your budget. You want to get the most value for your money. This involves knowing what features are essential for you and what you can skip. I always focus on utility first, then added benefits.

### Prioritize Essential Features

Before you start shopping, make a list of what you absolutely need. Do you just need to reheat coffee and leftovers? Then a basic countertop model is perfect. Do you cook for a large family? Then capacity is key. If you are replacing an old over-the-range unit, you will likely need another OTR model.

*   **Capacity:** Determine the cubic feet you need. A single person might be fine with 0.7-1.0 cu. ft. Families might need 1.6-2.2 cu. ft.
*   **Power (Wattage):** 700-900 watts is fine for basic tasks. 1000 watts or more offers faster, more even cooking.
*   **Type:** Countertop, over-the-range, or built-in depends on your kitchen setup. Consider [how to remove a Whirlpool microwave oven combo](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-whirlpool-microwave-oven-combo) if you are replacing an existing unit.
*   **Basic Controls:** Most models have a turntable, timer, and power level settings. These are often sufficient.

### Distinguish Between Needs and Wants

After listing your needs, think about features that would be nice to have but are not critical. These are often the features that drive up the price.

*   **Wants (Often increase cost):**
    *   Sensor cooking (convenient but not essential for basic heating)
    *   Convection cooking (great for versatility, but not everyone needs a second mini-oven)
    *   Smart features (control from phone, voice commands)
    *   Advanced presets (specific vegetable settings, multi-stage cooking)
    *   Specific finishes (black stainless steel, unique colors)

If your budget is tight, skip the "wants." You can always upgrade in the future. A simple Whirlpool microwave will still do the job reliably.

### Compare Models and Read Reviews

Always compare several models within your target price range. Look at their specifications side by side. Read user reviews to get real-world insights on performance and reliability. Some models might perform better than expected for their price.

*   **Look for:** User satisfaction, common complaints, ease of use, actual performance on cooking tasks.
*   **Consider:** Energy efficiency. While not a huge factor for microwaves, some models are more efficient.

### Look for Sales and Discounts

As mentioned before, timing your purchase can lead to significant savings. Appliance sales happen frequently, especially around holidays. Sign up for store newsletters to get alerts about Whirlpool microwave promotions. Sometimes, retailers offer additional discounts for opening a store credit card.

By focusing on your actual needs, being smart about features, and shopping strategically, you can find a Whirlpool microwave oven that fits your budget perfectly. It ensures you get the best value without overspending on features you will not use.

## Longevity and Warranty: Protecting Your Whirlpool Microwave Oven Investment

When you buy a Whirlpool microwave oven, you are making an investment in your kitchen. Thinking about how long it will last and what protection comes with it is smart. This helps you understand the true cost of ownership over time.

### How Long Does a Whirlpool Microwave Last?

The lifespan of a Whirlpool microwave oven can vary. Many factors influence it. Generally, a well-maintained microwave can last between 5 and 10 years. Some people have units that last even longer. However, expecting 7-8 years of reliable service is a reasonable estimate.

*   **Factors Affecting Lifespan:**
    *   **Usage Frequency:** A microwave used multiple times a day will likely wear out faster.
    *   **Maintenance:** Cleaning the interior regularly and ensuring proper ventilation helps.
    *   **Power Surges:** Electrical issues can shorten an appliance's life.
    *   **Quality of Components:** Higher-end models might use more durable parts.

Knowing [how long a Whirlpool microwave lasts](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-does-whirlpool-microwave-last) can help you budget for future replacements. It also gives you an idea of the value you get over time. A cheaper microwave might last less, needing replacement sooner. A slightly more expensive model might save you money in the long run by enduring longer.

### Whirlpool Microwave Oven Warranty Information

Whirlpool provides a limited warranty with its microwave ovens. This warranty protects you against defects in materials or workmanship. Most new Whirlpool appliances come with a one-year limited warranty. This covers parts and labor for repairs if something goes wrong due to a manufacturing issue.

*   **What it Covers:** Typically, the magnetron (the part that produces microwaves) might have a longer warranty, sometimes up to 5 or 10 years on parts only, but labor is usually for the first year.
*   **What it Does Not Cover:** Damage from misuse, improper installation, cosmetic issues, or normal wear and tear.

It is important to understand the warranty terms. You can usually find this information in the product manual or on Whirlpool's official website. Knowing [if your Whirlpool microwave is under warranty](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-my-whirlpool-microwave-under-warranty) is crucial if you experience any problems shortly after purchase. Keep your purchase receipt. It acts as proof of purchase and start date for your warranty.

### Extended Warranties

Some retailers offer extended warranties for an additional cost. These can extend coverage beyond the manufacturer's initial period. While they add to the initial price, they can provide peace of mind. They protect against unexpected repair costs after the factory warranty expires. Consider the cost of the extended warranty versus the potential cost of a major repair. For a relatively inexpensive countertop microwave, an extended warranty might not be worth it. For a high-end built-in or convection model, it could be a sensible investment.

By considering both longevity and warranty, you can make a more informed decision. It is not just about the upfront cost. It is about the long-term value and protection for your appliance.

## Navigating Whirlpool Microwave Oven Features and Their Value

Understanding the features of Whirlpool microwave ovens helps you decide if a higher price is justified. Some features offer significant value, while others might be unnecessary for your cooking style. Let's look at common features and how they impact your experience and the appliance's cost.

### Cooking Presets and Auto-Cook Menus

Almost all Whirlpool microwaves have preset buttons. These are for common foods like popcorn, pizza, or beverages. More advanced models offer a wider range of auto-cook menus. These menus often include specific settings for vegetables, casseroles, or even defrosting different types of meat by weight.

*   **Value:** These features add convenience. They take the guesswork out of cooking. You select the food type, and the microwave does the rest.
*   **Cost Impact:** Basic presets are standard. Extensive auto-cook menus contribute to a slightly higher price.

### Turntable On/Off Option

Most microwaves use a turntable to ensure even cooking. Some larger Whirlpool models or built-in units allow you to turn the turntable off. This is useful for heating oversized dishes or rectangular pans that do not fit with the turntable rotating.

*   **Value:** Offers flexibility for larger cookware.
*   **Cost Impact:** A small addition to the price, usually found on mid-to-high range models.

### Venting System (Over-the-Range Models)

For over-the-range Whirlpool microwaves, the venting system is a key feature. It pulls smoke, steam, and odors from your cooktop. These systems vary in power, measured in Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM). Higher CFM means more effective ventilation. They also typically have different fan speeds and integrated lighting.

*   **Value:** Essential for kitchens without a separate range hood. Improves air quality.
*   **Cost Impact:** This feature is integral to OTR models and contributes significantly to their higher price compared to countertop units. Stronger ventilation systems (higher CFM) can increase the cost further.

### Child Lock and Safety Features

Many Whirlpool microwaves include a child lock. This feature prevents accidental operation, often by requiring a specific button sequence to unlock the control panel. This is a crucial safety feature for homes with young children.

*   **Value:** Provides peace of mind and prevents accidents.
*   **Cost Impact:** A standard safety feature on most models, it does not significantly impact the price.

### Quiet Operation

Some high-end Whirlpool microwaves are designed for quieter operation. This means less noise from the fan or the cooking process. While not a functional cooking feature, it improves the kitchen environment, especially in open-concept homes.

*   **Value:** Enhances comfort and reduces noise pollution in your home.
*   **Cost Impact:** Models advertised as "quiet" or "low noise" typically fall into the higher price brackets.

Considering these features helps you decide which ones are worth the extra cost for your specific needs. It ensures you invest in a Whirlpool microwave that truly fits your lifestyle and budget.

## Smart Buying Strategies for Whirlpool Microwave Ovens

Buying a Whirlpool microwave oven does not have to break the bank. With a few smart strategies, you can often find a good deal. These tips focus on timing, research, and alternative purchasing methods. I always use these when I am looking for a new appliance.

### Time Your Purchase Right

Appliance sales cycles often follow specific patterns. Major holidays are prime times for discounts. Look for deals around:

*   **Black Friday/Cyber Monday:** Typically the biggest sales event of the year.
*   **Memorial Day, Labor Day, 4th of July:** These holidays often feature appliance promotions.
*   **End-of-Year Sales:** Retailers clear out inventory for new models.
*   **New Model Releases:** When Whirlpool releases new microwave models, older versions are often discounted. This usually happens in spring or fall.

Timing your purchase to coincide with these events can save you a significant amount of money.
