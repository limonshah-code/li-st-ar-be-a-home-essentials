## Unlock a Cleaner Wash: How To Clean Your Washing Machine Inside

Is your laundry not smelling as fresh as it should? You might think your washing machine is doing its job, but often, the problem lies within the machine itself. Over time, residue from detergents, fabric softeners, minerals from hard water, and even dirt from clothes build up. This grime creates a breeding ground for mold, mildew, and unpleasant odors inside your appliance.

Learning how to clean your washing machine inside is essential for truly fresh laundry. A dirty washing machine cannot properly clean your clothes. In fact, it can transfer dirt and odors back onto your garments. This guide will walk you through easy steps to deep clean your washing machine, covering different machine types and common problem areas. We will explore natural cleaning methods, discuss specific components, and provide tips to keep your machine sparkling clean. Get ready to enjoy laundry that smells truly fresh every time.

### Takeaway

Regularly cleaning your washing machine inside prevents odors and improves its performance.
*   Run hot cycles with vinegar or a commercial cleaner to sanitize the drum.
*   Pay special attention to the detergent dispenser and rubber gasket to remove hidden mold and grime.
*   Clean the drain pump filter and inspect the agitator or impeller for buildup.
*   Routine maintenance, like leaving the door ajar and using less detergent, extends the life of your machine.

To clean your washing machine inside, run an empty hot water cycle with two cups of white vinegar, followed by a second hot cycle with half a cup of baking soda. For specific areas, wipe down the drum, remove and scrub the detergent dispenser, and meticulously clean the rubber gasket to eliminate mold and residue. This process removes odors and ensures your clothes get a truly clean wash.

## Why Cleaning Your Washing Machine Inside Matters for Fresh Laundry

Your washing machine works hard to get your clothes clean, but it can also get dirty itself. Think about all the dirt, lint, detergent residue, and even skin cells that pass through it with every wash. Over time, these elements combine to form a murky buildup inside the drum, hoses, and dispensers. This residue is often dark and slimy.

This buildup creates a perfect environment for mold and mildew to grow. These fungi thrive in damp, dark places, and your washing machineâ€™s interior provides just that. Mold leads to musty odors that can transfer directly onto your freshly washed clothes. This means your laundry might smell worse coming out of the machine than it did going in. No one wants clothes that carry a damp, stale scent.

Beyond just smells, a dirty washing machine can impact its cleaning performance. When components like the detergent dispenser or drum are clogged with residue, water and detergent cannot flow effectively. This means your clothes might not get as clean as they should. You might notice visible spots on clothing or a general lack of freshness. A machine struggling with buildup also works less efficiently. It might use more energy or water to achieve the same level of clean, which costs you money.

Neglecting to clean your washing machine inside can also shorten its lifespan. Buildup can clog filters and hoses, putting strain on the motor and other parts. Mold can also degrade rubber seals and plastic components over time. Regular cleaning helps to prevent these issues, keeping your appliance running smoothly for years. It's a simple maintenance step that protects your investment and ensures your laundry truly gets clean. Keeping your machine clean helps ensure your clothes are always fresh and your appliance lasts longer.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Arsenal: Essential Supplies

Before you start the deep clean, gather all your supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smoother and more efficient. You likely have most of these items already in your home. We are aiming for effective, yet simple tools and cleaners.

First, you will need white distilled vinegar. This common household product is a cleaning powerhouse. Vinegar is acidic, which helps break down mineral deposits, soap scum, and neutralize odors. It also has natural disinfectant properties that help kill mold and bacteria. We use white vinegar because it is clear and will not stain your machine.

Next, grab some baking soda. This alkaline powder is excellent for absorbing odors and providing a gentle abrasive action. It works well with vinegar to create a cleaning reaction. The combination helps lift stubborn grime and freshens the interior of your machine. You will use it in conjunction with the vinegar for a thorough clean.

You will also need a few cleaning cloths or microfiber towels. These are perfect for wiping down surfaces, soaking up spills, and scrubbing away residue. Microfiber is particularly good at trapping dirt and lint. An old toothbrush or a small cleaning brush will be useful for reaching tight spots. These tools are perfect for scrubbing the detergent dispenser and the rubber gasket.

For tougher jobs, like significant mold or scum, consider a spray bottle for applying solutions directly. A bucket will be helpful for rinsing parts or catching water. Sometimes, a gentle all-purpose cleaner might be needed for the exterior, but our focus here is the inside. If you prefer commercial products, have your chosen washing machine cleaner on hand. Make sure to choose a cleaner specifically designed for washing machines.

Finally, wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from cleaning solutions and grime. Having these basic supplies on hand will set you up for success. You will be ready to tackle any dirt or odor inside your washing machine.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Clean Your Washing Machine Inside with Natural Solutions

Cleaning your washing machine inside using natural solutions like vinegar and baking soda is effective and gentle. This method helps remove soap scum, mineral deposits, and mold. It leaves your machine smelling fresh. We will cover steps for both front-loader and top-loader machines.

### Cleaning a Front-Loader Machine

Front-loading machines are popular for their efficiency, but their design can make them prone to mold and odor buildup. The rubber gasket around the door is a common trouble spot. Let's get started.

1.  **Prepare the Machine:** First, ensure your washing machine is completely empty. Remove any clothes or items from the drum. You do not want anything inside during this cleaning cycle.

2.  **Add Vinegar:** Pour two cups of white distilled vinegar directly into the detergent dispenser. If your dispenser has multiple compartments, put it in the main liquid detergent tray. Alternatively, you can pour it directly into the drum itself.

3.  **Run a Hot Cycle:** Close the dispenser drawer and the machine door. Select the hottest water setting available on your machine. Many front-loaders have a "Sanitize," "Tub Clean," or "Deep Clean" cycle specifically for this purpose. If yours does not, choose the hottest, longest wash cycle setting. Start the cycle. The hot water and vinegar will work together to dissolve mineral buildup and kill bacteria.

4.  **Add Baking Soda (Second Step):** Once the vinegar cycle finishes, leave the machine empty. Now, add half a cup of baking soda directly into the detergent dispenser. You can also sprinkle it directly into the drum.

5.  **Run a Second Hot Cycle:** Run another hot, empty wash cycle immediately after the vinegar cycle. The baking soda will help neutralize any lingering odors from the vinegar. It also provides an extra scrubbing action. This second cycle rinses away any loosened grime.

6.  **Wipe Down:** After both cycles, open the machine door. Use a clean cloth or sponge to wipe down the inside of the drum. Pay attention to any remaining residue. Wipe down the detergent dispenser and the rubber gasket thoroughly. We will cover the gasket in more detail later. This helps to dry the machine and remove any last bits of grime.

### Cleaning a Top-Loader Machine

Top-loading washing machines are generally easier to clean due to their open design, but they can still accumulate buildup. The agitator or impeller can collect debris.

1.  **Fill with Hot Water:** Make sure your machine is empty. Set your machine to its largest load size and hottest water setting. Start the cycle and let the drum fill completely with hot water. Do not add any detergent or clothes.

2.  **Add Vinegar:** Once the drum is full, pour two cups of white distilled vinegar directly into the water. Let the machine agitate for a minute or two to mix the vinegar.

3.  **Soak:** After the initial agitation, pause the wash cycle. Let the vinegar-water mixture sit and soak in the machine for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This soaking time allows the vinegar to break down soap scum, hard water deposits, and mildew.

4.  **Complete the Cycle:** After soaking, unpause the cycle and let the machine complete the full wash and rinse cycles. The hot water and vinegar will flush out the loosened grime. For a particularly dirty machine, you might notice dark flakes or residue in the water during draining.

5.  **Add Baking Soda (Second Step):** Once the first cycle finishes, set the machine for another full, hot water cycle. As it fills, add half a cup of baking soda directly to the water. Let it agitate and complete the cycle. The baking soda will absorb odors and give a final clean rinse.

6.  **Wipe Down:** When both cycles are done, use a clean cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum. Reach under the agitator or around the impeller if possible. Wipe the lid and edges. Ensure the machine is dry to prevent new mold growth. This simple process helps keep your top-loader fresh. For more specific top-loader cleaning information, refer to this guide on [how to clean washing machine top loader](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-top-loader).

## Tackling Specific Problem Areas Inside Your Washing Machine

While the vinegar and baking soda cycles clean the main drum, certain parts of your washing machine need direct attention. These areas are prone to collecting stubborn residue, mold, and even "scrud." Addressing these spots ensures a truly comprehensive clean. If you find your washing machine has a lot of grime, you might be dealing with [how to clean scrud from washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-scrud-from-washing-machine).

### The Detergent Dispenser Drawers

The detergent and fabric softener dispenser drawers are often overlooked. Soap residue, fabric softener goo, and water can combine to create a sticky, moldy mess in these compartments. This buildup can prevent new detergent from dispensing properly, leaving your clothes less clean. It also contributes to machine odors.

To clean these, first, pull the dispenser drawer out completely if your machine allows. Most modern machines have a release button or lever to do this. If it does not come out, clean it in place. Soak removable drawers in a sink filled with hot, soapy water for about 30 minutes. Use an old toothbrush or small brush to scrub away all visible grime and mold from every nook and cranny. Pay attention to the corners and crevices. Rinse the drawer thoroughly under running water until all residue is gone. For the housing where the drawer sits, use a damp cloth and the small brush to clean inside. Wipe down all surfaces.

### The Rubber Gasket/Door Seal (Front Loaders)

The rubber gasket, or door seal, on front-loading washing machines is notorious for collecting mold, mildew, and lint. Water often pools in its folds after a cycle, creating a damp environment. This area is a primary source of musty odors. You will often see black or dark brown mold growth here.

To clean the gasket, pull back the rubber folds. You will likely find lint, hair, and slimy residue. Use a clean cloth dampened with a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar. You can also use a mild bleach solution if mold is severe, but always test in an inconspicuous area first and ensure good ventilation. Wipe all around the inside and outside of the gasket. Use an old toothbrush or cotton swabs to reach into the tight crevices and under the rubber flaps. Scrub until all visible mold and grime are gone. After cleaning, wipe the gasket dry with a clean cloth. For a detailed guide on this crucial step, refer to [how to clean rubber gasket in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-rubber-gasket-in-washing-machine).

### The Drain Pump Filter (Front Loaders)

Many front-load machines have a drain pump filter, usually located at the bottom front of the machine behind a small access panel. This filter catches lint, small items (like coins or buttons), and other debris before they reach the drain pump. If clogged, it can cause drainage issues, leave clothes wet, and produce foul odors.

Before opening the filter, place a shallow pan or towel underneath it to catch any water. Unscrew or unclip the filter cover slowly, as some water will likely drain out. Pull out the filter and remove any lint, debris, or foreign objects. Rinse the filter under running water to clean it thoroughly. Use a small brush if needed. Also, inspect the housing where the filter sits for any remaining grime. Once clean, reinsert the filter and close the access panel tightly.

### The Agitator or Impeller (Top Loaders)

In top-loading machines, the central agitator or the bottom impeller (in high-efficiency models) can accumulate buildup. This includes soap scum, hard water minerals, and fabric softener residue. This buildup reduces the effectiveness of the wash cycle and can contribute to odors.

To clean the agitator, use a soft cloth dampened with a vinegar-water solution. Wipe down all visible surfaces of the agitator, including the top and sides. If possible, reach underneath the agitator base to clean any trapped grime. For machines with impellers, wipe down the low-profile cone or disc at the bottom of the tub. Pay attention to the grooves and ridges. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away any stubborn residue.

Ensuring these parts are clean helps ensure your clothes receive the best possible wash.

## Using Commercial Washing Machine Cleaners for a Deep Clean

While natural solutions like vinegar and baking soda are highly effective, commercial washing machine cleaners offer a convenient and powerful alternative. These products are specifically formulated to tackle the toughest grime, soap scum, mold, and odor-causing bacteria inside your appliance. They often contain strong descaling agents and disinfectants. Sometimes, you need something extra to cut through years of buildup.

Commercial cleaners come in various forms, including tablets, powders, or liquid solutions. Brands like Affresh, Washer Magic, and Tide Washing Machine Cleaner are popular choices. Each product has its own set of instructions, so it is important to read them carefully before use. Generally, the process is straightforward and follows a similar pattern to using natural solutions.

First, ensure your washing machine is completely empty. You do not want any laundry inside when using these powerful cleaners. Add the recommended amount of the commercial cleaner directly into the detergent dispenser or into the drum itself. Some tablets might be placed directly into the drum. Follow the product's dosage instructions precisely.

Next, select the hottest water setting on your washing machine. Many modern machines have a dedicated "Clean Washer" or "Tub Clean" cycle. If your machine has this feature, use it. This cycle is designed to use the hottest water and specific agitation patterns to maximize the cleaner's effectiveness. If your machine does not have a special cleaning cycle, choose the longest and hottest normal wash cycle. Start the cycle and let it run to completion.

Commercial cleaners work by circulating through the machine's components, dissolving built-up residue, killing bacteria, and rinsing away odors. You might see some foam or discoloration in the water during the cycle, which indicates the cleaner is working. After the cycle finishes, wipe down the interior of the drum and around the door seal. This removes any loosened particles or residual cleaner.

Commercial cleaners can be very effective for a deep clean, especially if your machine has not been cleaned in a while or has a persistent odor. They are a good option for periodic use, perhaps once every few months, in between your regular vinegar and baking soda cleans. Some people prefer them for their simplicity and targeted action against specific washing machine issues. If you are struggling with stubborn smells or visible grime, a commercial cleaner might be the solution you need.

## Addressing Stubborn Issues: Mold, Scrud, and Hard Water Buildup

Sometimes, basic cleaning is not enough for really stubborn problems. Mold, scrud, and hard water buildup are common culprits behind persistent odors and ineffective washing. Each of these issues requires a targeted approach to completely eliminate them from your washing machine. Dealing with mold can be especially tricky. For severe mold problems, it is crucial to understand [how to clean mold from washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing-machine) properly.

### Battling Persistent Mold

Mold thrives in dark, damp environments. The rubber gasket of front-loaders and any crevices where water lingers are prime spots. If you see black, slimy patches, you have mold.
*   **Bleach Solution:** For severe mold, a bleach solution can be effective. Mix 1/2 cup of bleach with 1 gallon of water. Dip a cloth into the solution and carefully wipe down all moldy areas. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Then, wipe thoroughly with a clean, damp cloth. Always ensure good ventilation when using bleach. Run an empty hot water rinse cycle afterward to flush out any bleach residue. If you want to use bleach for a full machine clean, this article explains [how to clean washing machine with bleach](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-bleach).
*   **Oxygen Bleach:** As an alternative to chlorine bleach, oxygen bleach (like OxiClean) can be safer for some machine parts and is effective at killing mold. Add a scoop of oxygen bleach to an empty hot water cycle, similar to how you would use baking soda.
*   **Professional Cleaners:** Some commercial mold removers are designed specifically for washing machines. Follow product instructions carefully.

### Eliminating Scrud

"Scrud" is a term for the waxy, greasy buildup of un-dissolved detergent, fabric softener, and body oils. It looks like white or grey flakes and often sticks to clothes or the inside of the drum. Scrud contributes significantly to odors.
*   **Hot Water and Detergent Cycle:** Run an empty cycle on the hottest setting with a good quality heavy-duty detergent (not your regular laundry detergent). This helps to break down the greasy components of scrud.
*   **Vinegar Soak:** Follow up with a hot cycle using two cups of white vinegar. The acid in vinegar is excellent for dissolving scrud. For top-loaders, let it soak for an hour before completing the cycle.
*   **Manual Scrubbing:** If scrud is visible on the drum or agitator, scrub it manually with a non-abrasive sponge and a vinegar solution.

### Removing Hard Water Buildup

Hard water contains high levels of minerals like calcium and magnesium. These minerals leave behind white, chalky deposits inside your washing machine. This buildup can clog hoses, reduce efficiency, and provide surfaces for mold to cling to.
*   **Vinegar is Key:** White vinegar is your best friend against hard water. Its acetic acid effectively dissolves mineral deposits. Use it regularly in your cleaning cycles.
*   **Citric Acid:** For very stubborn hard water stains, citric acid powder can be even more potent. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of citric acid powder directly into the empty drum and run the hottest, longest cycle. Citric acid is a strong descaler.
*   **Descaling Products:** There are commercial descaling products specifically designed for appliances. These are particularly useful if you live in an area with very hard water. Follow the product's instructions for use.
Regularly addressing these issues will prevent them from becoming overwhelming. A clean machine delivers clean laundry.

## Maintaining a Fresh Washing Machine: Best Practices for Prevention

Cleaning your washing machine inside is not just a one-time event. To keep your appliance performing its best and your laundry smelling fresh, regular maintenance is key. Implementing a few simple habits can prevent grime, mold, and odors from returning. These practices save you time and effort in the long run.

First, always leave the washing machine door or lid ajar after each wash cycle. This is especially important for front-loading machines, but beneficial for all types. By leaving the door open, you allow air to circulate inside the drum. This helps the interior dry out completely, which prevents mold and mildew from growing in the damp environment. A dry environment is a mold-free environment.

Second, use the correct amount of detergent. Many people tend to use too much detergent, thinking more soap means cleaner clothes. However, excess detergent does not fully rinse away. It leaves behind a residue inside your machine, contributing to soap scum and mold buildup. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for detergent dosage, considering your load size and water hardness. High-efficiency (HE) machines, in particular, require low-sudsing HE detergents and very little of it.

Consider using less fabric softener, or skip it entirely. Fabric softener is a major contributor to slimy residue inside the dispenser and drum. It can leave a waxy film that traps dirt and creates a breeding ground for bacteria. If you must use fabric softener, dilute it with water before adding it to the dispenser. Alternatives like white vinegar in the rinse cycle can soften clothes without leaving residue.

Another good practice is to remove wet laundry promptly after the cycle finishes. Leaving wet clothes sitting in the machine for extended periods creates a very humid environment. This encourages mold and mildew to grow both on your clothes and inside the machine. Get those clothes into the dryer or onto the line as soon as the cycle ends.

Finally, wipe down the drum and the door seal after every few washes. A quick wipe with a clean, dry cloth removes any lingering moisture, lint, or hair. For front-loaders, pay extra attention to drying the rubber gasket thoroughly. This simple step takes only a minute but makes a significant difference in preventing buildup. By incorporating these small habits into your laundry routine, you will keep your washing machine cleaner for longer. This ensures your clothes come out sparkling clean and fresh every single time.
