## What Mattress Will Medicare Pay For: Your Guide to Coverage

Finding the right mattress is key for comfort. But for some, it is about health. People often wonder: "What mattress will Medicare pay for?" I understand this concern. Many individuals need special mattresses due to health conditions. Standard beds do not offer the support required.

Medicare is a government health insurance program. It helps millions of Americans. This article helps you understand Medicare's rules for mattresses. We will discuss covered types, eligibility, and the steps to get approval. You will learn what Medicare can do for your specific needs. My aim is to make this process clear for you.

### Takeaway

Getting a mattress covered by Medicare involves specific steps. Here is what you need to know:
*   Medicare only covers medically necessary mattresses.
*   These are usually pressure-relieving or therapeutic mattresses.
*   You need a doctor's order.
*   The supplier must enroll with Medicare.
*   Part B generally covers these items as Durable Medical Equipment (DME).

Medicare may pay for certain types of mattresses. These are not standard mattresses for comfort. They are therapeutic mattresses or mattress overlays designed to prevent or treat medical conditions like pressure ulcers (bed sores). You need a doctor's order that proves medical necessity for coverage.

## Understanding Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and Mattresses

Medicare defines specific items as Durable Medical Equipment, or DME. This category includes medical devices used at home. DME helps with health conditions. It must be able to withstand repeated use. It must serve a medical purpose.

A mattress can sometimes fit into the DME category. This happens when it serves a medical purpose. For example, a pressure-relieving mattress can prevent bedsores. Such a mattress helps a patient's health directly. This is different from a regular mattress. A regular mattress is for general comfort.

Medicare Part B typically covers DME. This is the medical insurance part of Medicare. You pay a monthly premium for Part B. It covers doctor visits, outpatient care, and some medical equipment. If your doctor determines a special mattress is medically necessary, Part B may help pay for it.

The mattress must be for use in your home. It must also be prescribed by a doctor. The doctor needs to prove it is necessary for your medical condition. Without this proof, Medicare will not cover it. The supplier also must be Medicare-enrolled.

## Types of Mattresses Medicare May Cover

Medicare does not cover just any mattress. It focuses on specific types. These are designed for medical needs. They help manage health conditions. These special mattresses are often used with a hospital bed.

One common type is the pressure-relieving mattress. These mattresses aim to prevent or treat pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers, also called bed sores, can develop when someone stays in one position too long. Air mattresses are a type of pressure-relieving mattress. They use air cells that inflate and deflate. This shifts pressure points on the body. Knowing how to maintain these specialized items is important, and you can learn more about [how to clean an air mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-mattress) if you receive one.

Another covered type includes low air loss mattresses. These mattresses constantly move air across the skin. This keeps the skin dry. It also helps reduce friction. Foam mattresses with special designs also fit this category. These are not standard foam mattresses you might buy for comfort. They have specific densities and designs to distribute weight.

Mattress overlays are also possible for coverage. An overlay sits on top of an existing mattress. It adds a pressure-relieving layer. These can be gel, foam, or air-filled. For any medical mattress, maintaining hygiene is crucial. You might need to know [how to clean stains from a mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-from-a-mattress) or perform [how to deep clean your mattress](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-deep-clean-your-mattress) to ensure a healthy environment.

Medicare rarely covers a standard mattress. It sees standard mattresses as comfort items. Medical necessity is the key factor for coverage. The mattress must directly help treat or prevent a specific medical problem. Without a clear medical reason, Medicare will not pay.

## Eligibility Requirements for Medicare Mattress Coverage

Getting a mattress covered by Medicare is not automatic. You must meet specific requirements. These rules ensure that only medically necessary items receive coverage. Understanding these rules helps you prepare your request.

First, medical necessity is paramount. Your doctor must determine that a special mattress is necessary. This means your current mattress is not enough. It must be necessary to prevent or treat a severe medical condition. Common conditions include severe bed sores or a high risk of developing them. People who are bedridden or have severe mobility issues often qualify.

Second, you need a doctor's prescription or order. This written order specifies the type of mattress. It also states the medical reason for its need. The prescription acts as proof for Medicare. Without it, Medicare will not consider your request. Your doctor must be enrolled in Medicare.

Third, the mattress must be for use in your home. Medicare covers equipment used in a home setting. It does not cover mattresses for hospitals or nursing homes. The supplier of the mattress must also be enrolled in Medicare. This means they have an agreement with Medicare to accept assignments. They agree to Medicare's approved payment amount. You cannot buy a mattress from just any store.

Finally, you must have Medicare Part B coverage. Part B covers DME. You must also meet your Part B deductible. After that, Medicare generally pays 80% of the Medicare-approved amount. You are responsible for the remaining 20% co-insurance. You also typically pay for the Part B premium.

## The Process to Get a Medicare-Approved Mattress

The process to get a Medicare-approved mattress involves several steps. Following these steps helps ensure your claim gets approved. It begins with your doctor. I want to guide you through this journey.

First, visit your doctor. Explain your health condition and why you believe a special mattress is needed. Your doctor will assess your medical condition. They will determine if you have a qualifying diagnosis. This might include pressure ulcers, severe immobility, or other conditions. If your doctor agrees, they will write a prescription. This prescription must clearly state the medical necessity.

Second, find a Medicare-enrolled supplier. You cannot buy a mattress from any store. The supplier must have a contract with Medicare. They must accept Medicare assignment. This means they agree to the Medicare-approved cost. You can ask your doctor for recommendations. Medicare's website also has a supplier directory. Always confirm their Medicare enrollment status before ordering.

Third, the supplier will submit the claim to Medicare. They will include your doctor's order. Medicare will then review the claim. They check for medical necessity and eligibility. This review process can take some time. Be patient during this period.

If your claim is denied, you have the right to appeal. An appeal means you ask Medicare to reconsider. You can gather more medical information to support your case. Your doctor can also provide additional details. Understanding how to navigate potential denials is important. Do not give up if your first request is not approved.

## Medicare Part B vs. Medicare Advantage Plans for Mattresses

Understanding your specific Medicare plan is important. Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage Plans handle mattress coverage differently. Knowing the distinctions helps you plan. I want to clarify these differences for you.

Original Medicare includes Part A and Part B. Medicare Part B covers Durable Medical Equipment (DME). This is where a medically necessary mattress falls. If you have Original Medicare, Medicare Part B generally pays 80% of the Medicare-approved amount for the mattress. You will pay the remaining 20% as co-insurance. This is after you meet your yearly Part B deductible. There are no network restrictions with Original Medicare. You can choose any Medicare-enrolled supplier.

Medicare Advantage Plans are different. These are private insurance plans approved by Medicare. They offer the same benefits as Original Medicare. Many plans also offer extra benefits. This might include vision, dental, or prescription drug coverage. Medicare Advantage Plans must cover medically necessary DME. However, they may have different rules.

Medicare Advantage Plans often have network restrictions. This means you might need to use specific suppliers. These suppliers are within the plan's network. Your out-of-pocket costs might also vary. Some plans have different co-payments or co-insurance for DME. It is crucial to check your specific plan's benefits. Call your plan's member services number. Ask about their rules for therapeutic mattresses. They can tell you about network requirements and costs. They can also explain if rental or purchase options apply to your plan.

## What Medicare Will NOT Cover Regarding Mattresses

Medicare has strict rules about what it covers. It is just as important to know what Medicare will *not* cover. This avoids surprises and helps manage expectations. I want to ensure you understand these limitations.

Medicare will not cover a standard mattress. This includes any mattress bought for general comfort. If you want a new mattress simply because yours is old or uncomfortable, Medicare will not pay. This is true even if you are a senior or have general aches and pains. The mattress must be medically necessary for a specific condition. It must be a therapeutic or pressure-relieving type.

Medicare also does not cover mattress toppers for comfort. Many people buy toppers to make their bed softer or firmer. These are not considered DME. They do not treat a specific medical condition. If your doctor prescribes a medical mattress overlay, that might be covered. But a standard comfort topper is not.

Furthermore, Medicare generally does not pay for replacement mattresses due to wear and tear. If your current medical mattress breaks down from normal use, it is usually not covered for replacement. There might be exceptions if its medical function fails. However, regular upkeep and understanding [how to put on a mattress protector](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-on-a-mattress-protector) can extend the life of your covered mattress, helping to prevent damage.

Purchases from non-approved suppliers are never covered. You must use a supplier enrolled in Medicare. If you buy a medical mattress from a store that is not Medicare-approved, you will pay the full cost. Always verify the supplier's status before making a purchase. This step is critical for coverage.

## Maximizing Your Medicare Mattress Benefits

Understanding how to use your Medicare benefits effectively is important. This helps you get the necessary equipment without undue financial strain. I want to share tips to help you maximize your Medicare mattress benefits.

First, always start with your doctor. They are your primary advocate. Explain your symptoms and needs clearly. Your doctor must provide the medical justification. They will write the necessary prescription. If they do not see a clear medical need, Medicare will not cover the mattress. Make sure your doctor's notes support the request fully.

Second, choose your supplier wisely. As mentioned, the supplier must be Medicare-enrolled. They must accept Medicare assignment. This ensures they will bill Medicare directly. It also limits what they can charge you. Always ask if they accept Medicare assignment before moving forward. This simple question can save you money and headaches.

Third, understand your costs. Even with Medicare coverage, you will have out-of-pocket expenses. This includes your Part B deductible. After meeting the deductible, you typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. This is your co-insurance. Consider if a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan helps cover these costs. Medigap plans pay some of your out-of-pocket expenses for Original Medicare.

Finally, consider rental vs. purchase options. For some DME, Medicare may prefer rental over purchase. This happens especially if the need is temporary. Your doctor's order might specify rental. Or the supplier might offer both. Understand the terms for each option. Sometimes, it is more cost-effective to rent. Other times, purchasing makes more sense in the long run. Discuss these options with your supplier and doctor to make the best choice.

### What if Medicare denies my claim for a mattress?
