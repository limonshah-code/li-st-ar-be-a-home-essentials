## How to Fix Your Whirlpool Dishwasher When It Won't Drain

There is nothing quite as frustrating as opening your dishwasher after a cycle, expecting sparkling clean dishes, only to find a pool of dirty water at the bottom. This common household problem means your Whirlpool dishwasher did not drain properly. It can leave your kitchen sink full of dirty dishes and your temper rising.

Many people think a non-draining dishwasher means an expensive repair. This is not always the case. Often, simple clogs or minor issues stop your Whirlpool dishwasher from draining. You can fix many of these problems yourself with basic tools and a little patience. This guide will walk you through the most common reasons your dishwasher holds water. We will also provide clear, step-by-step solutions to get your Whirlpool appliance working correctly again. By the end, you will understand how to get Whirlpool dishwasher to drain, saving you time and money.

### Takeaway

*   Regularly clean the dishwasher filter to prevent clogs.
*   Inspect the drain hose and air gap for blockages or kinks.
*   Ensure the garbage disposal is clear if connected to the dishwasher.
*   Confirm the drain pump is working properly and free of debris.
*   Understand when to seek professional repair for persistent issues.

### Clear Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain

Most Whirlpool dishwasher drain issues stem from clogs in the filter, drain hose, or air gap. Clear these blockages first. Check the garbage disposal connection if applicable. A faulty drain pump can also stop draining. Inspect the pump impeller for obstructions.

### Understanding Your Whirlpool Dishwasher's Drainage System

Before you start fixing anything, it helps to understand how your Whirlpool dishwasher drains water. The process is straightforward but involves several components. Knowing these parts makes troubleshooting easier. I found that a basic understanding always helps when I tackle any home appliance repair.

First, dirty water from the wash cycle collects in the sump area at the bottom of the dishwasher. This water then flows through a filter system. The filter catches food particles and debris, stopping them from entering the drainage system. After filtration, a drain pump activates. This pump pushes the water out of the dishwasher.

The water then travels through a drain hose. This hose connects the dishwasher to either your kitchen sink's drain pipe or your garbage disposal unit. Some installations also include an air gap device on the countertop. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Each part needs to work correctly for effective drainage. If any part fails or gets clogged, your Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain. I always check these components systematically.

### First Steps to Fix a Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Issue

When you see standing water in your Whirlpool dishwasher, do not panic. Start with these simple, quick checks. Many draining problems have very easy solutions. This is where I always begin my troubleshooting process.

First, ensure the dishwasher door is latched completely. Sometimes, a loose latch prevents the cycle from finishing and draining. Next, check if the wash cycle completed fully. Interrupting a cycle can leave water inside. You can try running a short rinse cycle to see if it drains.

Examine the drain at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Remove the lower rack and any visible large food particles. Sometimes, a spoon or a small piece of plastic can block the drain opening. I have found surprising items in there before. Also, make sure the water shut-off valve under the sink is fully open. While this mainly affects filling, a partially closed valve could disrupt the entire cycle's timing, impacting draining. Sometimes, a dishwasher can drain even when not actively running a cycle, which might indicate a different kind of issue. You can learn more about this by reading [will dishwasher drain when not on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-dishwasher-drain-when-not-on).

#### Initial Power and Cycle Checks

*   **Door Latch:** Confirm the door clicks shut firmly. A loose latch signals the machine that the cycle is incomplete.
*   **Cycle Completion:** Allow the dishwasher to run a full cycle without interruption. Power interruptions can halt drainage.
*   **Rinse Cycle Test:** Run a quick rinse cycle. Observe if the dishwasher attempts to drain the water. This can help isolate if the drain pump is engaging.
*   **Water Shut-Off Valve:** Locate the hot water supply valve under the sink. Ensure it is fully open. This ensures proper water pressure for all cycle phases.

These initial checks cost nothing and often solve the problem quickly. They are the easiest fixes you can try before diving into more complex tasks. I always recommend these as a starting point.

### Cleaning the Filter and Sump for Proper Whirlpool Drainage

The filter system is a common culprit for Whirlpool dishwasher draining problems. Food particles, grease, and debris accumulate here over time. This build-up blocks water flow and prevents proper drainage. Cleaning the filter regularly is key to preventing issues. I make it a part of my routine cleaning.

Most Whirlpool dishwashers have a removable filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. It usually consists of a coarse filter and a fine filter. You can access these by removing the lower dish rack. Twist or pull the filter components out according to your model's manual.

Once removed, rinse the filters thoroughly under hot running water. Use a soft brush or sponge to scrub away stubborn food residue. You might be surprised by how much gunk builds up. I often use a little dish soap to cut through grease. Pay attention to the small holes in the filter screens. Ensure they are clear of any blockages. Reinstall the filters correctly after cleaning. This simple maintenance step makes a huge difference.

#### Step-by-Step Filter Cleaning

1.  **Remove Lower Rack:** Pull out the bottom dish rack to access the dishwasher floor.
2.  **Locate Filter:** Find the cylindrical or flat filter screen in the center or back of the sump area.
3.  **Disassemble Filter:** Twist and lift the filter assembly parts. Refer to your Whirlpool owner's manual for specific instructions. There are usually two parts: a coarse screen and a fine micro-filter.
4.  **Rinse and Scrub:** Take the filter parts to the sink. Rinse them under hot water to remove loose debris. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away stuck-on food and grease.
5.  **Clean Sump Area:** While the filters are out, wipe down the sump area. This is the basin where water collects. Remove any visible debris from this area.
6.  **Reassemble and Replace:** Ensure all filter parts are clean and dry. Reinstall them carefully, making sure they click securely into place. They must form a tight seal to prevent debris from reaching the drain pump.

This cleaning should be done monthly, or more often if you frequently wash heavily soiled dishes. A clean filter ensures smooth water flow and prevents drain blockages. It is a vital step in maintaining your dishwasher's performance.

### Clearing Drain Hose and Air Gap Blockages in Your Whirlpool

After checking the filter, the drain hose and air gap are the next places to investigate. These components are external to the main wash tub but are critical for proper drainage. Blockages here are very common reasons why your Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain. I have found many clogs in these areas myself.

The drain hose connects your dishwasher to your household plumbing. It can get kinked, twisted, or clogged with grease and food debris. First, pull the dishwasher out slightly if possible to inspect the hose behind it. Look for any visible kinks or sharp bends in the hose. Straighten them out gently.

If no kinks are present, the hose might be clogged internally. You will need to disconnect the hose from both the dishwasher and the sink/garbage disposal connection. Have a bucket ready, as water will likely spill. Clear any visible debris from the hose ends. You can try flushing water through the hose or using a long brush to dislodge blockages.

#### Inspecting the Air Gap

Many Whirlpool dishwashers, especially older models, have an air gap. This is a small cylindrical device on your countertop, near the faucet. It helps prevent dirty water backflow. If your air gap is clogged, the dishwasher cannot drain properly.

To check the air gap:
1.  Remove the chrome cap and the inner plastic cap.
2.  Inspect the small hose connections inside for debris.
3.  Use a thin wire or screwdriver to clear any blockages.
4.  Reassemble the air gap securely.

A clogged air gap is often an easy fix. If you are not sure if your dishwasher can drain without it, it's worth checking this component. Sometimes, the issue lies not with the dishwasher itself, but with external plumbing connections. I always consider the entire drain path. This includes thinking about whether the dishwasher can drain when it's not on a cycle, which can point to issues beyond the pump. For more information, you can read about [will dishwasher drain when not on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-dishwasher-drain-when-not-on).

#### Steps to Check and Clear the Drain Hose and Air Gap

*   **Inspect Drain Hose for Kinks:** Gently pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet. Visually inspect the entire length of the corrugated drain hose. Ensure there are no sharp bends or kinks that restrict water flow.
*   **Disconnect and Clean Drain Hose:**
    *   Turn off power to the dishwasher at the circuit breaker.
    *   Place a shallow pan or towels under the connections.
    *   Disconnect the drain hose from the garbage disposal or sink drain.
    *   Disconnect the hose from the dishwasher's drain pump (often with a clamp).
    *   Visually inspect inside the hose for blockages. Use a stiff wire or a specialized drain brush to clear any clogs.
    *   You can also try running water through the hose in the opposite direction to flush it out.
*   **Clear the Air Gap:**
    *   Remove the decorative cap and inner plastic cover from the air gap on your countertop.
    *   Check for any visible food particles or debris clogging the ports.
    *   Use a small brush or a toothpick to clear any blockages.
    *   Ensure the hoses connected to the air gap are clear.
    *   Reassemble the air gap once clean.

Ensuring these external parts are free from obstructions is vital. They are often overlooked but cause significant draining issues.

### Addressing Garbage Disposal and Drain Line Connections

Many Whirlpool dishwashers connect to a garbage disposal unit. If your dishwasher drains into the disposal, a blockage in the disposal is a very common reason for drainage issues. I often find this to be the problem in homes with disposals. The drain line on the main sink can also become clogged, impacting the dishwasher.

First, run your garbage disposal with cold water for at least 30 seconds. This helps clear any food trapped inside. If the disposal itself is humming but not grinding, it may be jammed. Use an Allen wrench (usually provided with the disposal) to manually turn the motor from the bottom. This can free up the impellers. Never put your hand inside the disposal.

Next, check the knock-out plug in the garbage disposal if you recently installed a new one. New disposals come with a plug in the dishwasher inlet port. If this plug was not removed during installation, your dishwasher will never drain. I have seen this mistake happen many times. This applies only to new installations.

Finally, consider a clog in your main sink's drain line. If your sink drains slowly or is completely backed up, the dishwasher will not be able to push its water into the system. Try using a plunger on your sink or a commercial drain cleaner (if safe for your pipes) to clear the main drain. Sometimes, the problem is not with the dishwasher at all. This is a good example of why a dishwasher might drain differently even when it's not on. Knowing how external factors affect drainage is important. You can find more details on this by checking out [will dishwasher drain when not on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-dishwasher-drain-when-not-on).

#### Checking and Clearing Disposal and Drain Line

*   **Run Garbage Disposal:** Turn on the garbage disposal with cold water for a minute. This clears any food debris that could be blocking the dishwasher's drain connection.
*   **Check for Knock-Out Plug:** If the garbage disposal is new, verify that the knock-out plug was removed from the dishwasher inlet port during installation. This plug is factory-installed and must be removed for the dishwasher to drain.
*   **Inspect Disposal's Dishwasher Inlet:** Disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Check the inlet port on the disposal for any visible clogs or buildup. Clear any obstructions with a screwdriver or pliers.
*   **Assess Sink Drain:** Observe if your kitchen sink drains slowly or is completely backed up. If so, the issue is likely a main drain line clog. Address this with a plunger or a drain snake before retesting the dishwasher.
*   **Tighten Connections:** Ensure all hose clamps at the garbage disposal connection are secure. Loose clamps can cause air leaks, affecting drainage efficiency.

Addressing these connections ensures that the dishwasher's water has a clear path to exit your home's plumbing system. This is a frequent point of failure for non-draining dishwashers.

### Diagnosing and Fixing a Faulty Whirlpool Drain Pump

If you have checked all the simpler issues—filter, hose, air gap, and garbage disposal—and your Whirlpool dishwasher still will not drain, the problem might be with the drain pump. The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the dishwasher. If it fails, water stays in the tub. This is a more involved repair, but often DIY-friendly.

First, listen carefully during the drain cycle. Do you hear a humming sound from the dishwasher but no water movement? This often means the pump motor is running, but something blocks the impeller. The impeller is a small fan-like part that pushes the water. A piece of glass, a bone, or even a twisted zip tie can jam it. If you hear nothing, the pump motor might be dead.

To access the drain pump, you usually need to remove the lower spray arm and possibly the sump cover inside the dishwasher. Some models might require tilting the dishwasher or removing a lower access panel from the front. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before attempting this. Once you access the pump, inspect the impeller for obstructions. Clear any debris you find. If the impeller spins freely and the pump still does not work, the pump motor may need replacement. This is where I decide if I am comfortable replacing the part myself.

#### Steps to Inspect and Potentially Replace the Drain Pump

1.  **Disconnect Power:** Turn off the circuit breaker that supplies power to your dishwasher. This is a critical safety step.
2.  **Empty Dishwasher:** Remove all dishes and standing water from the tub. You might need to use a cup or towels for this.
3.  **Access the Pump:** This step varies by model.
    *   **From Inside the Tub:** Remove the lower spray arm and the filter assembly. You might need to unclip or unscrew a cover to see the pump housing at the bottom of the sump.
    *   **From Underneath:** Some Whirlpool models require you to pull the dishwasher out and tilt it on its back. Or, you might remove a lower access panel at the front.
4.  **Inspect Impeller:** Once you have access to the drain pump, look for the impeller. It is usually a small plastic fan-like component. Check for any foreign objects, like glass shards, food debris, or plastic pieces, jamming it. Use needle-nose pliers or your fingers to carefully remove any obstructions.
5.  **Test for Free Movement:** Try to spin the impeller manually. It should spin freely without resistance. If it feels stiff or does not move, it might still be jammed or the pump is failing.
6.  **Check Electrical Connections:** Ensure the wiring harness to the drain pump is securely connected. Loose wires can prevent the pump from receiving power.
7.  **Consider Replacement:** If the impeller is clear and spins freely, but the pump still does not operate (no humming, no water movement), the drain pump motor is likely faulty. You can order a replacement part specific to your Whirlpool model. Replacing the pump typically involves disconnecting wiring and hoses, then mounting the new unit. If you are uncertain about this, professional help is wise.

Remember, a non-working drain pump means the dishwasher cannot complete its cycle. This is a common part to fail over time due to wear or foreign object damage. Knowing whether your dishwasher drains even when not running a cycle can sometimes provide clues about the drain pump's state. For instance, if it always has water, even without running, the check valve or pump might be stuck open. You can investigate more on [will dishwasher drain when not on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-dishwasher-drain-when-not-on).

### Checking the Drain Valve and Sump Area for Blockages

Beyond the pump and filter, the drain valve and the sump area itself can cause draining issues. These components are less frequently problematic but are worth checking if other solutions fail. The drain valve controls water flow out of the sump into the drain hose. The sump is the basin at the bottom of the dishwasher where water collects.

The drain valve, also known as a check valve, is typically located near the drain pump. Its purpose is to allow water to flow out but prevent it from flowing back in. Over time, this valve can get stuck open or closed, or debris can jam it. A stuck-closed valve prevents drainage. A stuck-open valve can cause backflow, making it seem like the dishwasher never fully drains.

To inspect the drain valve, you usually need to remove the filter and possibly the lower spray arm. Look for a small rubber flapper or a spring-loaded mechanism near the drain pump housing. Ensure it moves freely and is not obstructed by food particles or foreign objects. Clear any debris with tweezers or pliers. If the valve itself appears damaged or corroded, it might need replacement. This part is often integrated with the pump or sump, so replacement can be a bit more complex.

#### Sump Area Inspection

The sump area is the lowest point inside your dishwasher. Even with the filter in place, small debris can sometimes bypass it and accumulate in the sump. This debris can then interfere with the drain pump's operation or block the check valve. I always do a thorough visual check of this area.

*   **Remove Filters and Spray Arm:** To get a clear view, remove the lower spray arm and the entire filter assembly.
*   **Visually Inspect:** Use a flashlight to look deep into the sump. Check for any food particles, broken glass, small bones, or plastic items that might have settled there. These items can impede the drain pump or block the valve.
*   **Manual Debris Removal:** Carefully reach in and remove any visible debris. Use gloves to protect your hands. A wet/dry vacuum can also be effective for removing standing water and small debris from the sump.
*   **Check for Cracks/Damage:** While inspecting, also look for any cracks or damage to the plastic sump basin itself. Though rare, a damaged sump could potentially affect drainage or lead to leaks.

A clean sump and a properly functioning drain valve ensure a clear path for water to leave the dishwasher. Do not overlook these areas when troubleshooting a persistent draining problem.

### When to Seek Professional Service for Your Whirlpool Dishwasher

You have tried everything. You cleaned the filter, cleared the hose, checked the air gap, confirmed the garbage disposal, and even inspected the drain pump and sump. Yet, your Whirlpool dishwasher still will not drain. At this point, it is okay to call for professional help. Some problems are simply beyond the scope of DIY repairs. I know my limits, and sometimes calling an expert saves more time and frustration.

A professional appliance technician has specialized tools and diagnostic equipment. They can quickly identify complex issues that are hard for the average homeowner to find. This could include:

*   **Control Board Issues:** The main control board might not be sending the correct signals to the drain pump. This is a complex electronic repair.
*   **Faulty Wiring:** Damaged or loose wiring within the dishwasher could prevent the pump from getting power.
*   **Advanced Pump Failure:** Sometimes the pump motor fails in a way that is not obvious. A technician can test the motor directly.
*   **Internal Plumbing Issues:** Very deep clogs in your house's main drain line might require a plumber rather than an appliance technician.

Before calling, have your dishwasher's model number ready. Also, describe the symptoms clearly and list all the troubleshooting steps you have already taken. This information helps the technician diagnose the problem more efficiently. Investing in a professional repair can extend the life of your appliance. It also gives you peace of mind that the job is done right.

#### When Professional Help is Essential

*   **No Power to Pump:** If you have tested the pump and confirmed it receives no power, even with all connections secure, a control board or wiring issue is likely.
*   **Persistent Clogs:** If the drain hose or main drain line repeatedly clogs despite your best efforts, there might be a larger plumbing problem.
*   **Unusual Noises:** Grinding, squealing, or loud humming from the pump area that does not stop after clearing debris suggests internal pump damage.
*   **Error Codes:** If your Whirlpool dishwasher displays specific error codes related to draining, these often point to component failures that need expert diagnosis.
*   **Lack of Confidence:** If you are uncomfortable with the more advanced steps, such as disconnecting electrical components or disassembling internal parts, a professional ensures safety and proper repair.

A professional can diagnose complex electrical issues or deep-seated clogs. They can also perform repairs that require specific tools or expertise. Do not hesitate to call a certified Whirlpool technician. It ensures your dishwasher operates efficiently and safely for years to come.
