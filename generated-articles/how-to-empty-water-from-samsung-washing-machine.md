### Understanding Why Your Samsung Washing Machine Has Standing Water

It is crucial to understand why your Samsung washing machine holds water. Several issues can cause this problem. Identifying the cause helps you fix it effectively. A common reason is a clogged drain pump filter.

This filter traps lint, coins, and small items that accidentally fall into the wash. When it clogs, water cannot pass through to the drain pump. Another frequent culprit is a kinked or blocked drain hose. The hose carries water away from the machine. If it bends sharply or has an obstruction, water flow stops.

Sometimes, the drain pump itself might be faulty. The pump is responsible for forcing water out of the machine. If it fails, water simply sits inside the drum. Electrical malfunctions or control board issues can also prevent the drain cycle from activating. Knowing these potential causes helps you approach troubleshooting systematically.

### Essential Safety Precautions Before You Start Draining Water

Safety comes first when dealing with any appliance repair. Your Samsung washing machine uses both electricity and water. These two elements can be dangerous together. I always start by unplugging the machine from its power source.

This step prevents electrical shock. Next, I turn off the water supply valves connected to the washing machine. These are usually located behind the machine. You will see two hoses connected to the wall; turn their respective valves clockwise until they are tight. This stops more water from entering the machine.

Prepare your workspace by laying down old towels or blankets. Draining water can be messy, even with careful planning. Have a shallow pan or bucket ready to catch the water. I often use a cookie sheet with raised edges or a small baking pan. This preparation helps contain spills and protects your floor from water damage. Safety ensures a smooth repair process.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Manually Empty Water From a Samsung Washing Machine (Front-Load)

Manually draining a front-load Samsung washing machine requires careful steps. This method is effective when the machine won't drain on its own. It is a bit messy, so be prepared. Most front-loaders have a small access panel at the bottom front. This panel hides the drain pump filter and a small emergency drain hose.

1.  **Locate the Access Panel:** Find the small door or panel at the bottom front of your Samsung washing machine. It usually snaps open or can be pried open gently.
2.  **Prepare for Water:** Place a large, shallow pan directly under the panel opening. Have plenty of towels ready. You will encounter quite a bit of water.
3.  **Access the Emergency Drain Hose:** Pull out the small, usually clear or white, emergency drain hose. It often has a cap or plug at its end.
4.  **Drain the Water:** Hold the hose over your pan and uncap it. Water will start flowing out. You might need to repeatedly drain small amounts, re-capping and emptying your pan until all water is out.
5.  **Remove the Drain Pump Filter:** Once the water stops flowing from the emergency hose, you can unscrew the drain pump filter. Turn it counter-clockwise. Be aware, a small amount of residual water might still come out.
6.  **Clean the Filter:** Remove any lint, coins, or debris from the filter. Inspect the filter housing for blockages as well. For a detailed guide on cleaning, refer to [how to clean Samsung washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-samsung-washing machine-filter).
7.  **Reassemble:** Screw the drain pump filter back in securely. Cap the emergency drain hose and place it back. Close the access panel.

After these steps, plug in the machine and turn on the water supply. Run a quick rinse and spin cycle to test if the drainage issue is resolved. This process is how I tackle stubborn standing water.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Manually Empty Water From a Samsung Washing Machine (Top-Load)

Draining a top-load Samsung washing machine can be different from a front-loader. Top-load machines usually do not have the convenient front access panel for a drain pump filter. The primary method often involves the drain hose at the back. This can be more challenging due to the machine's weight and connections.

1.  **Unplug and Turn Off Water:** As always, ensure the machine is unplugged and the water supply valves are closed. Safety first, every time.
2.  **Access the Drain Hose:** Carefully pull the washing machine away from the wall. Locate the large drain hose connected to the back of the machine. This hose usually empties into a utility sink or a standpipe.
3.  **Lower the Drain Hose:** This is a critical step for siphoning. Lower the end of the drain hose below the water level in the drum. Gravity will help the water flow out.
4.  **Prepare for Water Collection:** Place a large bucket or tub on the floor. Position the drain hose directly into this container.
5.  **Initiate Siphoning:** Remove the drain hose from the standpipe or utility sink. The water should start flowing out by gravity if the hose end is below the water level in the drum. If it does not, you might need to lower it further or gently shake the hose to initiate the flow.
6.  **Monitor and Empty:** Watch the water level in your bucket. Empty the bucket as it fills to prevent overflow. Continue until all the water drains from the machine.
7.  **Inspect for Kinks:** While the machine is pulled out, check the drain hose for any kinks or blockages. Straighten any kinks you find.
8.  **Consider the Drain Pump (Advanced):** If the siphoning method does not work, the drain pump might be completely blocked or failed. Accessing the drain pump on a top-load Samsung often involves tilting the machine back or even laying it on its side, which can be difficult and requires assistance. This step should only be attempted if you are comfortable with more advanced appliance work.
9.  **Reassemble:** Once empty, reattach the drain hose securely to its standpipe or utility sink. Push the washing machine back into place. Restore power and water supply.

### Clearing the Drain Pump Filter: A Common Solution

A clogged drain pump filter is the most common reason for standing water. Lint, pet hair, small clothing items, and even forgotten coins can accumulate here. Cleaning this filter is often the solution to your drainage problems. I always make this my first troubleshooting step.

The drain pump filter is designed to protect the drain pump. It stops debris from reaching the pump's impeller. Over time, this filter collects many things. When it becomes too full, water cannot pass through it effectively. This causes the machine to stop mid-cycle or leave water in the drum.

Accessing and cleaning the filter is straightforward. As mentioned in the front-load draining steps, it is usually behind a small panel at the bottom front. After draining the water with the emergency hose, unscrew the filter. You will likely find a surprising amount of gunk. Rinse the filter under running water. Remove any solid objects by hand. I use an old toothbrush to scrub away stubborn residue. Ensuring this filter is clean helps your Samsung washing machine drain properly. Regularly cleaning this filter can prevent many future drainage issues.

### Checking and Clearing the Drain Hose for Blockages

Beyond the drain pump filter, the drain hose is another critical component for water removal. A blockage or kink in this hose can also prevent proper drainage. The drain hose carries water from the washing machine to your home's drain system. If water cannot exit through the hose, it stays in the drum.

First, visually inspect the drain hose for kinks. If your machine is pushed too close to a wall, the hose can bend sharply. This restricts water flow. Gently pull the machine out and straighten any bends you see. Ensure the hose has a gradual curve. Also, confirm the hose is not pushed too far into the standpipe or utility sink. This can create a siphon lock, preventing drainage. The hose should have an air gap.

If there is no obvious kink, a blockage might be inside the hose. Detach the drain hose from both the washing machine and the standpipe/sink. I usually lay it flat on the floor or in a large tub. Then, run water through it from a faucet. If water struggles to pass, you have an internal blockage. You can try flushing it with high-pressure water. Alternatively, use a long, flexible brush (like a plumbing snake) to clear any debris. Reattach the hose securely once clear. This check is a simple yet effective way to troubleshoot drainage issues.

### Troubleshooting the Drain Pump and Other Electrical Issues

Sometimes, the problem is more severe than a clogged filter or kinked hose. The drain pump itself might be faulty. The drain pump makes a distinct humming noise when it operates. If you do not hear this sound during a drain cycle, the pump might not be working. A faulty pump cannot push water out of the drum.

Before assuming the pump is broken, consider a machine reset. Sometimes, a software glitch can prevent the pump from activating. Unplug the machine for 5-10 minutes. Then plug it back in. This often resets the internal computer. You can also explore [how to reset Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-reset-samsung-washing-machine) for detailed steps on resetting your particular model. After a reset, try running a spin cycle to see if the water drains.

If a reset does not help, and you suspect the drain pump, further investigation is needed. Accessing the drain pump often requires removing the back or front panel of the machine. This can involve specialized tools and electrical knowledge. If you are not comfortable with this, it is best to call a qualified appliance technician. A professional can diagnose if the pump needs cleaning, repair, or replacement. They can also check for wiring issues or control board failures, which can also affect drainage.

### Preventing Future Drainage Problems in Your Samsung Washing Machine

Preventing future drainage issues saves you time and frustration. Regular maintenance is key. I make it a point to perform simple checks often. These small efforts extend the life of your appliance. They also keep your laundry routine running smoothly.

One of the most important preventative steps is regular drain pump filter cleaning. I recommend cleaning this filter every few months. If you wash a lot of pet hair or heavily soiled items, clean it more often. This stops lint and debris from building up. A clean filter ensures smooth water flow. You can find your filter easily. For more details on locating this component, consider checking [where is the filter on a Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-filter-on-a-samsung-washing-machine).

Always check pockets before washing clothes. Small items like coins, keys, or tissues can easily cause clogs. These objects can get past the filter and damage the pump. Using mesh laundry bags for small or delicate items can also help. This prevents them from escaping into the machine's drainage system. Lastly, ensure your drain hose is not kinked. Regularly pull out the machine to check the hose's condition. These simple practices significantly reduce the risk of future drainage problems.
