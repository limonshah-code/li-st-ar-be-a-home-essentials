Imagine a fresh, hot pizza, perfectly crisp, with gooey cheese, ready in minutes right in your kitchen. This is not a dream. You can easily achieve this using a convection microwave and a readymade pizza base. It is a game-changer for quick meals and satisfying cravings. I found this method delivers impressive results, making pizza night simple and convenient.

This guide helps you understand how to make pizza in a convection microwave with a readymade pizza base. We will cover selecting ingredients, preparing your base, assembling toppings, and mastering the convection settings. You will learn the exact steps to get a delicious pizza every time. Let us make homemade pizza a regular, enjoyable event.

### Takeaway

*   Use a convection microwave to bake pizza quickly and efficiently.
*   Preheat your microwave to the correct temperature for even cooking.
*   Prick the readymade pizza base to prevent bubbling for a crispier crust.
*   Do not overload toppings to ensure proper cooking and a non-soggy pizza.
*   Always use a microwave-safe metal rack for best convection results.

To make pizza in a convection microwave with a readymade pizza base, preheat the microwave in convection mode to 200°C (390°F). Prepare the base by pricking it and adding sauce, cheese, and desired toppings. Place the pizza on the high metal rack and bake for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden and cheese melts.

### Why Choose a Convection Microwave for Pizza?

Convection microwaves are a fantastic tool for making pizza. They combine the speed of a microwave with the browning and crisping power of a conventional oven. This dual functionality means your pizza cooks faster and achieves a satisfyingly crisp crust. Unlike traditional microwaves, a convection microwave uses a fan to circulate hot air. This circulating hot air bakes food evenly from all sides.

The key difference lies in how they cook. A regular microwave uses microwaves to heat water molecules in food, which often results in soggy textures. However, a convection oven uses heating elements and a fan to mimic a conventional oven. This ensures your readymade pizza base gets properly baked and crispy. I personally found my pizza crusts transformed after I started using my convection microwave. This method is much better than trying to make pizza in a standard microwave, which usually yields a chewy and soft base.

The uniform heat distribution of a convection microwave is ideal for baking. It allows the cheese to melt perfectly and the toppings to cook through without burning. This is crucial for a well-made pizza. You get the benefits of an oven without needing to heat up your entire kitchen. Understanding [how a convection oven cooks differently](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-does-convection-oven-cook-differently) helps you appreciate its advantages for baking. It is a smart choice for anyone seeking efficiency and quality in their kitchen.

The convenience factor is also a major plus. You can bake a pizza in half the time it might take in a traditional oven. This makes it perfect for busy weeknights or unexpected cravings. For a quick and delicious pizza, a convection microwave is truly indispensable. It provides that much-desired crispness and even baking.

### Essential Ingredients and Tools for Your Pizza

Starting with the right ingredients and tools makes all the difference. For a delicious pizza in your convection microwave, gather a few basic items. The star of the show is, of course, the readymade pizza base. These bases come in various sizes and thicknesses, so choose one that fits your preference and your microwave’s capacity. A good quality base sets the foundation for your pizza.

Next, you need your pizza sauce. You can use a store-bought marinara or make your own for a fresh taste. The sauce provides moisture and flavor. Then comes the cheese. Mozzarella is the classic choice for its meltiness, but you can mix it with cheddar or provolone for added flavor. I always recommend grating your own cheese, as pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can hinder a smooth melt.

For toppings, the possibilities are endless. Consider pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, or cooked chicken. Make sure your toppings are cut into small, manageable pieces. This helps them cook thoroughly and evenly. Avoid using too many wet toppings, as they can make your crust soggy.

You also need a few essential tools. A round, microwave-safe metal baking tray or the high rack that comes with your convection microwave is crucial. This rack allows hot air to circulate under the pizza base. You will also need a spatula or pizza peel for easy removal. A pizza cutter simplifies slicing your finished pizza. Remember to keep your [pizza pan clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-pizza-pan) for best results. Having all your ingredients and tools ready before you start saves time and makes the process smooth.

### Prepping Your Readymade Pizza Base

Proper preparation of your readymade pizza base is key to a great pizza. This step helps ensure a crispy crust and prevents common issues like bubbling or a soggy base. First, unwrap your pizza base and place it on a clean surface. Many readymade bases are somewhat soft. Prick the entire surface of the base with a fork multiple times. This simple action allows steam to escape during cooking. If you skip this step, air bubbles can form under the crust, making it uneven and potentially soggy.

After pricking, you can optionally brush a very thin layer of olive oil on the edges of the base. This helps create a golden, crisp crust, giving it a more homemade feel. Be careful not to use too much oil; a light brush is enough. This step enhances the texture and adds a touch of flavor. It also prevents the edges from drying out too much.

Next, apply your pizza sauce. Use a spoon or the back of a ladle to spread the sauce evenly across the base, leaving a small border around the edge for the crust. Do not overload with sauce. Too much sauce can make the base soggy and prevent it from crisping up. A thin, even layer is perfect. I have found that a moderate amount of sauce allows the other flavors to shine without overpowering the pizza.

Some people prefer to pre-bake the base for a few minutes before adding toppings. This can result in an extra crispy crust, especially if your readymade base is thick. If you choose this, bake the pricked base in the convection microwave at 200°C (390°F) for 3-5 minutes until slightly firm. Then, remove it and proceed with adding toppings. This pre-baking step is optional but highly recommended for those who love a truly firm and crispy crust.

### Assembling Your Perfect Pizza

Assembling your pizza is where your creativity comes alive. After preparing your readymade pizza base, it is time to layer on the deliciousness. Start with your cheese. Sprinkle a generous, even layer of mozzarella or your preferred cheese directly over the sauce. Make sure the cheese covers most of the sauced area. This forms the base for your toppings and ensures a gooey, melted texture. Do not go too close to the edge; leave about half an inch for the crust.

Next, add your chosen toppings. Distribute them evenly across the cheese layer. Do not overload the pizza. Overloading can lead to several problems:
*   **Uneven cooking:** Some toppings might cook well, while others remain raw.
*   **Soggy crust:** Too many toppings release moisture, making the base soft.
*   **Sliding toppings:** When you slice the pizza, toppings might fall off.
*   **Increased cooking time:** A heavily loaded pizza takes longer to cook, risking a burnt crust or overcooked cheese.

For meats like pepperoni or cooked chicken, arrange them in a single layer. For vegetables, spread them out so hot air can circulate around them. If using fresh vegetables, ensure they are thinly sliced. This helps them cook through during the short baking time. I always prefer to chop my vegetables finely. This ensures they cook evenly and integrate well with the other ingredients.

Once the toppings are on, you can add another light sprinkle of cheese. This top layer of cheese helps to hold the toppings in place and creates a beautiful golden-brown finish. This second layer of cheese also creates a delicious cheesy crust on top of your toppings. Avoid piling the cheese too high. A balanced approach ensures everything cooks properly and tastes fantastic. Your pizza is now ready for the convection microwave.

### Convection Microwave Settings for Pizza Perfection

Getting the right settings on your convection microwave is critical for a perfectly baked pizza. Most convection microwaves have a dedicated convection mode that mimics a traditional oven. The first and most important step is to preheat your microwave. Set your convection microwave to convection mode and choose a temperature of 200°C (390°F). Allow it to preheat for at least 10-15 minutes. Preheating ensures the cooking cavity is uniformly hot, which is essential for a crisp crust.

Always use the metal rack that comes with your convection microwave. This rack elevates the pizza, allowing hot air to circulate completely around the base and toppings. Placing the pizza directly on the turntable can block air flow and result in an unevenly cooked or soggy bottom. The metal rack is designed to work with the convection function. It helps achieve that desired crispy base.

The cooking time will vary depending on your microwave’s wattage, the thickness of your pizza base, and the amount of toppings. A general guideline for a readymade pizza base is 10-15 minutes. Start checking your pizza after 10 minutes. Look for a golden-brown crust and bubbling, melted cheese. If the cheese is melting but the crust needs more browning, you can cook it for a few more minutes.

Some convection microwaves have specific "pizza" presets. While these can be convenient, I often find manual convection mode settings offer more control. Manual mode allows you to adjust temperature and time precisely. If your pizza seems to be cooking too fast or too slow, adjust the time in small increments. For example, if the crust is browning too quickly, you might slightly lower the temperature. Regularly cleaning your [convection oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-convection-oven) also ensures optimal performance and even cooking.

### Step-by-Step Cooking Process

Once your convection microwave is preheated and your pizza is assembled, it is time to cook. This step-by-step process ensures you get a perfectly baked pizza every time. First, carefully place your assembled pizza onto the metal rack provided with your convection microwave. Ensure the pizza is centered on the rack for even heat distribution.

Next, open your preheated convection microwave door. Carefully slide the metal rack with the pizza into the microwave. Position it in the center of the microwave cavity. Close the door firmly. Avoid opening the door too frequently during cooking, as this lets heat escape and extends cooking time.

Set the timer for 10 minutes. Begin cooking your pizza in the convection mode at 200°C (390°F). After 10 minutes, open the door and check your pizza. Look for these signs of readiness:
*   **Crust:** The edges should be golden brown and crisp.
*   **Cheese:** The cheese should be fully melted, bubbly, and slightly browned in spots.
*   **Toppings:** Vegetables should look tender-crisp, and meats should be cooked through.

If your pizza needs more time, close the door and continue cooking in 2-minute increments. This allows you to monitor progress and prevent overcooking. Every microwave is slightly different, so learning your appliance's nuances is helpful. I find that some pizzas benefit from an extra minute or two to get that perfect crispness.

Once your pizza is cooked to perfection, carefully remove the metal rack from the convection microwave. Use oven mitts to protect your hands, as both the rack and the pizza will be very hot. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board. Let it rest for 2-3 minutes before slicing. This resting period allows the cheese to set slightly, preventing it from sliding off when you cut. It also helps the crust firm up.

### Tips for a Crispy Crust and Melted Cheese

Achieving a crispy crust and perfectly melted cheese is the hallmark of a great pizza. Here are some simple tips to elevate your convection microwave pizza:

**For a Crispy Crust:**

*   **Preheat Thoroughly:** Never skip preheating your convection microwave. A hot cooking environment from the start helps the pizza base crisp up immediately upon contact with the hot air. This initial burst of heat is essential for a firm base.
*   **Prick the Base:** As mentioned, thoroughly pricking your readymade pizza base with a fork before adding toppings is crucial. This lets trapped air and moisture escape during baking. It prevents large bubbles and keeps the base flat and crisp.
*   **Use the Metal Rack:** Always place your pizza on the high metal rack provided with your convection microwave. This ensures hot air circulates both above and below the pizza. Air circulation is key to even baking and a uniformly crispy bottom.
*   **Do Not Overload:** Less is more when it comes to toppings for a crispy crust. Excess sauce or watery vegetables release too much moisture. This moisture can steam the crust instead of baking it. Stick to moderate amounts of toppings.
*   **Optional Pre-bake:** For an extra crispy base, you can pre-bake the pricked pizza base for 3-5 minutes in convection mode at 200°C (390°F) before adding sauce and toppings. This creates a firmer foundation.

**For Perfectly Melted Cheese:**

*   **Room Temperature Cheese:** If possible, let your shredded cheese sit at room temperature for about 15-20 minutes before sprinkling it on the pizza. Room temperature cheese melts more evenly and quickly. Cold cheese can take longer to melt, risking an overcooked crust.
*   **Even Distribution:** Spread your cheese evenly over the sauce and a light layer over the toppings. This ensures every bite has that desired cheesy goodness. Avoid piling cheese in one spot.
*   **Quality Cheese:** Use good quality, low-moisture mozzarella. High-moisture mozzarella can release too much water, making the pizza soggy. Freshly shredded cheese also melts better than pre-shredded varieties, which often contain anti-caking agents.
*   **Monitor Browning:** Watch the cheese during the last few minutes of cooking. If you like slightly browned, bubbly cheese, let it cook until you see those golden spots. If it starts to brown too quickly, you can slightly reduce the temperature or cover the edges with foil.

By following these tips, you can consistently achieve a pizza with a delightful crispy crust and perfectly melted, gooey cheese. It really transforms your homemade pizza experience.
