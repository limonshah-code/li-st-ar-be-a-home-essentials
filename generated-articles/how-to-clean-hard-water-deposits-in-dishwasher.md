### Understanding Hard Water Deposits in Your Dishwasher

Have you noticed a white, chalky film inside your dishwasher? This is often hard water deposit. Hard water contains high levels of dissolved minerals. These minerals include calcium and magnesium.

Limescale affects your dishwasher in several ways. It can clog spray arms. It can reduce heating element efficiency. It also leaves spots on your dishes and glassware. Recognizing these signs helps you act quickly. Early action prevents bigger problems. Common signs include:

*   **Cloudy glassware:** Dishes come out looking dull or hazy.
