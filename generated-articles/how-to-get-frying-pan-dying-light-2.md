This special Frying Pan is officially known as the "Pan of Destiny." It hits hard and comes with high durability. Finding it takes some effort, but it is worth the time. The Pan of Destiny offers a fun, surprising way to dispatch infected. It shows the game developers' humor and creativity.

Players enjoy discovering these hidden gems. The Frying Pan adds a layer of depth to the weapon system. It encourages exploration and looking beyond obvious paths. I find these kinds of secrets make the game more exciting. You never know what you might find next.

The Pan of Destiny is a rare item. It gives a unique combat experience. Knowing how to get it helps you enjoy the game more. This weapon makes tough fights a bit more entertaining. It is a true collector's item for fans.

## The Pan of Destiny: An Exclusive Easter Egg Weapon

The **Pan of Destiny** is a legendary weapon in Dying Light 2. It is not just any Frying Pan; it has special stats and a cool look. This weapon is part of an Easter egg that many players seek. It provides a powerful melee option for clearing infected hordes.

Its high damage and durability make it a strong contender. The Pan of Destiny helps in close-quarters combat. You can swing it with surprising force. It feels good to land critical hits with this item.

This weapon fits into the category of **unique weapons Dying Light 2** offers. Such items provide an alternative to standard gear. They often come with specific challenges to obtain them. The Pan of Destiny is no different.

I personally love how Techland includes these fun items. They add character to the game world. It shows the developers care about player experience. The Pan of Destiny stands as a testament to that.

The Easter egg also includes the "Broom of Destiny." Both items are linked by their acquisition method. You will need to complete tasks related to both. This makes the hunt for the Frying Pan even more engaging.

## Preparing Your Journey to Get the Frying Pan

Before you can get the **Frying Pan Dying Light 2**, you must meet some requirements. The most important step is completing a specific main story mission. This mission is called "Broadcast." Finishing "Broadcast" unlocks a key location. This location is the VNC Tower.

The VNC Tower is a very tall skyscraper in Villedor. It becomes accessible after you finish "Broadcast." Accessing the top of this tower is crucial. This is where the Easter egg chain begins. You cannot start the quest for the Frying Pan until you finish this mission.

Make sure your character is strong enough for the climb. While getting the Frying Pan itself does not involve combat, the journey to the tower and its rooftop can be dangerous. You might encounter powerful infected or hostile human factions. Be ready for anything.

Ensure you have good parkour skills. The VNC Tower climb involves many challenging jumps and ledges. You will need to use your grappling hook and paraglider effectively. Practice these skills before starting. Good preparation makes the process smoother.

I remember struggling with some parkour sections myself. Taking your time and planning your moves helps. Do not rush any jumps. One wrong move can send you falling. Take some healing items with you for safety.

## The VNC Tower Challenge: Path to the Frying Pan

The true journey to the **Frying Pan in Dying Light 2** begins atop the VNC Tower. After completing the "Broadcast" mission, you must return to the tower's summit. Take the elevator to the top floor. From there, you must find a hidden path.

Look for a small power box on the roof. Interact with it to activate the Easter egg. This action triggers a series of floating platforms. These platforms form a challenging parkour course in the sky. This course leads to the Broom of Destiny.

The broomstick challenge is tough. You must navigate a precise path using the broomstick. It acts as a temporary vehicle. Missing a jump means falling and restarting. Take your time and learn the route.

Once you complete the broomstick course, you will reach a new area. This area contains a specific room. Inside this room, you will find a hidden switch. Activating this switch is key to getting the Frying Pan.

This section of the quest truly tests your patience and skill. The precise movements required can be frustrating. However, the reward of the **Pan of Destiny** is worth it. Stay calm and focus on each jump. Many players find this part to be the most memorable.

## Claiming Your Frying Pan: The Pan of Destiny Location

After successfully completing the VNC Tower broomstick challenge and activating the hidden switch, the **Frying Pan Dying Light 2** is within reach. You do not pick it up directly from the VNC Tower. The switch you activated opens a new path. It makes the Frying Pan appear in a different, specific location in Villedor.

You must now travel to the Bazaar. The Bazaar is a survivor stronghold located in Old Villedor. This area is familiar to most players from early in the game. Head to the roof of the Bazaar. This is where you will find the Pan of Destiny waiting for you.

Look around the rooftop area. The Frying Pan, or **Pan of Destiny**, will be on a table or near some supplies. It glows, making it easy to spot. Approach it and interact to pick it up. Once you do, it becomes a permanent part of your inventory.

This final step brings the entire Easter egg quest to a satisfying close. You have navigated treacherous heights and completed a tricky parkour puzzle. Now you hold the legendary Frying Pan. It is a moment of triumph for many players.

I felt a real sense of accomplishment when I finally picked it up. It felt like I earned a special secret. The design of the Pan of Destiny is unique. It stands out from other **melee weapons Dying Light 2** offers. Now, you are ready to put this powerful kitchen tool to use against the infected.

## Using the Frying Pan in Combat: Effectiveness and Fun

The **Frying Pan in Dying Light 2** is more than just a novelty; it is a surprisingly effective weapon. As the Pan of Destiny, it boasts high damage output. It also comes with above-average durability. This means you can use it for many fights before it breaks. It offers a satisfying thud when hitting infected.

This weapon shines in close-quarters combat. You can swing it quickly. Its broad surface helps stun enemies. I found it especially useful against weaker infected. It can easily knock them down. This gives you time to follow up or escape.

The Pan of Destiny is a fun alternative to standard swords or axes. It changes how you approach some encounters. Sometimes, a humorous weapon can make tough situations more enjoyable. It is like turning a dire situation into something more manageable, like when you go [from the frying pan into the fire](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-does-frying-pan-into-the-fire-mean).

Consider pairing the Frying Pan with other abilities. Skills that increase melee damage benefit it greatly. Upgrading your combat tree makes it even stronger. You can use it to break enemy guards. Then, switch to a faster weapon for a quick finish.

Its unique status also makes it a talking point among players. Showing off your Pan of Destiny is fun. It demonstrates your dedication to exploring all of Dying Light 2's secrets. This weapon provides a fresh combat experience. It reminds you that even the most ordinary items can become powerful tools in the right hands.

## Beyond the Frying Pan: Other Unique Melee Weapons in Dying Light 2

While the **Frying Pan in Dying Light 2** is a highlight, Villedor holds many other unique melee weapons. The game encourages exploration for these special finds. Each unique weapon offers distinct advantages. They add variety to your combat style.

One notable example is the Boomstick. This makeshift shotgun is powerful but has limited uses. It delivers massive damage at close range. Finding these rare **Dying Light 2 weapons** often involves specific quests or hidden areas. They are worth the hunt.

Another popular unique weapon is the Cyberpunk 2077 Easter egg sword. This sword has a unique visual effect and strong stats. It is a nod to another popular game. Players enjoy finding these cross-game references. They make the world feel richer.

Many of these unique weapons also have high durability. They do not break as easily as common weapons. This means you can rely on them longer in intense fights. Always keep an eye out for glowing items or suspicious areas. These often hide valuable loot.

I always enjoyed tracking down every unique weapon. It felt like collecting trophies. Each one tells a small story or offers a new way to fight. The Frying Pan fits perfectly into this collection of special gear. It provides a distinct feel compared to regular bats or pipes.

## Maintaining Your Frying Pan: Durability and Upgrades

The **Frying Pan in Dying Light 2**, like all weapons, has durability. This means it wears down with use. Every hit reduces its effectiveness. Eventually, it will break if not repaired. Knowing how to maintain your weapons is important.

Unfortunately, unique Easter egg weapons often cannot be repaired. This makes the Pan of Destiny a finite resource. You can use it until its durability runs out. After that, it is gone. This makes each swing with it feel more impactful.

To extend its life, use it strategically. Save it for tough enemies or boss fights. Do not waste its durability on weak infected. You can also use weapon mods to enhance its power. Mods can add elemental damage or improve handling.

Applying mods does not use up durability. This means you can still make your Pan of Destiny stronger. Look for mods that fit your playstyle. A mod that adds electrical damage, for instance, can stun enemies. This helps you conserve weapon life.

I always kept my best weapons for special occasions. It felt like I was saving them for when I truly needed them. The Frying Pan is perfect for this strategy. Its unique status makes it something to cherish. While you cannot clean it like a [real-world frying pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-frying-pans), you can make its limited lifespan more effective with wise choices.

If you enjoy keeping your weapons in top shape, remember that most regular weapons in the game *can* be repaired. This is done through certain NPCs or crafting stations. However, for the Pan of Destiny, cherish its limited lifespan. It is a rare and powerful tool. Its limited nature makes it special.
