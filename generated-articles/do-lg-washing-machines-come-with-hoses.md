### Understanding Washing Machine Hoses

Washing machines need hoses to operate. These hoses connect the appliance to your home's water system. There are two main types of hoses for any washing machine, including LG models. You have inlet hoses and a drain hose. Each hose has a specific job.

Inlet hoses bring clean water into the washer. There are usually two inlet hoses. One connects to the hot water supply. The other connects to the cold water supply. These hoses must handle water pressure and temperature changes. It is important to choose reliable hoses for this task. Using old or poor-quality inlet hoses can lead to costly leaks. Many people find that braided stainless steel hoses offer the best durability and safety. They resist bursting better than rubber hoses. You can learn more about hose compatibility and standards.

The drain hose removes dirty water from the machine. This hose connects from the back of the washer to a standpipe or utility sink. It is designed to carry away wastewater efficiently. Most new washing machines, including LG models, typically include a drain hose. Its length and flexibility are important for proper drainage. A securely placed drain hose prevents spills in your laundry area. Knowing these basics helps you prepare for your LG washing machine setup.

### What LG Typically Includes with Your Washer

When you purchase a new LG washing machine, you usually receive certain accessories. LG's standard practice is to include the drain hose. This hose is essential for directing wastewater away from the appliance. It typically comes attached or bundled with the washer. This means you won't need to buy a separate drain hose.

However, the crucial hot and cold water inlet hoses are generally not included. These hoses connect your washing machine to your home's water supply lines. LG, like many other appliance manufacturers, expects consumers to buy these separately. There are good reasons for this approach. Consumers can choose hoses that match their specific installation requirements. They can also select hoses of a desired quality, such as durable braided stainless steel. Always check the product description or ask the retailer for exact details about what is included. This ensures you have all necessary parts before your washer arrives.

### Inlet Hoses: Your Essential Water Connection

Inlet hoses are vital for your LG washing machine to function. These hoses bring clean hot and cold water into the appliance. You will need two separate hoses for this purpose. One connects to the hot water faucet, and the other to the cold water faucet. They typically attach to specific ports on the back of your LG washer.

The material of your inlet hoses matters greatly. Traditional rubber hoses are common, but they can degrade over time. They are prone to cracking or bursting, which can cause significant water damage. I strongly recommend upgrading to braided stainless steel hoses. These hoses offer superior durability and burst resistance. They provide an extra layer of protection against potential leaks. Selecting the right type and length is important for a secure connection. You also need to know if you need any additional sealant.

Ensuring a secure, leak-free connection is crucial for peace of mind.

Proper installation of these hoses is also key. Make sure to hand-tighten the connections first. Then, use a wrench for an additional quarter-turn. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the threads. Always check for leaks after turning on the water supply. These small steps ensure your LG washing machine receives water efficiently and safely.

### The Role of the Drain Hose

The drain hose is a critical component of your LG washing machine setup. Its primary function is to remove all the dirty water after each wash cycle. This wastewater includes soap, grime, and lint from your clothes. The hose directs this water away from your machine and out of your home. It usually empties into a standpipe or a utility sink.

Most LG washing machines come with a drain hose included. This saves you the trouble of buying one separately. The drain hose often has a curved end or a U-shaped guide. This helps it hook securely over the edge of a utility sink or into a standpipe. Proper positioning is important. You want to avoid kinks in the hose. Kinks can block water flow and lead to drainage issues. An improperly secured drain hose can also slip out, causing a flood.

Checking the drain hose regularly is a good practice. Look for any signs of wear, cracks, or blockages. Over time, lint and debris can build up inside. This can impede proper drainage. A clean and correctly installed drain hose ensures your LG washer can effectively complete its cycles. This maintains a tidy and functional laundry area. Many people also wonder about general hose compatibility. [Do new washing machines come with a drain hose?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-new-washing-machines-come-with-a-drain-hose) This question is common for all new washer purchases.

### Why Hoses Might Be Sold Separately

You might wonder why LG does not include inlet hoses with every washing machine. There are several practical reasons behind this common industry practice. One main reason is customization. Home installations vary greatly in terms of hose length requirements. Some laundry rooms have water connections very close to the washer. Others need longer hoses to reach across a wider space. Selling hoses separately allows you to choose the exact length you need. This avoids excess hose coiled behind your machine.

Another factor is quality and material choice. Inlet hoses come in different materials, such as rubber or braided stainless steel. Consumers often prefer the enhanced durability and leak protection of stainless steel hoses. By selling them separately, LG allows buyers to select their preferred hose material. This empowers you to make an informed decision for your home's safety. Rubber hoses are less expensive but carry a higher risk of bursting over time. Stainless steel hoses provide greater peace of mind.

Furthermore, selling hoses separately gives retailers flexibility. They can offer a range of hose options at different price points. This caters to diverse customer needs and budgets. It also contributes to slightly lower base prices for the washing machines themselves. Remember that even though LG does not include inlet hoses, it is a chance for you to upgrade your setup. You can choose the best options for your home.

### Choosing the Right Hoses for Your LG Washer

Selecting the correct hoses for your new LG washing machine is crucial. This choice impacts both performance and safety. When buying inlet hoses, focus on two main aspects: material and length. As I mentioned before, braided stainless steel hoses are the top recommendation. They are far more resistant to kinking, bursting, and corrosion than standard rubber hoses. While rubber hoses may be cheaper upfront, stainless steel offers greater longevity and reduces the risk of costly water damage.

For length, measure the distance between your washing machine's inlet valves and your home's water supply faucets. Add a little extra slack, but do not buy hoses that are excessively long. Too much slack can create coils. These coils can get tangled or stressed. Common lengths range from 4 to 6 feet. However, specialized setups might need longer ones. Make sure the connections on the hoses match the standard ¾ inch male garden hose thread. This is the common size for washing machine connections. You might also want to confirm if the hose fittings are truly standard.

Finally, consider buying hoses from reputable brands. You do not always need LG-branded hoses. Any high-quality universal washing machine hose will work fine. Investing in good hoses is a small cost compared to potential water damage from a hose failure. This decision is a simple way to protect your home.

### Installation Tips and Best Practices

Installing your LG washing machine with the correct hoses ensures safe operation. First, always make sure the water supply valves are turned off. This prevents any accidental water flow during the process. Connect the hot water inlet hose to the "H" (hot) valve on the wall and the corresponding hot water inlet on the washer. Do the same for the cold water hose. Hand-tighten these connections first until snug. Then, use pliers or a wrench for an additional quarter-turn. Avoid overtightening, as this can strip threads or damage rubber gaskets.

Next, install the drain hose. If it came with your LG washer, it might already be attached. If not, secure it to the drain outlet on the back of the machine. Guide the other end into a standpipe or over the edge of a utility sink. Ensure the drain hose is inserted far enough into the standpipe to prevent it from slipping out. However, do not create an airtight seal. An air gap is necessary for proper drainage and to prevent siphoning. After connecting all hoses, slowly turn on the water supply valves. Check carefully for any leaks at all connection points.

Regular inspection is a key best practice. I suggest checking your hoses every year or two. Look for bulges, cracks, fraying, or any signs of wear. Replace any damaged hoses immediately. Even braided stainless steel hoses can wear out over time. If you need to replace or simply remove hoses for maintenance.
