## Why Your Bosch Dishwasher Won't Drain: Common Solutions

It is frustrating when your Bosch dishwasher finishes a cycle, yet leaves a pool of dirty water inside. This problem, "why my Bosch dishwasher won't drain," happens to many homeowners. You open the door, expecting sparkling dishes, but find standing water instead. This issue stops your dishwasher from completing its job, and it signals a blockage or a faulty part.

This article explores the common reasons why a Bosch dishwasher won't drain. We will look at simple fixes you can try yourself. We will cover clogged filters, kinked drain hoses, and pump issues. You will gain a clear understanding of each problem. By the end, you will know how to diagnose and solve most Bosch dishwasher drainage problems.

### Takeaway

If your Bosch dishwasher won't drain, here are key steps:

*   Check and clean the filter system in the tub.
*   Inspect the drain hose for kinks or clogs.
*   Verify the air gap or high loop installation.
*   Examine the garbage disposal connection.
*   Consider issues with the drain pump or check valve.

When a Bosch dishwasher won't drain, it usually points to a clog in the filter, drain hose, or air gap. A faulty drain pump or issues with the garbage disposal connection are also common culprits. Addressing these components often resolves the drainage problem effectively.

### Clogged Dishwasher Filters and How to Clean Them

One of the most frequent reasons your Bosch dishwasher won't drain is a clogged filter system. Bosch dishwashers use a multi-stage filter to catch food particles. This system prevents debris from re-depositing on your clean dishes. Over time, these filters collect grease, food scraps, and other small items.

If too much debris builds up, water cannot pass through freely to the drain pump. This blockage stops the water from leaving the dishwasher tub. It is a simple problem to check and often a simple fix. Regularly cleaning these filters is important maintenance for any Bosch dishwasher.

To access the filters, open your dishwasher door. Look at the bottom of the tub. You will see a cylindrical filter assembly. Follow your Bosch manual for exact removal steps. Most models require a twist and lift motion.

Once you remove the filter, take it to your sink. Rinse it under running water. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away any stuck-on food or grease. Make sure to clean all parts of the filter, including the fine mesh screen. If you often experience a Bosch dishwasher not draining, make this a regular cleaning task.

After cleaning, put the filter back into place. Ensure it locks securely. A loose filter can also cause problems. Running a wash cycle empty after cleaning helps flush out any remaining loose debris. This simple cleaning step can solve many drainage issues quickly.

### Obstructed Dishwasher Drain Hose Issues

Another common cause for a Bosch dishwasher not draining is an obstructed or kinked drain hose. This hose carries the dirty water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. If the hose bends sharply, gets pinched, or fills with debris, water cannot flow out. Checking the drain hose is a crucial step in troubleshooting.

First, locate your dishwasher's drain hose. It usually runs from the back of the dishwasher to the plumbing under your sink. Pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet carefully to access the hose. Look for any visible kinks or bends in the hose. Straighten any kinks you find.

Sometimes, debris collects inside the hose itself. Food particles, grease, or even small plastic pieces can get stuck. Disconnect the drain hose from both ends. Have a bucket ready to catch any water. Blow through the hose to check for blockages. If air does not pass through, use a long, flexible brush or a straightened coat hanger to clear the obstruction. Be gentle to avoid damaging the hose.

Ensure the hose has a proper slope for water to drain. Gravity helps water flow through the hose. If the hose sags too much, water can sit in it, causing partial clogs or drainage issues. The hose should slope downward continuously towards the drain connection. If your Bosch dishwasher is still leaving water, inspecting this hose is a key action. It is often a very direct reason why your [Bosch dishwasher won't drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-bosch-dishwasher-to-drain).

Reattach the hose securely after inspection. Use hose clamps if needed to prevent leaks. Run a short cycle to test the drainage. A clear drain hose ensures water flows freely out of the appliance.

### Air Gap or High Loop Problems

The air gap or high loop is a critical component for proper dishwasher drainage. If your Bosch dishwasher won't drain, problems with these features are often the cause. The purpose of an air gap or high loop is to prevent dirty drain water from flowing back into the dishwasher. This backflow can contaminate your dishes.

An air gap is a small, cylindrical fitting found on your kitchen counter, usually next to the faucet. It has two hoses connected to it. One hose comes from the dishwasher. The other hose goes to the garbage disposal or sink drain. If this air gap gets clogged with food particles or grease, water cannot pass through it. This blockage stops the dishwasher from draining. Unscrew the cap of the air gap. Check for any visible debris inside. Clear any obstructions you find using a small brush or toothpick.

If you do not have an air gap, your dishwasher likely uses a "high loop" drain hose installation. This means the drain hose rises high under your sink before descending to connect to the drain. The highest point of the hose must be above the water level in the sink. This creates a natural air break. If the hose sags below this level, or if it is not installed correctly, it can lead to backflow or slow drainage. This is another reason your Bosch dishwasher might not drain.

Ensure the high loop is securely fastened. It should be at least 32 inches from the floor, usually attached to the underside of the counter. Use a zip tie or screw clamp to hold it in place. A simple check of these systems can often solve the problem of a Bosch dishwasher not draining. These setups are important for hygiene and drainage function. When your [dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/when-dishwasher-does-not-drain), these are key areas to inspect for correct setup and blockages.

### Faulty Dishwasher Drain Pump

If you have checked the filters, drain hose, and air gap, and your Bosch dishwasher won't drain, the problem might be with the drain pump. The drain pump is the motor that actively pushes water out of the dishwasher. If it fails, water remains in the tub. A faulty drain pump can make buzzing noises or no noise at all during the drain cycle.

The drain pump can fail due to several reasons. Sometimes, small, hard objects like glass shards, fruit pits, or broken plastic pieces get past the filter. These objects can jam the impeller, which is the part of the pump that spins to move water. Other times, the motor itself can burn out. This happens due to age or consistent overwork.

Before checking the pump, disconnect power to your dishwasher. Always turn off the circuit breaker for safety. You will need to access the drain pump, which is usually located underneath the dishwasher. You may need to tilt or pull the appliance out. Remove the access panel to see the pump.

Once you locate the pump, look for any visible debris jamming the impeller. Carefully remove any foreign objects. You can also try to manually turn the impeller to see if it moves freely. If it feels stiff or does not move, it is likely jammed or broken. You can also [test your Bosch dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-bosch-dishwasher-drain-pump) using a multimeter to check for electrical continuity. If there is no continuity, the pump needs replacement. Replacing a drain pump can be a complex task. If you are not comfortable doing it yourself, consider calling a professional. A non-functional pump is a direct cause for your Bosch dishwasher not draining.

### Garbage Disposal Connection Problems

Many Bosch dishwashers connect directly to a garbage disposal unit for drainage. If your Bosch dishwasher won't drain, and you have a garbage disposal, this connection is a likely area to check. Issues with the disposal can directly impact your dishwasher's ability to clear water. It is a common oversight that leads to frustrating drainage problems.

The most common issue is a newly installed garbage disposal. When a new disposal unit is installed, there is often a knockout plug inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet. This plug must be removed before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. If the plug remains in place, it acts as a complete blockage. Water simply cannot pass from the dishwasher to the disposal.

To check for this, disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the garbage disposal. Look inside the disposal's inlet where the hose connects. You might see a small, round plug. If it is there, use a screwdriver or hammer to knock it out. Be sure to remove the plug piece from inside the disposal before using it. This is a common and easy fix if you or someone else recently installed a new disposal.

Even if the plug is removed, the disposal can cause issues. If your garbage disposal is clogged, or if it is not running properly, it can prevent the dishwasher from draining. Run your garbage disposal for about 30 seconds with plenty of water. This helps clear any food debris. Make sure the disposal is completely empty before running the dishwasher. A full or sluggish disposal will directly hinder your Bosch dishwasher's drainage. Ensure the connection is secure and free of debris inside. This simple check often reveals the problem.

### Blocked Check Valve

Beneath your Bosch dishwasher, in the drainage system, you will find a small but important component called the check valve. This valve is designed to allow water to flow in one direction only: out of the dishwasher. It prevents dirty water from flowing back into the tub after it has been pumped out. If your Bosch dishwasher won't drain, a blocked or stuck check valve can be the culprit.

Over time, the check valve can accumulate small food particles, grease, or mineral deposits. These can cause the valve to stick in a closed position. If the valve sticks closed, it stops water from draining. If it sticks open, it allows water to flow back in, meaning you might see dirty water returning to the tub after a cycle. This is a subtle but significant issue.

Accessing the check valve often requires removing the dishwasher's lower access panel. You might also need to tilt or pull the dishwasher out from its space. The check valve is typically located near the drain pump or where the drain hose connects to the pump. It looks like a small, one-way flapper or a small plastic ball inside a housing. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before you begin.

Carefully detach the components around the check valve. Inspect the valve for any debris. Clean any visible blockages. Make sure the flapper moves freely or the ball is not stuck. If the check valve is damaged, cracked, or simply will not move after cleaning, it needs replacement. This part is usually inexpensive.

Replacing a faulty check valve can restore proper drainage. It ensures that the water pumped out stays out. A non-functional check valve directly interferes with the drainage process. If your Bosch dishwasher is experiencing issues, do not overlook this small part. It plays a big role in keeping your dishwasher empty and clean.

### Float Switch or Sensor Malfunctions

Sometimes, a Bosch dishwasher won't drain not because of a clog, but due to a sensor malfunction. Specifically, a faulty float switch or other water level sensors can trick the dishwasher. The float switch is a safety device. It detects the water level in the tub. Its main job is to prevent the dishwasher from overflowing. If it senses too much water, it tells the drain pump to activate. If it senses a normal level, it tells the water inlet valve to shut off.

If the float switch gets stuck in the "full" position, it constantly tells the dishwasher there is too much water. This signal can keep the drain pump running even when no water is present. Conversely, if it gets stuck in the "empty" position, it might not signal the pump to drain when it should. Food debris, soap scum, or mineral deposits can cause the float to stick.

To check the float switch, open the dishwasher door. Look for a small plastic or styrofoam cup-like device at the bottom of the tub, usually near the front. This is the float. Gently lift it up and push it down. It should move freely without resistance. If it feels sticky, clean around its base. Use warm, soapy water and a soft cloth to remove any grime. Ensure the area under the float is clear.

Beyond the float switch, other internal sensors manage water levels and cycles. If these sensors fail or give incorrect readings, the dishwasher's control board receives bad information. This can disrupt the drain cycle. For instance, the control board might think the tub is empty when it is full. This prevents the drain pump from activating. Troubleshooting sensor issues can be more complex. It often requires specific diagnostic steps or a technician. However, checking the physical float switch is a good first step. If your Bosch dishwasher does not drain, and you have ruled out clogs, consider a sensor problem.
