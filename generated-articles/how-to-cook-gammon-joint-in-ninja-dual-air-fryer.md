Cooking gammon in your air fryer changes the game. It offers speed, efficiency, and a way to get incredibly tender meat with a crispy exterior. We want to show you how simple it is to achieve this. This guide covers everything from choosing the right gammon to mastering cooking times and creating a perfect glaze. You will learn the specific steps needed to cook a gammon joint in your Ninja Dual Air Fryer. Get ready to impress your family and friends with a perfectly cooked meal using this versatile kitchen gadget.

### Takeaway

*   **Prepare Your Gammon:** Soak if unsmoked, pat dry, score the fat, and season well.
*   **Preheat Your Air Fryer:** Always preheat your Ninja Dual Air Fryer for even cooking.
*   **Cook at the Right Temperature:** Start lower, then increase for a crispy finish.
*   **Use a Meat Thermometer:** Ensure an internal temperature of 71°C (160°F) for safety.
*   **Rest the Gammon:** Allow it to rest for 10-15 minutes after cooking for juicy results.

### Quick Answer: Cooking Gammon in a Ninja Dual Air Fryer

To cook a gammon joint in a Ninja Dual Air Fryer, preheat to 160°C (320°F). Cook for 15-20 minutes per 450g (1 lb), turning halfway. Increase temperature to 180°C (350°F) for the last 15-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 71°C (160°F). Rest for 10-15 minutes before carving for optimal juiciness.

### Why Choose Your Ninja Dual Air Fryer for Gammon?

Using your Ninja Dual Air Fryer for a gammon joint offers many advantages. Air frying circulates hot air around the food. This creates an even cook and a fantastic texture. For gammon, this means a wonderfully tender inside and a crispy, golden exterior.

Traditional oven cooking often requires longer times and can dry out the meat. An air fryer, however, cooks more quickly and seals in moisture. This results in a juicier gammon joint every time. It also uses less energy compared to a large oven. This makes it a more economical choice for your family meals.

The Ninja Dual Air Fryer specifically shines here. Its two separate cooking zones allow you to cook different items at different temperatures. While you might use both zones for your gammon, it means you can also cook a side dish at the same time. This feature saves time and effort, making meal preparation simple. The air fryer delivers consistent results. You get perfectly cooked gammon without constant monitoring.

### Choosing and Preparing Your Gammon Joint

Selecting the right gammon joint is the first step to success. Gammon comes in two main types: smoked and unsmoked. Smoked gammon has a saltier, more intense flavor. Unsmoked gammon has a milder taste, more like fresh ham. Choose the type that best suits your preference.

Consider the size of your gammon joint in relation to your Ninja Dual Air Fryer basket. Most dual air fryers can comfortably fit a joint up to 1.5kg (3.3 lbs). If your joint is too big, it will not cook evenly. A snug fit is fine, but avoid forcing it.

Preparation is key for a perfect gammon. If you have an unsmoked gammon joint, you may want to soak it in cold water for a few hours. Change the water a few times. This helps to reduce the saltiness. Smoked gammon usually does not need soaking. Always pat the gammon joint very dry with paper towels before cooking. This helps create a crispier skin. Scoring the fat in a criss-cross pattern also helps the fat render and crisp up beautifully. You can also rub it with your favorite seasonings at this stage.

### Essential Equipment and Ingredients for Air Frying Gammon

Having the right tools makes cooking a gammon joint simple. Of course, your Ninja Dual Air Fryer is the star appliance. Make sure it is clean and ready for use. If you are new to the appliance, a quick review of how to use your specific model, like the [Ninja Dual Air Fryer 9.5 Litre](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-ninja-dual-air-fryer-9-5-litre), can be helpful.

A reliable meat thermometer is crucial. This tool ensures your gammon reaches a safe internal temperature. It also prevents overcooking, keeping the meat juicy. Digital thermometers are easy to read and give quick results.

You might also want aluminum foil. This can help prevent the gammon from browning too quickly. Some people like to use a small trivet or a rack within the air fryer basket. This lifts the gammon slightly, allowing for better air circulation underneath. However, it is not always necessary.

For ingredients, you will need your chosen gammon joint. Simple seasonings like black pepper are often enough. Many people love to add a glaze during the last part of cooking. Common glaze ingredients include honey, maple syrup, mustard, or brown sugar. Prepare your glaze ingredients beforehand. This ensures a smooth cooking process.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Cooking Gammon in the Ninja Dual Air Fryer

Cooking a delicious gammon joint in your Ninja Dual Air Fryer is straightforward. Follow these steps for perfect results. First, ensure your gammon is prepared as discussed earlier, patted dry, and scored.

**1. Preheat the Air Fryer:**
Always preheat your Ninja Dual Air Fryer. Set the temperature to 160°C (320°F). Let it preheat for about 5-7 minutes. Preheating ensures even cooking from the start.

**2. Place the Gammon:**
Carefully place the gammon joint into one of the air fryer baskets. If you have a larger joint, it might take up both baskets. Ensure there is some space around the joint for air to circulate. You can place it fat-side up.

**3. Initial Cooking Phase:**
Cook the gammon at 160°C (320°F) for approximately 15-20 minutes per 450g (1 pound) of meat. For example, a 1.5kg (3.3lb) joint would cook for about 50-60 minutes in this phase. Halfway through this time, carefully flip the gammon joint. This promotes even cooking.

**4. Glazing and Final Cooking:**
If you plan to glaze your gammon, prepare your glaze. After the initial cooking time, brush the glaze over the gammon joint. Increase the air fryer temperature to 180°C (350°F). Continue cooking for another 15-20 minutes. Keep an eye on it to prevent the glaze from burning. This final phase helps crisp up the fat and caramelize the glaze.

**5. Check Internal Temperature:**
The most important step is checking the internal temperature. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the gammon joint. Make sure it does not touch any bone. The gammon is fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 71°C (160°F). If it is not quite there, continue cooking in 5-minute increments until it reaches the safe temperature. Understanding internal temperatures is vital for any meat, similar to cooking a whole chicken; see our guide on [How Long to Cook Whole Chicken in Cosori Air Fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-to-cook-whole-chicken-in-cosori-air-fryer).

**6. Rest the Gammon:**
Once cooked, remove the gammon joint from the air fryer. Place it on a cutting board and tent it loosely with aluminum foil. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes. Resting allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. This makes your gammon incredibly juicy and tender when you carve it. Do not skip this step.

### Achieving Perfect Crispiness and Juiciness

Achieving a gammon joint that is both juicy on the inside and beautifully crispy on the outside is the goal. Your Ninja Dual Air Fryer is excellent at this. Here are some tips to help you get the best results.

First, ensure your gammon joint is very dry before it goes into the air fryer. Patting it thoroughly with paper towels removes surface moisture. This allows the fat to crisp up more efficiently. Scoring the fat also helps. Cut shallow lines across the fat cap in a criss-cross pattern. This helps the fat render out and become crispy. It also allows any glaze to penetrate better.

For the juiciness, precise temperature control is key. Starting the gammon at a lower temperature (160°C/320°F) cooks the meat gently. This prevents the outside from burning before the inside cooks through. Then, increasing the temperature at the end (180°C/350°F) provides the blast of heat needed for that crispy finish. You can also place a small amount of water (about 1/4 cup) in the bottom of the air fryer basket if you are worried about the meat drying out. The steam helps maintain moisture.

Finally, do not forget the resting period. This step is often overlooked but it is vital. When meat cooks, its fibers tighten, pushing juices to the center. Resting allows these fibers to relax and the juices to redistribute. This ensures every slice of your gammon joint is tender and bursting with flavor. If you carve it too soon, the juices will simply run out, leaving you with dry meat.

### Troubleshooting Common Gammon Air Frying Issues

Even with the best instructions, sometimes things do not go as planned. Here are common issues you might face when air frying gammon and how to fix them.

**1. Gammon is Too Dry:**
If your gammon turns out dry, it likely cooked for too long or at too high a temperature initially. Overcooking removes moisture. To prevent this, always use a meat thermometer. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 71°C (160°F), then remove it. You can also try adding a small amount of water to the bottom of the air fryer basket to create some steam. This helps keep the environment moist. Resting the gammon for the full 10-15 minutes after cooking is also crucial for juiciness.

**2. Fat is Not Crispy Enough:**
If the fat cap on your gammon is not crispy, ensure it was scored properly. The criss-cross cuts help the fat render. Also, make sure the gammon was patted very dry before cooking. Any moisture on the surface will steam the fat instead of crisping it. Increasing the temperature during the last 15-20 minutes of cooking (to 180°C/350°F) helps brown and crisp the fat. If it still needs more crispiness, cook for another 5-10 minutes at 200°C (390°F), watching it closely.

**3. Uneven Cooking:**
Uneven cooking can happen if the gammon joint is too large for the basket. Or, if it is not turned during cooking. Ensure your gammon fits comfortably in the air fryer basket. Leave some space around it for air circulation. Flipping the gammon halfway through the cooking time helps ensure all sides cook evenly. If using a dual-zone air fryer, you can rotate the basket between zones if one side cooks faster.

**4. Glaze Burns:**
A sugary glaze can burn quickly at high temperatures. Apply the glaze only during the last 15-20 minutes of cooking, after the main cooking is done. If it starts to darken too quickly, you can loosely tent the gammon with aluminum foil. This shields the glaze from direct heat while the meat finishes cooking.

By understanding these common issues and their solutions, you can adjust your approach and get a perfectly cooked gammon joint next time.

### Serving Suggestions and Leftovers

Once your beautiful gammon joint is cooked and rested, it is time to carve and serve. Carving gammon is straightforward. Use a sharp carving knife. Slice against the grain of the meat for the most tender pieces. The grain refers to the direction of the muscle fibers. Cutting across them shortens the fibers, making the meat easier to chew.

Gammon is incredibly versatile and pairs well with many side dishes. For a classic meal, serve it with:

*   **Roasted potatoes:** You can even cook these in the other basket of your Ninja Dual Air Fryer! Consider making [Jacket Potatoes in Ninja Dual Air Fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-cook-jacket-potato-in-ninja-dual-air-fryer) for an easy side.
*   **Steamed vegetables:** Broccoli, green beans, or carrots add color and nutrients.
*   **Coleslaw or a fresh green salad:** For a lighter contrast.
*   **Apple sauce or mustard:** These traditional condiments complement gammon wonderfully.

Leftover gammon is just as delicious and useful. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. You can use it in many ways:

*   **Sandwiches:** Thinly sliced gammon makes a fantastic sandwich filling.
*   **Gammon and egg:** A classic breakfast or brunch option.
*   **Stir-fries:** Dice the gammon and add it to a quick stir-fry with vegetables.
*   **Pasta dishes:** Cut into cubes and toss with pasta, cream sauce, and peas.
*   **Soups or stews:** Add diced gammon to give a smoky flavor to your favorite soup or stew.

Enjoying your perfectly cooked gammon joint is a treat, and knowing how to use the leftovers extends that enjoyment!

### FAQ Section

**Q: Can I cook a whole gammon joint in a smaller Ninja air fryer?**
A: It depends on the size of your specific air fryer basket. Smaller Ninja models might only fit a 1kg (2.2lb) joint comfortably. A Ninja Dual Air Fryer, especially the 9.5-litre model, can usually handle joints up to 1.5kg (3.3lb) or even 2kg (4.4lb) if carefully placed. Always ensure air can circulate around the joint.

**Q: Do I need to pre-boil gammon before air frying?**
A: No, you do not need to pre-boil gammon before air frying. Air frying cooks the gammon effectively without this step. Some people traditionally boil gammon to reduce saltiness or tenderize it. If your gammon is very salty or you prefer extra tender meat, you can soak it in cold water for a few hours before cooking.

**Q: How long does it take to cook a 1kg gammon joint in a Ninja air fryer?**
A: For a 1kg (2.2lb) gammon joint, expect approximately 35-45 minutes of cooking time. Start at 160°C (320°F) for 25-30 minutes, then increase to 180°C (350°F) for 10-15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 71°C (160°F). Always use a meat thermometer to confirm doneness.

**Q: What temperature should I cook gammon at in an air fryer?**
A: Start cooking your gammon joint at 160°C (320°F). This lower temperature helps cook the meat thoroughly without burning the outside. For the last 15-20 minutes, increase the temperature to 180°C (350°F). This higher heat helps crisp the fat and caramelize any glaze you apply.

**Q: How do I know when my gammon is cooked through?**
A: The most reliable way to know if your gammon is cooked through is by checking its internal temperature. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the joint, avoiding any bone. The gammon is safely cooked when the internal temperature reaches 71°C (160°F).

**Q: Can I put foil in a Ninja air fryer?**
A: Yes, you can put aluminum foil in a Ninja air fryer. Use it to loosely tent the gammon if the outside is browning too quickly. Do not block the air circulation. Also, do not place foil directly over the heating element. Ensure foil is weighed down by food to prevent it from flying around and touching the heating coil.
