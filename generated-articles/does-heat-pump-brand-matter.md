## Understanding Heat Pump Systems

Let's start by understanding what a heat pump does. A heat pump is an HVAC system. It provides both heating and cooling for your home. Unlike furnaces that burn fuel, heat pumps move heat. In winter, they extract heat from outside air or ground and bring it inside. In summer, they reverse the process. They remove heat from inside your home and release it outdoors. This makes them highly energy-efficient.

Heat pumps work by using a refrigerant to absorb and release heat. They do not generate heat directly. They simply move it from one place to another. This transfer process uses less energy compared to converting fuel into heat. This design helps homeowners save on utility bills. Many people ask, [what is heat pump system](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-heat-pump-system)? It is a versatile climate control solution. It handles both heating and cooling needs.

The basic operation involves an outdoor unit and an indoor unit. The outdoor unit contains a compressor and coils. The indoor unit, often called an air handler, also has coils and a fan. These components work together to circulate refrigerant. This refrigerant changes state between liquid and gas. This change allows it to absorb and release heat.
