### Takeaway

*   Check shoe material first; not all shoes are machine washable.
*   Prepare shoes by removing laces, insoles, and loose dirt.
*   Use cold water and a gentle cycle with old towels for balance.
*   Always air dry shoes; never put them in a dryer.

### Can you machine wash shoes?

Yes, you can machine wash many types of shoes safely. It works best for sneakers, canvas, and athletic shoes made from synthetic materials. Always use cold water and a gentle cycle. Place shoes in a mesh laundry bag. Add a few old towels to balance the load and cushion the shoes. Air dry your shoes completely afterwards.

### Is Your Shoe Washable? Understanding Material Compatibility

Before you throw any shoes into the washing machine, check their material. This step is very important. Washing the wrong kind of shoe can cause permanent damage. You want to make sure your shoes can handle the wash cycle.

Most athletic shoes and sneakers are good candidates. Shoes made of canvas, nylon, cotton, or polyester usually machine wash well. These materials handle water and detergent without shrinking or deforming. Think about your running shoes or casual canvas slip-ons. These types often come out looking great.

On the other hand, some materials should never go into a washing machine. Leather and suede are big no-nos. Water and harsh detergents can ruin their texture and shape. Leather shoes might crack or stiffen. Suede can become stiff, discolored, or lose its soft feel. Shoes with delicate embellishments, beads, or sequins also need hand washing. The machine cycle can pull these off. Avoid washing shoes with sensitive glues or dyes, as they may come apart or bleed color. For instance, shoes like certain formal wear or boots are not meant for machine washing. Knowing your shoe's material helps you keep it in good condition. You can machine wash most regular sneakers. However, always be careful with special materials. [Can you machine wash leather shoes?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-machine-wash-leather-shoes) No, you cannot. Always hand wash delicate materials.

Sometimes, a shoe's tag tells you if it is machine washable. Many modern athletic shoe brands design their footwear for easy cleaning. Brands like Kizik or Hey Dude often have models that are machine washable. If you are unsure, a quick search for your shoe brand and model can confirm. For instance, [can you machine wash Kizik shoes?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-machine-wash-kizik-shoes) Many models are designed to be, but always check their specific care instructions. Similarly, [can I machine wash Hey Dude shoes?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-machine-wash-hey-dude-shoes) Yes, many Hey Dude shoes are machine washable, especially their canvas and synthetic styles. This initial check saves you from potential mishaps. Knowing your shoe's material is the first step to successful machine washing.

### Pre-Wash Preparations: Getting Your Shoes Ready

Proper preparation makes a big difference in how well your shoes clean. It also protects your washing machine. Do not just toss your dirty shoes straight into the drum. A few simple steps beforehand help ensure a better outcome. Taking these steps prevents dirt from clogging your machine.

First, remove loose dirt and debris from your shoes. Take them outside and knock the soles together. This removes mud, small rocks, and excess dirt. You can use an old toothbrush or a stiff brush to scrub off stubborn grime from the soles. Pay attention to the treads. This prevents large chunks of dirt from going into your washer. Removing debris also helps the cleaning process work more effectively.

Next, take out the laces and insoles. Wash these items separately for a more thorough clean. Laces can tangle in the machine. Insoles sometimes hold more odor and dirt. You can place laces in a small mesh bag to keep them from getting lost. Insoles can be hand-washed or placed in a separate small bag with the shoes. If your insoles are made of delicate material or have arch supports, hand washing them is best. Many people wonder, [can you wash shoes in a laundry machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-laundry-machine) Yes, you can, but these preparatory steps are key to success.

Finally, place your shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag protects your shoes from banging around during the wash cycle. It also protects your washing machine drum from scratches or dents. If you do not have a mesh bag, an old pillowcase tied shut works too. Putting each shoe in its own bag is ideal. This keeps them from clanking against each other. This thoughtful preparation ensures a safer and more effective cleaning for both your shoes and your appliance.

### The Washing Machine Settings: Choosing the Right Cycle

Choosing the correct washing machine settings is vital for cleaning shoes safely. The wrong settings can damage your shoes or your appliance. You want a gentle wash that removes dirt without being too harsh. This avoids shrinking, stretching, or breaking down shoe materials.

Always use cold water. Hot water can cause shoes to shrink or warp. It can also loosen glues used in shoe construction. Cold water is effective enough for most dirt and stains on machine-washable shoes. It is also gentler on the fabric and colors. Using cold water helps colors stay vibrant and prevents dye transfer. This is especially true for white shoes where color bleeding can be very noticeable.

Select a gentle or delicate cycle. This cycle uses slower agitation and spin speeds. It reduces the impact on your shoes. A normal or heavy-duty cycle is too aggressive. It can cause shoes to bang around excessively, leading to damage. Look for settings like "hand wash," "delicate," or "gentle" on your machine. Many modern washing machines have a specific setting for athletic wear, which can also work well. When considering specific models, you might wonder, [can you wash shoes in an LG washing machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-lg-washing-machine) Yes, LG machines, like many others, have gentle cycles that are suitable. The same applies if you ask, [can you wash shoes in a Bosch washing machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-bosch-washing-machine)? Most Bosch models also offer delicate settings perfect for this task.

Add a few old towels to the wash load. This is a clever trick. The towels provide cushioning for your shoes. They prevent them from knocking loudly against the washer drum. The towels also help balance the load, which is good for the washing machine's mechanics. Use towels that you do not mind getting dirty or wet. They should be similar in color to your shoes to avoid any dye transfer, especially with white shoes. Avoid using new or dark-colored towels if washing white shoes. Using the right settings and adding towels protects both your shoes and your washing machine.

### Washing Different Shoe Types: Specific Considerations

Not all machine-washable shoes are exactly alike. Different materials and shoe types need slightly varied approaches. Understanding these specific needs helps ensure a perfect clean every time. It prevents common mistakes and helps your shoes last longer.

For **tennis shoes and athletic sneakers**, the general rules apply well. Remove laces and insoles. Place them in a mesh bag. Use cold water and a gentle cycle. [How to wash tennis shoes in a machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-tennis-shoes-in-machine) is often a common question. The key is to protect their structure. Add towels to cushion them. Many athletic shoes are designed for durability, making them good candidates for machine washing. After washing, reshape them with paper or old towels.

**Smelly shoes** need extra attention. Odor comes from bacteria. To tackle this, add a cup of white vinegar to the wash cycle. White vinegar is a natural deodorizer and disinfectant. You can also sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes before washing them. This absorbs odors. Place the shoes in the mesh bag as usual. The cold water and gentle cycle will still be effective. This helps remove lingering smells, leaving shoes fresh. [How to wash smelly shoes in a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-smelly-shoes-in-washing-machine) involves these extra steps.

**White shoes** require special care to keep their bright appearance. They show dirt and stains easily. Before washing, pretreat any visible stains with a mild stain remover. Mix a paste of baking soda and a small amount of hydrogen peroxide. Apply it to stubborn stains. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, brush it off before putting shoes in the wash. Always wash white shoes with other white items or light-colored towels. This prevents dye transfer. Use a non-bleach detergent designed for whites. [How to clean white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes) effectively means careful pretreatment. Similarly, understanding [how to get white shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-white-shoes-clean) involves these same methods. You might also ask, [how to clean my white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-my-white-shoes)? The answer is consistent: pre-treat, wash cold on delicate, and air dry.

**Wool shoes**, like certain casual styles, can also be machine washed. However, wool is a delicate fiber. It can shrink or felt if exposed to too much heat or agitation. Use the wool or hand wash cycle on your machine. This cycle is very gentle. Use a wool-specific detergent. Cold water is essential. After washing, gently reshape the shoes. Lay them flat to dry. [How to clean wool shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-wool-shoes) requires extra caution with temperature and agitation.

For **water shoes**, cleaning them in the machine is generally safe. These shoes are often made from quick-drying synthetic materials. They are designed to get wet. Remove any visible sand or small pebbles first. Then, place them in a mesh bag. A regular gentle cycle with cold water is fine. Air dry them thoroughly. [How to clean water shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-water-shoes) is usually straightforward due to their durable, water-friendly construction.

Each shoe type benefits from these specific considerations. This helps achieve the best cleaning results without causing damage.

### Drying Your Shoes Safely: Air-Drying Best Practices

After a successful wash, proper drying is the next critical step. This stage ensures your shoes maintain their shape and do not develop mildew. Never put your shoes in a machine dryer. The heat from a dryer is very damaging to shoes. It can melt glues, shrink fabrics, and warp plastic or rubber components. High heat also often creates strange noises and can be hard on the dryer itself.

Air drying is the safest and most effective method. Place your washed shoes in a well-ventilated area. A sunny spot outside or a room with good air circulation works best. Remove them from the mesh laundry bag. You want air to reach all parts of the shoe. If you have a clothesline, hanging them by the tongue or heel can speed up drying. Use clothes pegs.

To help maintain the shoe's shape and absorb excess moisture, stuff them with paper towels or old newspaper. Avoid using colored newspaper as ink can transfer to your shoes. Plain white paper towels are ideal. Replace the paper periodically as it absorbs moisture. This helps the shoes dry faster from the inside out. It also prevents them from losing their original form as they dry. This technique is especially useful for athletic shoes.

Drying time varies depending on the shoe material and humidity levels. It can take anywhere from 12 hours to a few days. Be patient. Ensure shoes are completely dry before you wear them or store them. Putting on damp shoes can lead to foot odor and mildew growth. [Can I dry shoes in a washing machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-dry-shoes-in-washing-machine) No, you cannot. A washing machine performs the wash cycle only. It does not have a drying function for shoes. This is a common misconception. Allowing shoes to air dry naturally preserves their integrity and extends their lifespan. Proper air drying is just as important as the wash itself.

### Post-Wash Care and Maintenance: Keeping Them Clean Longer

Cleaning your shoes does not stop once they are dry. Post-wash care and regular maintenance help keep them looking good. This also extends the time between major washes. A little effort after cleaning goes a long way. It protects your investment in footwear.

Once your shoes are fully dry, put the laces and insoles back in. If the laces are still a bit dull, you can buy new ones. New laces can make a big difference in how clean the shoes look. For insoles, consider sprinkling a little baking soda inside them. This helps absorb any lingering moisture or odor. Let it sit for a few hours or overnight, then tap it out. This keeps the inside of your shoes fresh.

To help prevent future dirt buildup, consider applying a stain and water repellent spray. This creates a protective barrier on the shoe's surface. It makes dirt and liquids less likely to penetrate the fabric. It makes cleaning easier next time. Always choose a spray suitable for your shoe's material. Test it on a small, hidden area first. This prevents any unwanted discoloration.

Regular, light cleaning between washes is crucial for maintenance. If you notice a small scuff or dirt spot, wipe it immediately. Use a damp cloth or a mild shoe cleaner. This prevents dirt from setting in. Brush off loose dirt from the soles after each wear. A shoe brush or an old toothbrush works well for this. Store your shoes properly when not in use. Keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Using shoe trees or stuffing them with paper helps maintain their shape.

Good shoe hygiene also helps keep them clean. Alternate wearing different pairs of shoes. This allows each pair to fully air out between uses. This practice reduces moisture and odor buildup. It also gives the shoes time to recover their shape. Following these simple post-wash and maintenance tips keeps your shoes looking great. It also means you will not need to machine wash them as often. Learning [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean) involves consistent care.

### What Not to Machine Wash: Protecting Your Footwear Investment

While machine washing is convenient for many shoes, it is not for all of them. Certain materials and constructions are simply too delicate or incompatible with a washing machine. Attempting to machine wash these shoes will likely lead to damage. This damage can be irreversible. Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to wash.

**Leather and Suede Shoes:** These materials are top of the list for "do not machine wash." Water causes leather to stiffen, crack, and lose its natural oils. It can also permanently discolor it. Suede is even more sensitive. It can shrink, become brittle, or develop hard spots when wet. Both materials need specialized cleaning methods, often involving specific brushes, cleaners, and conditioning agents. [Can you machine wash leather shoes?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-machine-wash-leather-shoes) No, you cannot. This is a common mistake. Always avoid putting any leather or suede items in the washing machine.

**Shoes with Delicate Embellishments:** Shoes featuring beads, sequins, embroidery, glitter, or delicate buckles should stay out of the machine. The strong agitation and spinning can easily rip off these decorative elements. This not only ruins the shoe's appearance but can also damage your washing machine. Loose embellishments might get stuck in the drain or agitator. Hand cleaning specific spots is a safer option for these types of shoes.

**Shoes with Adhesive Construction:** Many shoes use strong adhesives to hold parts together. Examples include running shoes with complex sole constructions. While some athletic shoes are designed to be washable, others are not. High heat or harsh detergents can weaken these glues. This can cause soles to separate from the upper. The shoe might literally fall apart in the wash. If you see signs of glue around seams, proceed with caution. Unless the manufacturer explicitly states machine washability, hand washing or spot cleaning is safer.

**High Heels, Dress Shoes, and Boots (Non-waterproof):** These types of footwear are generally not meant for machine washing. They often have rigid structures, delicate materials, or specific shapes that water and agitation would distort. Heels can break. Soles can detach. Boots often have leather or other sensitive components. Always check the care label or manufacturer's website for specific cleaning instructions for these items.

**Shoes with Mold or Mildew:** While you might think washing helps, it can spread mold spores within your machine. For shoes with significant mold growth, specific treatments are needed first. [How to clean mold off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes) often involves a vinegar or bleach solution, followed by thorough drying *before* considering any machine wash. Washing moldy shoes directly can contaminate your washer. This can then transfer mold to other laundry items.

Understanding these exceptions protects your footwear. It also keeps your washing machine working properly. When in doubt, always opt for hand cleaning or spot treatment.

### FAQ Section

#### Q1: What kind of detergent should I use for machine washing shoes?
Use a mild liquid detergent. Avoid powdered detergents as they might not dissolve completely and can leave residue. Do not use bleach unless you are specifically washing white shoes and the shoe material allows it. A gentle, color-safe detergent is always the best choice for general shoe cleaning.

#### Q2: Can I wash shoes with clothes in the same load?
It is not recommended to wash shoes with your regular clothes. Shoes can carry dirt, debris, and strong odors that might transfer to your garments. Also, shoes can be abrasive and potentially damage delicate clothing items. Always wash shoes in a separate load, preferably with old towels for cushioning.

#### Q3: How often can I machine wash my shoes?
Machine washing should be done sparingly, only when shoes are significantly dirty or smelly. Over-washing can shorten the lifespan of your shoes. For light dirt, spot cleaning is better. For moderate dirt, a machine wash every few months or as needed is usually sufficient.

#### Q4: My shoes still smell after washing. What can I do?
Lingering odor often means bacteria were not fully removed. Try washing them again with added white vinegar or a specialized athletic laundry booster. Ensure shoes dry completely and quickly. Stuffing them with baking soda or using shoe deodorizers after drying can also help.

#### Q5: Can I wash my shoes if they have removable insoles?
Yes, you can. It is always best to remove removable insoles before washing the shoes. You can hand wash them separately or place them in a small mesh bag alongside the shoes in the washing machine. This allows for a more thorough cleaning of both the shoe and the insole.

#### Q6: How do I remove stubborn stains before machine washing?
For stubborn stains, pretreat them before washing. Use a mild stain remover or a paste of baking soda and a small amount of water or hydrogen peroxide. Apply the paste directly to the stain, let it sit for 15-30 minutes, and then gently scrub it with an old toothbrush. Then, proceed with the machine wash.

### Conclusion

Machine washing shoes can be a very effective way to refresh your favorite footwear. You can achieve great results by following the correct steps. Remember to check your shoe's material first. Always prepare your shoes by removing laces and loose dirt. Use cold water and a gentle cycle with old towels for cushioning. This protects both your shoes and your washing machine.
