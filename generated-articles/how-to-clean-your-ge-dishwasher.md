This buildup can make your dishwasher smell bad. It also reduces cleaning performance. Knowing how to clean your GE dishwasher correctly keeps it efficient. A clean dishwasher ensures your dishes come out sparkling. This guide helps you maintain your appliance for years of good service.

Regular cleaning prevents costly repairs. It also extends your dishwasher's lifespan. I want your GE dishwasher to perform its best. We will cover everything from basic filter cleaning to deep interior scrubbing. You will learn about effective cleaning agents and common pitfalls to avoid. Prepare to transform your appliance.

### Takeaway

To clean your GE dishwasher, you must first remove food debris from the filter. Next, wipe down the interior and spray arms. Then, run a cleaning cycle with a suitable dishwasher cleaner, vinegar, or baking soda to remove grease and mineral buildup. This process ensures your appliance runs efficiently and keeps dishes spotless.

## Why Your GE Dishwasher Needs Regular Cleaning

Your GE dishwasher is a powerful cleaning tool. Yet, it washes away food particles and grease. Some of these particles remain inside the machine. Over time, this debris accumulates. It forms a film on the interior surfaces. This film becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. It also traps odors.

Hard water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. These minerals leave scale deposits. You might notice white residue on your dishes. This is a sign of mineral buildup. These deposits can clog spray arm nozzles. They also reduce water flow. Your dishes may not get clean.

A dirty dishwasher works harder. It uses more energy to achieve the same results. This increases your utility bills. It also puts strain on the motor. Regular cleaning prevents these problems. It helps maintain the dishwasher's efficiency. It keeps your dishes spotless.

Think of your dishwasher as a self-cleaning appliance. Many people do. But this idea is false. The dishwasher washes dishes. It does not wash itself. Food particles and grease remain. They build up in the filter. They stick to the walls and spray arms. This buildup creates issues.

A common issue is a bad smell. Your dishwasher might smell like mildew or rotten food. This smell comes from trapped debris. It comes from bacteria growth. Cleaning removes these sources. It leaves your dishwasher fresh. A clean dishwasher means cleaner dishes. It is a simple step to better hygiene.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies for Your GE Dishwasher

Before you start cleaning, gather your tools. Having everything ready makes the process easy. You probably own most of these items already. No special equipment is usually necessary. A few common household products will do the job well.

First, you need a pair of rubber gloves. These protect your hands from cleaning solutions. They also keep your hands clean when dealing with grime. Next, grab a soft cloth or sponge. These are for wiping surfaces. Do not use abrasive scrubbers. They can scratch the dishwasher's interior. A small brush, like an old toothbrush, is also helpful. This helps clean small crevices and spray arm holes.

For cleaning solutions, you have options. White vinegar is a popular choice. It is natural and effective at dissolving mineral deposits. Baking soda also works well. It absorbs odors and provides a gentle abrasive action. You can also use a specialized dishwasher cleaner. These products target specific buildups. They are often found in the appliance aisle of stores. Always check your GE owner's manual for recommended cleaners.

You might need a small bowl or cup. This holds cleaning solutions during specific steps. A flashlight can help too. It lets you see into dark corners. This ensures you do not miss any dirty spots. Finally, have some paper towels ready. These help with drying and wiping up spills.

Getting these items ready saves time. It makes your cleaning session efficient. You can then focus on each step without interruption. Your GE dishwasher will thank you for the preparation. Always unplug your dishwasher before cleaning. Safety comes first.

## Cleaning the GE Dishwasher Filter: A Crucial Step

The filter is the most important part to clean. It traps food particles. If the filter clogs, your dishes come out dirty. The dishwasher might also drain slowly. Most GE dishwashers have a removable filter. You can find it at the bottom of the tub.

First, open the dishwasher door. Pull out the lower dish rack. Look at the bottom of the tub. You will see the filter assembly. GE filters often consist of two parts. There is a coarse filter and a fine filter. The coarse filter is usually a cup or cylinder. It traps larger debris. The fine filter is a mesh screen. It catches smaller particles.

To remove the filter, twist it counter-clockwise. Then, lift it out. Some models may require a slight push down before twisting. Check your GE owner's manual for exact instructions. Once removed, you will likely see trapped food. This includes rice, vegetable scraps, and even bones. These items prevent proper drainage. They cause bad smells.

Take the filter to the sink. Rinse it under warm running water. Use an old toothbrush or a small brush. Gently scrub the mesh and plastic parts. Remove all visible food debris. You can use a little dish soap if needed. Make sure to clean all crevices. Pay close attention to the fine mesh screen. Clogs here are common. If your GE dishwasher drain seems slow, a dirty filter is a likely cause. For more specific help with drainage, check out our guide on [how to clean GE dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-ge-dishwasher-drain).

After cleaning, ensure the filter is completely free of debris. Then, place it back into the dishwasher. Align it correctly. Twist it clockwise until it locks into place. It should feel secure. An improperly seated filter can cause leaks or poor cleaning. Regularly cleaning the filter prevents many common dishwasher issues. This step alone significantly improves performance. Many users find their dishwasher smells better after this cleaning. If you are wondering [how to remove GE dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-ge-dishwasher-filter) for the first time, it is usually simpler than it looks.

## Deep Cleaning the GE Dishwasher Interior

After the filter, focus on the rest of the interior. This includes the spray arms, racks, and the tub walls. These areas collect grease, soap scum, and hard water deposits. Cleaning them ensures water sprays effectively. It also prevents dirt from redepositing on your dishes.

Start with the spray arms. There are usually two: one lower, one upper. Some models have a third at the top. Check their holes. These small holes can get clogged. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear any blockages. Spin the spray arms by hand. They should spin freely. If they feel stiff, they might need deeper cleaning or replacement. If your GE dishwasher has a smell, these blocked nozzles can contribute to it. Learn more about [why your GE dishwasher smells](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-dishwasher-smell) in our dedicated article.

Next, wipe down the inside of the tub. Use a damp cloth and a mild detergent. Pay attention to the door seal. Food and mold often build up here. Pull back the rubber seal gently. Clean underneath it. This area is a common source of bad odors. A small brush can help reach tight spots.

The dish racks also need attention. Food particles can get stuck in the tines. Remove the racks. You can wash them in the sink with warm, soapy water. Check the wheels on the racks. Make sure they roll smoothly. If they are sticky or broken, they might need cleaning or replacement. When putting everything back, remember [how to put GE dishwasher back together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-ge-dishwasher-back-together) correctly to ensure proper function.

For a thorough internal clean, run an empty cycle. Place a cup of white vinegar on the top rack. Do not add detergent. Run a hot water cycle. The vinegar helps dissolve grease, soap scum, and mineral deposits. It also acts as a natural disinfectant. Alternatively, sprinkle a cup of baking soda on the bottom of the empty tub. Run a hot cycle. Baking soda also helps with odors and light stains. You can even combine both methods. Run the vinegar cycle first. Then, after that cycle finishes, sprinkle baking soda and run another short hot cycle.

## Tackling Odors and Limescale in Your GE Dishwasher

Odors and limescale are common problems for dishwashers. Odors come from trapped food and bacteria. Limescale comes from hard water. Addressing these issues makes a big difference. Your dishes will be cleaner, and your kitchen will smell better.

For odors, the primary cause is often the filter. Cleaning the filter regularly is essential. However, smells can linger in the tub itself. Baking soda is excellent for absorbing odors. Sprinkle a cup of baking soda on the bottom of the empty dishwasher. Let it sit overnight. Then, run a short hot water cycle in the morning. This simple step can refresh your appliance.

White vinegar is a powerful tool for cleaning and deodorizing. It is also very effective against limescale. Limescale appears as white, chalky deposits. These deposits can build up on heating elements, spray arms, and the tub walls. This reduces heating efficiency. It also clogs water jets. Pour two cups of white vinegar into a dishwasher-safe bowl. Place the bowl on the top rack of your empty dishwasher. Run a hot water cycle. The vinegar will circulate and dissolve the mineral buildup. This process also kills bacteria that cause odors. For a complete guide on this method, read our article on [how to clean GE dishwasher with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-ge-dishwasher-with-vinegar).

Commercial dishwasher cleaners are another option. These products contain stronger acids or enzymes. They are specifically designed to break down tough grease, food particles, and mineral deposits. Follow the product instructions carefully. Some cleaners require you to place a packet or bottle upside down in the bottom rack. Others instruct you to add liquid to the detergent dispenser. Use these cleaners monthly or quarterly. This helps maintain a fresh and limescale-free interior.

Regular use of rinse aid can also help. Rinse aid prevents water spots and helps water drain. This reduces the chance of moisture lingering. Less moisture means less mildew smell. Make sure your dishwasher's rinse aid dispenser is full. These cleaning methods help your GE dishwasher stay fresh and spotless.

## Exterior Care and Routine Maintenance for Your GE Dishwasher

Cleaning your GE dishwasher is not just about the inside. The exterior also needs attention. A clean exterior contributes to a tidy kitchen. It also prevents grime from spreading. Proper routine maintenance extends your appliance's life.

Start with the control panel and door front. Use a soft, damp cloth. Wipe away fingerprints, food splatters, and dust. For stainless steel finishes, use a specialized stainless steel cleaner. Always wipe in the direction of the grain. This prevents streaks. Do not use abrasive cleaners. They can scratch the surface. A glass cleaner works well for display screens. Spray it on your cloth first, not directly on the panel.

The door handle often gets dirty. Wipe it down with an all-purpose cleaner. Pay attention to the edges of the door. Food particles and liquids can drip here. Keep this area clean to prevent stickiness. You can also use a small brush to clean around buttons or knobs if they are recessed.

Consider the dishwasher's surroundings. Clean the floor around the dishwasher. Dust and crumbs can accumulate here. Check the area beneath the dishwasher. Look for any leaks. Even small leaks can cause significant damage over time. If you notice water, investigate the source immediately. A leaking dishwasher needs quick attention to prevent floor damage.

Routine maintenance ensures longevity. Beyond cleaning, check the water supply line and drain hose. Ensure they are free from kinks. Check for signs of wear. Regularly inspect the door gasket for cracks or tears. A damaged gasket can lead to leaks. Make sure the dishwasher door closes and latches firmly. This prevents water from escaping during a cycle. Performing these checks regularly keeps your GE dishwasher in top shape. It helps avoid unexpected problems.

## Troubleshooting Common GE Dishwasher Cleaning Issues

Sometimes, even after cleaning, issues remain. Your GE dishwasher might still smell. Dishes might still come out dirty. Or, water might not drain properly. These problems often have simple solutions. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps.

If your dishes are not clean after a wash, recheck the basics. Is the filter clean? Are the spray arm nozzles clear? Make sure dishes are loaded correctly. Overloading blocks water jets. It prevents proper cleaning. Also, check your detergent. Ensure you use fresh, high-quality detergent. Old detergent loses effectiveness.

A lingering smell often points to deeper issues. Beyond the filter, check the drain hose. Food particles can get trapped in the hose. This creates unpleasant odors. Ensure the hose has a high loop. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Sometimes, the smell comes from the garbage disposal if it is connected. Run the disposal. Then, flush it with hot water and baking soda. If the smell persists, your dishwasher might need a more intensive drain clean. For specific steps, refer to our guide on [how to get GE dishwasher to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-ge-dishwasher-to-drain).

If water is not draining, the filter is the first suspect. If the filter is clean, check the drain hose for kinks. Make sure the air gap, if you have one, is clear. An air gap prevents dirty water backflow. It can get clogged. Disassemble it and clean it. In some cases, the drain pump might be faulty. But always check the simpler solutions first.

Sometimes, issues are not about cleanliness. They might be electrical. If your GE dishwasher has no power, troubleshooting steps differ. This problem prevents any cleaning cycle from running. Our article [why my GE dishwasher has no power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-my-ge-dishwasher-has-no-power) offers specific guidance for power issues. For any issue, consulting your GE owner's manual is always a good idea. It provides model-specific troubleshooting tips. These steps empower you to resolve common cleaning-related problems quickly.
