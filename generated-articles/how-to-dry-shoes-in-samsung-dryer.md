## Safely Drying Shoes in Your Samsung Dryer

Wet shoes are a common problem. We all get caught in the rain or simply need to wash our favorite sneakers. Drying them can be a challenge. Air drying takes a long time, and some people wonder about using their appliance. Many wonder if they can use their Samsung dryer.

Drying shoes in a Samsung dryer is possible. However, you need to follow specific steps. This ensures both your shoes and your dryer remain safe. This guide will walk you through the proper way to dry shoes. You will learn about preparing your shoes, using the right settings, and important safety tips.

### Takeaway:

*   Always use a dryer rack or tie shoes to the door.
*   Select low heat or air fluff settings.
*   Remove laces and insoles before drying.
*   Add towels to cushion noise and provide balance.

Drying shoes in a Samsung dryer is safe when you use the correct method, primarily with a dryer rack or by securely tying them to the dryer door, and always select a low heat or air-only cycle to prevent damage to the footwear and the appliance.

### Is It Safe to Dry Shoes in a Samsung Dryer?

Drying shoes in a Samsung dryer can be safe. However, you must take proper precautions. Simply tossing shoes into the drum can cause problems. It can damage your shoes and even the dryer itself.

The tumbling action can be harsh on footwear. It can also create a lot of noise. This noise comes from the shoes banging against the drum. Over time, this constant impact might cause wear and tear to the dryer components. Moreover, high heat settings pose a risk. High heat can shrink or melt certain shoe materials. It can also weaken the glues that hold shoes together. Therefore, careful handling is key to a successful and safe drying process.

Using a dryer rack is the safest method. This accessory keeps shoes stationary inside the drum. It prevents them from tumbling around. If you do not have a rack, there are other ways to dry shoes more safely. These methods aim to reduce impact and heat exposure. Knowing these methods helps protect your investment. It also helps your appliance last longer.

You should always be aware of your dryer's performance. If your dryer seems to take longer to dry than usual, even for regular laundry, there might be an underlying issue. Sometimes, improper loading or vent blockages can slow down drying times. Checking these things helps your dryer run better. If you notice your dryer taking an unusual amount of time, you might want to investigate why your [Samsung dryer takes so long to dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-samsung-dryer-take-so-long-to-dry).

### Essential Preparations Before Drying Shoes

Proper preparation is vital before you dry shoes in your Samsung dryer. Skipping these steps can lead to damaged shoes. It can also lead to problems with your appliance. The first step is to clean your shoes. Remove any loose dirt, mud, or debris from the outside. This prevents dirt from getting inside your dryer.

Next, remove the laces from your shoes. Laces can get tangled during the drying cycle. They can also get caught in the dryer drum. This can damage both the laces and the dryer. You should also remove any insoles or inserts. These items often dry at different rates. Drying them separately ensures they get completely dry. It also prevents them from trapping moisture inside the shoe.

Consider placing your shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. A sturdy pillowcase also works well. This offers an extra layer of protection. It helps contain any small parts that might detach. It also reduces the direct impact of the shoes on the dryer drum. This cushioning is important.

Finally, add a few large, dry towels to the dryer drum. These towels serve multiple purposes. They help absorb some of the moisture from the shoes. They also provide cushioning. This significantly reduces the banging noise the shoes make. The towels help balance the load. This prevents the dryer from shaking excessively. When you want to dry shoes, starting with clean footwear is always a good idea.

### Using a Samsung Dryer Rack for Shoe Drying

Using a dryer rack is the best method for drying shoes in a Samsung dryer. Many Samsung dryer models come with a rack. You can also purchase one as an accessory. A dryer rack fits inside the dryer drum. It stays stationary while the drum rotates around it. This prevents your shoes from tumbling.

To use a dryer rack, first, open your dryer door. Locate the slots or grooves on the inside of the dryer drum. These are usually near the front or back. Slide the dryer rack into these slots. Make sure it is secure and stable. The rack should not wobble or move freely.

Once the rack is in place, position your shoes on top of it. Lay them flat. Make sure they are not overlapping. This allows air to circulate freely around each shoe. This helps them dry more evenly and efficiently. You can usually fit one or two pairs of shoes on a rack. Avoid overloading the rack. Overloading can block airflow. It can also cause the rack to become unstable.

The dryer rack is excellent for delicate shoes. It also works well for shoes that might lose their shape. Since there is no tumbling, the shoes retain their form. This method minimizes wear and tear on your footwear. It also protects the dryer from impact damage. Many people find this method simple and effective. It makes drying shoes much safer. While this article focuses on Samsung dryers, other brands also offer similar solutions. For example, if you have an Electrolux dryer, you can find information on [how to dry shoes in an Electrolux dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-dry-shoes-in-electrolux-dryer) which might offer similar insights on using a rack.

### Optimal Samsung Dryer Settings for Shoes

Choosing the right settings on your Samsung dryer is crucial for drying shoes safely. High heat can cause irreversible damage. It can melt glues, shrink materials, or warp shoe shapes. Always opt for the lowest heat setting available. This helps protect your footwear.

Look for specific cycles on your Samsung dryer. The "Air Fluff" or "Air Dry" setting is ideal. This cycle uses no heat at all. It simply circulates room temperature air. While it takes longer, it is the safest option. It minimizes any risk of heat damage. This setting is perfect for most types of athletic shoes or canvas shoes.

If your dryer does not have an "Air Fluff" setting, choose "Delicate" or "Low Heat." These settings use minimal heat. They still provide enough warmth to aid in drying. Monitor your shoes closely when using any heat setting. Feel them occasionally to check their temperature. You want them to be warm to the touch, not hot.

Avoid using "Sensor Dry" cycles for shoes. These cycles use moisture sensors to determine when clothes are dry. Shoes, especially if placed on a rack, might not tumble enough to activate these sensors correctly. This could lead to the dryer shutting off too early. It might also cause the shoes to remain damp. Instead, use a "Timed Dry" cycle. Start with a shorter duration, like 20-30 minutes. Then, check the shoes and add more time if needed. This gives you better control over the drying process. Sometimes, you might wonder if your dryer will automatically stop when shoes are dry. It's good to know how your dryer works generally. For example, understanding if your [Samsung dryer stops when clothes are dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-samsung-dryer-stop-when-clothes-are-dry) can help manage your expectations for shoes.

### Drying Shoes Without a Samsung Dryer Rack

What if you do not have a Samsung dryer rack? You can still dry shoes in your dryer. This method requires extra care. It is not as gentle as using a rack. However, it can work in a pinch. You must prevent the shoes from tumbling freely.

The most common technique is to tie your shoes together. Use the shoelaces to form a knot. Then, secure the knotted end to the inside of the dryer door. Some people tie the laces to the dryer handle. Others use the top edge of the dryer door. Make sure the shoes hang inside the drum. They should not touch the dryer's heating element. Their weight should be supported by the door.

Next, add several large, dry towels to the dryer drum. These towels serve two main purposes. They absorb moisture from the shoes. They also act as a buffer. The towels cushion the shoes against the drum. This reduces the banging noise. It also helps prevent damage to both the shoes and the dryer. The towels should be heavy enough to provide good padding.

Always use a low heat or air-only setting. Just like with a dryer rack, high heat is a hazard. Monitor the shoes closely during the cycle. Check them every 15-20 minutes. You want to ensure they are drying evenly. Also, make sure they are not getting too hot. This method carries a higher risk of noise and potential damage. It is always better to use a dryer rack if possible. However, this is a workable alternative when a rack is not available.

### Post-Drying Steps and Checks

Once the dryer cycle finishes, your work is not quite done. There are a few important post-drying steps. These steps ensure your shoes are fully dry. They also help maintain their quality. First, immediately remove the shoes from the dryer. Leaving them inside can trap any remaining moisture. This might lead to odors or mildew.

Carefully inspect each shoe. Feel the inside and outside. Pay close attention to thicker areas, like the sole and toe box. These areas often take longer to dry. If any part feels even slightly damp, do not wear the shoes yet. Wearing damp shoes can cause discomfort. It can also lead to foot issues.

If your shoes are still damp, do not put them back in the dryer for another full cycle. Instead, consider air drying them. Place them in a well-ventilated area. A fan can speed up the process. You can also stuff them with newspaper. The newspaper will absorb moisture. Replace the newspaper every few hours. This ensures complete dryness.

Once your shoes are thoroughly dry, reinsert the insoles. Put the laces back in. If your shoes feel a little stiff, wearing them usually helps. For any lingering odors, you can sprinkle baking soda inside. Let it sit overnight, then shake it out. Following these steps ensures your shoes are ready to wear. They will also stay in good condition longer. If you find your dryer isn't performing as expected even with these methods, and you observe it turning off prematurely, it might be an indication of another issue.

### When to Avoid Using Your Samsung Dryer for Shoes

While a Samsung dryer can dry many types of shoes, some materials are not suitable for machine drying. Putting the wrong shoes in the dryer can ruin them. It can also cause problems for your appliance. Knowing which shoes to avoid is essential.

Avoid drying shoes made of delicate materials. Leather and suede are prime examples. Heat can cause leather to crack, shrink, or become stiff. Suede can lose its texture and color. Shoes with intricate designs or embellishments also pose a risk. Beads, sequins, or delicate stitching can melt or detach. These small pieces can then get caught in the dryer's components. This can cause damage to the machine.

Shoes with a lot of glue are another no-go. High heat can weaken the adhesives. This can cause soles to separate from the upper part of the shoe. Certain synthetic materials, like those found in some running shoes, can also warp or melt. Always check the shoe's care label if it has one. If it says "air dry only" or has a "do not tumble dry" symbol, respect that warning.

For these types of shoes, air drying is the best option. Place them in a warm, dry spot. A sunny window sill or near a fan works well. You can stuff them with crumpled newspaper to absorb moisture. This also helps them retain their shape. Patience is key with air drying. It might take a day or two, but it prevents damage. Always prioritize the longevity of your shoes and the safety of your dryer. If you are ever in doubt, air dry your shoes.
