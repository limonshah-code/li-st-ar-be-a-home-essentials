## Unpacking Kenmore: Is Your Refrigerator Made by Whirlpool?

Have you ever wondered who truly makes your Kenmore refrigerator? Many appliance brands operate differently than you might expect. When you buy a Kenmore appliance, it is common to question its origins. This is a common point of curiosity for many homeowners. We often think of specific companies making everything they sell.

However, the appliance industry has a unique structure. Kenmore is a prime example of this model. This article will explain the relationship between Kenmore and manufacturers like Whirlpool. We will cover how Kenmore functions as a brand. You will learn how to identify the actual maker of your Kenmore unit. This guide also explores the impact on parts and service.

### Takeaway

*   Kenmore is a brand, not a manufacturer.
*   Various companies produce Kenmore appliances.
*   Whirlpool has been a significant manufacturer for Kenmore.
*   Your specific Kenmore refrigerator model determines its maker.
*   Check the model number tag for manufacturing codes.

Kenmore refrigerators are not made by Kenmore itself, as Kenmore is a brand name. Instead, various appliance manufacturers produce Kenmore refrigerators under contract. Whirlpool has been a major supplier for many Kenmore refrigerator models over the years. This means your Kenmore refrigerator could indeed be made by Whirlpool.

### The Kenmore Brand Story: What is Kenmore?

Kenmore holds a long history in American homes. It started as a brand of Sears, Roebuck and Co. Sears did not build its own appliances. Instead, Sears partnered with other manufacturers. They bought products from these companies and put the Kenmore name on them. This business model allows Kenmore to offer a wide range of products.

Kenmore sells many types of home appliances. This includes refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens. The brand emphasizes affordability and reliability. Over the decades, Kenmore became a trusted name. People recognized Kenmore for its value. The quality often matched products from the actual manufacturers.

Today, Transformco owns the Kenmore brand. Transformco continues the original business model. They license the Kenmore name. Different companies produce appliances for Kenmore. This means a Kenmore refrigerator may come from different factories. The brand maintains consistent design and quality standards.

This approach offers benefits to consumers. It allows Kenmore to adapt to market changes quickly. They can source the best features from different manufacturers. This also means parts availability can vary. Understanding this model helps you make informed decisions.

### Whirlpool's Role in Appliance Manufacturing

Whirlpool Corporation is a global leader in home appliances. They own many well-known brands. These include Maytag, KitchenAid, JennAir, and Amana. Whirlpool also acts as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This means they produce appliances for other brands.

Whirlpool has a strong reputation for its refrigerators. Their products feature innovative cooling systems and designs. They build durable appliances. Many people trust the Whirlpool name for quality. Whirlpool's extensive manufacturing facilities allow them to produce a high volume of units.

For many years, Whirlpool was a primary supplier for Kenmore. They manufactured many Kenmore refrigerator models. This partnership was beneficial for both companies. Kenmore gained access to high-quality manufacturing. Whirlpool expanded its production volume and reach. This historical connection often leads people to assume all Kenmore refrigerators are made by Whirlpool.

Whirlpool's expertise covers various refrigerator types. They produce side-by-side, French door, and top-freezer models. When Whirlpool made Kenmore units, they incorporated their core technologies. This included their compressors and cooling systems. This made many Kenmore units perform like Whirlpool-branded ones. If you have an older Kenmore refrigerator, there is a good chance Whirlpool made it.

### The OEM Relationship: Kenmore and its Suppliers

Kenmore's business model relies heavily on OEM relationships. An OEM is a company that makes parts or products for another company. Kenmore contracts with various OEMs to produce their appliances. This allows Kenmore to avoid building its own factories. They can focus on brand management and sales.

Over time, Kenmore has partnered with a wide range of manufacturers. Besides Whirlpool, these include LG, Electrolux, and Samsung. General Electric (GE) has also supplied Kenmore appliances. The specific manufacturer can change over time. It depends on various factors. These include production capacity, cost, and technology.

This diverse supplier base impacts Kenmore products. Different manufacturers bring their unique technologies. For example, an LG-made Kenmore refrigerator might feature LG's specific cooling system. A Whirlpool-made Kenmore might use Whirlpool's proprietary features. This diversity can be a strength. It allows Kenmore to offer a broad range of features.

For you, the consumer, this means understanding your specific model. Knowing the actual manufacturer helps with maintenance. It also helps with troubleshooting and parts replacement. Sometimes, finding parts for a Kenmore refrigerator means looking for parts from the original manufacturer.

Consider an example: you might have an older Kenmore side-by-side refrigerator. If Whirlpool made it, its internal components might be similar to a Whirlpool branded unit. This knowledge helps you when troubleshooting common issues like cooling problems.

### Identifying Your Kenmore Refrigerator's Manufacturer

Knowing the actual manufacturer of your Kenmore refrigerator is useful. It helps with parts, repairs, and understanding features. The key to identifying the manufacturer lies in the model number tag. Every Kenmore appliance has a tag. This tag includes the model and serial numbers.

Look for a small label inside your refrigerator. It is often located on an interior wall, near the top, or behind a kick plate. Some labels are on the outside back of the unit. The model number starts with a three-digit prefix. This prefix indicates the manufacturer. For instance, a model number starting with "106" typically indicates Whirlpool made the unit.

Here are some common prefixes and their corresponding manufacturers:

*   **106, 198, 596, 620, 683, 970:** Whirlpool
*   **795:** LG
*   **253:** Electrolux (Frigidaire)
*   **363:** General Electric (GE)
*   **401:** Samsung

Once you find this prefix, you know the original manufacturer. This information is important for several reasons. When you need a replacement part, you can often search for the part using the original manufacturer's name. This helps in securing the correct component. [How to tell which Kenmore refrigerator I have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-which-kenmore-refrigerator-i-have) offers more details on locating this information.

Additionally, knowing the manufacturer assists with troubleshooting. The service manual for a Whirlpool-made Kenmore might be similar to a Whirlpool branded one. This helps you understand common problems and solutions. For instance, if your Kenmore refrigerator keeps freezing up, the solution might be found in Whirlpool's common fixes.

### Impact on Performance, Parts, and Service

The manufacturer of your Kenmore refrigerator impacts its performance. Each company uses its own technologies and designs. This affects how efficient the refrigerator is. It also determines how well it cools food. The overall user experience can differ based on the OEM.

Parts availability is another significant aspect. When you need a replacement part for your Kenmore refrigerator, knowing the manufacturer is key. Many parts are specific to the original manufacturer. A compressor from a Whirlpool-made Kenmore will likely be a Whirlpool component. A fan motor from an LG-made unit will be an LG part. This means you might need to search for "Whirlpool refrigerator parts" rather than just "Kenmore refrigerator parts" for specific components.

Service and repairs also depend on the manufacturer. Many independent technicians are familiar with common brands like Whirlpool or LG. If they know your Kenmore unit is from Whirlpool, they can use their Whirlpool repair knowledge. This often speeds up diagnosis and repair time. Warranty coverage also relates to the original manufacturer in some cases.

It is important to keep your model and serial numbers handy. This helps when calling for service or ordering parts. You can often find generic Kenmore parts. However, critical components usually trace back to the actual manufacturer. [How to change filter in Kenmore refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-filter-in-kenmore-refrigerator) is an example of a common task where knowing the filter type (often specific to the manufacturer's design) is crucial.

Proper maintenance also varies slightly. For example, cleaning the coils under your refrigerator might have specific instructions based on the OEM's design.

### Benefits of Diverse Manufacturing for Kenmore Owners

Kenmore's strategy of using multiple manufacturers offers several advantages. First, it allows Kenmore to provide a vast product selection. They can offer various models and price points. This caters to a wide range of consumer needs and budgets. You can find basic models or feature-rich options.

Second, this approach fosters competition among suppliers. Kenmore can choose the best technology and value. This means Kenmore appliances can incorporate cutting-edge features. It can also lead to competitive pricing for consumers. You might get advanced features at a more accessible price.

Third, it provides flexibility in the supply chain. If one manufacturer faces production issues, Kenmore can shift orders. This helps maintain product availability. It reduces the risk of long delays for consumers. This also means the brand is not reliant on a single company for its product line.

Finally, consumers benefit from diverse engineering. Each manufacturer has its strengths. Whirlpool is known for durability. LG excels in innovative design and smart features. Electrolux often focuses on energy efficiency. When you buy a Kenmore, you get to choose from a variety of these strengths.

This diversified model allows Kenmore to be agile. It means they can quickly adapt to new trends. They can also offer unique products. My experience shows that this keeps the Kenmore brand relevant. It ensures they remain a strong option in the competitive appliance market.

### Purchasing a Kenmore Refrigerator Today

Buying a Kenmore refrigerator today is different than in the past. Sears stores were once the primary sellers. Now, Kenmore products are available through various retailers. You can find them online and in some appliance stores. This broader availability makes it easier to purchase Kenmore units.

When considering a Kenmore refrigerator, research the specific model. Look for the manufacturer's prefix in the model number. This gives you insight into its origins. Check reviews for that specific model. Reviews often highlight performance and reliability. Consider energy efficiency ratings.

Understand the warranty terms. Kenmore generally offers its own warranty. However, service might be performed by technicians familiar with the OEM's products. Ask about parts availability before purchase if this is a concern. My advice is to always read the fine print.

Kenmore continues to offer a range of refrigerator types. You can find French door, side-by-side, and top-freezer models. They also offer different finishes and capacities. Consider your household needs. Think about space, family size, and preferred features. For example, if you need a lot of ice, investigate the ice maker's performance. [How to get my Kenmore refrigerator to make ice](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-my-kenmore-refrigerator-to-make-ice) provides useful tips for ice production.

Finally, compare prices. Kenmore aims for value. You might find a Kenmore model with similar features to a brand-name appliance but at a lower cost. This makes Kenmore an attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. Always ensure you are comfortable with the purchase terms.
