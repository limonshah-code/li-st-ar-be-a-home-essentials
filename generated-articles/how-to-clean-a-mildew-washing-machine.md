## Banish Bad Odors: How To Clean A Mildew Washing Machine

Have you ever pulled freshly washed laundry from your machine, only to find it smells less than fresh? That damp, musty odor often signals one culprit: mildew. A mildew washing machine is a common problem for many households. It can make your clothes smell bad, even after a full cycle. You want your laundry to smell clean. I understand how frustrating this issue can be. This guide provides clear, actionable steps to thoroughly clean your washing machine. We will eliminate mildew and prevent its return.

We will discuss why mildew grows in your machine. You will learn about the best cleaning products. We cover methods for both front-load and top-load washers. We also provide tips for future prevention. This article gives you a fresh-smelling machine and sparkling clean clothes. Let's get your washer back to its best state.

### Takeaway: Restore Your Washer's Freshness
*   **Understand Causes:** Mildew thrives in damp, dark places like your washer.
*   **Gather Supplies:** You will need vinegar, baking soda, bleach, and cleaning tools.
*   **Target Specifics:** Clean gaskets, detergent dispensers, and the tub.

To clean a mildew washing machine, run an empty hot water cycle with two cups of white vinegar and half a cup of baking soda. Next, scrub all accessible parts like the detergent dispenser and door gasket with a vinegar solution. Follow with a second hot water rinse. This removes residues and odors.

## Understanding Mildew in Your Washing Machine: Why it Happens

You might wonder why your washing machine starts to smell musty. Mildew is a type of fungus. It grows well in damp, warm, and dark environments. Your washing machine provides these ideal conditions. Water often stays trapped in parts of the machine after a cycle. This constant moisture is the main reason for mildew growth.

Front-load washers are especially prone to mildew. Their rubber door gaskets seal tightly. This keeps water inside. Water can pool in the folds of the gasket. This creates a perfect breeding ground for mold and mildew spores. Top-load washers can also develop mildew. Water might sit in the tub or dispenser trays. Using too much detergent also contributes. Excess suds create residue. This residue traps moisture and dirt. It offers more food for mildew. If you wash clothes with mildew, the spores can transfer to the machine, starting a new cycle of growth. This is similar to how mildew can spread to other areas. If you've ever dealt with [mildew on clothes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mildew-from-clothes), you know how persistent it can be.

The problem often begins subtly. You might first notice a slight damp smell on your clothes. Over time, the smell becomes stronger. You may see black or pinkish growth. This growth appears on the gasket, dispenser, or even inside the drum. This indicates a significant mildew problem. Regular cleaning prevents these issues from becoming severe. Addressing the problem quickly keeps your machine healthy. Ignoring it only makes the smell worse. It can even affect your laundry.

Sometimes, the issue is not just the visible mildew. The odor can come from hidden areas. These areas include hoses or pumps. These parts are hard to reach. They also trap water and detergent residue. Understanding these causes helps you clean more effectively. It also allows you to prevent future problems. You are not alone if you have this problem. Many people ask, "Why does my GE washing machine smell like mildew?" This is a very common issue across all brands.

## Essential Tools and Solutions for Mildew Removal

Cleaning your mildew washing machine requires the right supplies. You do not need many special tools. Most items are likely already in your home. Having everything ready makes the cleaning process smoother. I find it helps to gather everything before I start. This saves time and effort.

First, you will need a good cleaning agent. White distilled vinegar is excellent for mildew. It is a natural disinfectant. It breaks down mineral deposits and kills mold spores. Baking soda is another fantastic option. It acts as a natural deodorizer. It also gently scrubs away grime. Together, vinegar and baking soda form a powerful cleaning duo. They create a fizzing reaction. This helps to loosen stubborn buildup.

Next, consider using bleach for tough mildew. Bleach is a strong disinfectant. It kills mold and whitens surfaces. However, use bleach with caution. Never mix bleach with vinegar. This creates dangerous chlorine gas. Always ventilate the area well when using bleach. Some people prefer commercial washing machine cleaners. These products are specifically designed for this purpose. They often contain enzymes or other chemicals to break down residue and kill odors. These cleaners are a convenient option. You can find options for [what to put in a washing machine to clean it](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-to-put-in-a-washing-machine-to-clean-it) that suit your needs.

You will also need a few basic cleaning tools. A spray bottle helps apply vinegar solution. Old rags or microfiber cloths are useful for wiping surfaces. An old toothbrush or a small scrubbing brush gets into tight spots. A bucket can be helpful for mixing solutions. Rubber gloves protect your hands from cleaning agents. Finally, have some clean towels ready. These help dry the machine parts after cleaning. Gathering these simple items prepares you for a successful cleaning session.

| Cleaning Agent | Purpose | Application | Caution |
| :------------- | :------ | :---------- | :------ |
| **White Vinegar** | Disinfects, deodorizes, breaks down mineral deposits, kills mold. | Use in cycles, spray on surfaces, scrub. | Do not mix with bleach. |
| **Baking Soda** | Deodorizes, gentle abrasive, boosts cleaning power. | Add to cycles, mix into paste for scrubbing. | Safe to use with vinegar. |
| **Bleach** | Strong disinfectant, kills mold, whitens. | Use in cycles (check machine guidelines), spray on specific areas. | NEVER mix with vinegar or other cleaners. Use in well-ventilated area. |
| **Commercial Washer Cleaners** | Formulated for specific machine cleaning, enzyme-based. | Follow product instructions for cycle or wiping. | Check compatibility with machine type. |

## Deep Cleaning Your Front-Load Washer Gasket and Door

Front-load washing machines often develop mildew around the rubber gasket. This gasket creates a watertight seal. It prevents leaks during the wash cycle. However, water and detergent residue get trapped in its folds. This creates a perfect environment for mildew to thrive. Cleaning this area is crucial for eliminating odors.

### Tackle the Gasket

Start by opening the washer door wide. Inspect the rubber gasket thoroughly. You will likely see dark spots or a slimy residue. Pull back the folds of the gasket. Look for hidden grime. I often find the worst buildup here. You need a cleaning solution for this part. Mix equal parts white vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. Spray the entire gasket, inside and out. Let the solution sit for 5-10 minutes. This helps loosen the mildew.

Next, take an old rag or a microfiber cloth. Begin wiping away the grime. You will need to put some effort into this. Use a small brush or an old toothbrush for stubborn areas. These tools help reach into tight crevices. Scrub until all visible mildew is gone. You may need to reapply the vinegar solution. After scrubbing, wipe the gasket dry with a clean towel. Drying is very important. Leaving moisture encourages mildew to return. Pay close attention to this step.

If the mildew is severe, consider a bleach solution. Mix one part bleach with one part water. Apply it to the gasket. Let it sit for about 10 minutes. Then, wipe it clean. Remember, never mix bleach and vinegar. Always use rubber gloves when handling bleach. Ensure good ventilation. Thoroughly rinse the area with clean water afterward. Then dry it completely.

### Clean the Detergent Dispenser

The detergent dispenser tray is another common spot for mildew. Water can sit here. Leftover detergent or fabric softener creates a sticky film. This film is food for mildew. Pull out the dispenser drawer if your machine allows it. Many front-load machines have removable dispensers. Rinse it under warm water.

You might see black or pinkish mold inside the dispenser. Use your vinegar solution or a bit of dish soap. Scrub all compartments with a brush or sponge. Pay attention to corners and edges. Sometimes, mildew grows inside the dispenser housing itself. This is the part where the drawer slides in. Use your spray bottle to spray vinegar solution into this area. Let it sit, then wipe it with a cloth. Use a toothbrush to reach deep inside. After cleaning, rinse the drawer thoroughly. Then let it air dry completely before putting it back.

By cleaning these key areas, you address the primary sources of mildew in front-load washers. This stops the smell at its source. It also makes your machine more hygienic.

## Effective Cleaning for Top-Load Washer Tubs and Components

Top-load washing machines have a different design than front-loaders. This means they accumulate mildew in different areas. While they generally have fewer issues with door gaskets, the tub itself and other components can become problematic. Understanding these differences helps in thorough cleaning. You want to make sure your machine is clean and smells fresh.

### Tub Cleaning Methods

The main tub of a top-load washer is often where mildew starts. Stagnant water, lint, and detergent residue combine to create a musty environment. I recommend performing a deep clean cycle for the tub. Start by ensuring the washer is empty. Set your machine to the hottest water setting available. Choose the largest load size.

For a natural cleaning solution, add two cups of white distilled vinegar directly to the washer tub. Close the lid and let the machine fill with hot water. Once it's full, pause the cycle. Let the vinegar water soak for at least one hour, or even longer. This allows the vinegar to penetrate and kill mildew spores. After soaking, restart the cycle. Let it run to completion. This rinses away the loosened grime and mildew.

For a tougher clean, or if the mildew smell persists, you can use baking soda. After the vinegar cycle, add half a cup of baking soda to the empty tub. Run another full hot water cycle. Baking soda helps neutralize odors and provides a gentle scrubbing action. Remember, never mix vinegar and baking soda at the same time in the same cycle. Use them in separate cycles. This ensures they work effectively without creating a fizzing reaction that could be excessive.

Alternatively, some people prefer using bleach for the tub. Add one cup of liquid chlorine bleach to the detergent dispenser or directly to the tub. Run a hot water cycle without any clothes. Do not pause this cycle. Allow it to run fully. Bleach is very effective at killing mildew. Always ensure good ventilation when using bleach. Follow this with a rinse cycle to remove any bleach residue. This prevents it from coming into contact with your clothes later.

### Agitator and Inner Drum Care

The agitator, the central pole in many top-load washers, can also harbor mildew. Water and residue get trapped around its base or in crevices. The inner drum also collects soap scum and grime. For agitator models, remove the fabric softener dispenser if it's on top of the agitator. Clean it separately with warm water and vinegar. Use an old toothbrush to scrub around the base of the agitator. Reach into any grooves.

For machines without an agitator, focus on the inner sides of the drum. Use a spray bottle filled with your vinegar solution. Spray down the entire inside of the tub. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Then, wipe it down with a clean cloth. For stubborn areas, a non-scratch scrub pad can be helpful. Pay attention to the top rim of the tub. Water often splashes and sits there. This area is a common spot for mildew growth.

Regular maintenance is key for top-loaders. After each wash, leave the lid open for a while. This allows the tub to air dry. Wiping down the drum and agitator after your cleaning cycle helps too. These simple steps keep mildew from returning. A clean tub means clean clothes.

## Running a Powerful Washer Cleaning Cycle

After cleaning the visible parts of your washing machine, it is time for a deep cleaning cycle. This cycle flushes out hidden mildew and residues from the internal components. It reaches areas you cannot scrub by hand. This step is vital for truly eliminating the musty odor. You have options for what to use in this cycle.

### Vinegar and Baking Soda Method

This natural approach is effective and safe for most machines. Start with an empty washing machine. Add two cups of white distilled vinegar to the detergent dispenser or directly into the tub. Set the washer to the hottest water setting. Choose the largest load size. If your machine has a "Tub Clean" or "Self Clean" cycle, use that. Otherwise, run a regular heavy-duty cycle.

Once the cycle finishes, open the lid or door. Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda into the tub. Run another hot water cycle immediately. Do not add more vinegar. Baking soda works best as a separate step. It neutralizes any remaining odors. It also helps to gently scrub away residue. This dual approach ensures a thorough clean without harsh chemicals. It is a good option if you want to avoid bleach.

### Bleach Cleaning Method

Bleach is a powerful disinfectant. It kills stubborn mildew and mold. This method is often preferred for very strong odors. Add one cup of liquid chlorine bleach to the detergent dispenser. Alternatively, pour it directly into the tub. Again, ensure the machine is empty. Select the hottest water setting. Choose the largest load size. Run a full wash cycle.

It is crucial to never mix bleach with vinegar. This combination creates toxic chlorine gas. Always use bleach in a well-ventilated area. After the bleach cycle, run an additional plain rinse cycle. This removes any lingering bleach residue. This prevents damage to your clothes in future washes. This extra rinse is very important. I always run it to be safe. You don't want bleach to accidentally stain your next load of laundry.

### Commercial Washer Cleaners

Many brands offer specialized washing machine cleaning tablets or liquids. These products are formulated to tackle mildew, soap scum, and hard water deposits. They often contain enzymes or other chemicals for a deep clean. Some popular options include Affresh, OxiClean, or Tide Washing Machine Cleaner.

To use a commercial cleaner, simply follow the package directions. Typically, you add the cleaner to an empty machine. You then run a hot water cycle. Some products require you to use the "Tub Clean" cycle. These cleaners are convenient. They can be very effective, especially for ongoing maintenance. Choose a product that is compatible with your machine type. This ensures the best results.

Regardless of the method you choose, a powerful cleaning cycle is essential. It flushes out the hidden grime. This helps eliminate the musty smell from the source. Your clothes will come out smelling fresh.

## Don't Forget These: Filters, Hoses, and Exterior

Cleaning your washing machine involves more than just the tub and gasket. Several other parts can harbor mildew or contribute to the problem. These often overlooked components play a significant role in your machine's overall hygiene. Ignoring them means the mildew problem might persist or quickly return.

First, consider the **drain pump filter**. Many front-load washers have a small access panel at the bottom. Behind this panel, you will find a filter. This filter catches lint, coins, and other small items. It often traps stagnant water and can become very smelly. Check your owner's manual for instructions on how to access and clean it. Place a shallow pan or towel under the filter opening. This catches any water that drains out. Carefully unscrew the filter. Remove any debris. Rinse the filter under running water. Use an old toothbrush to clean any gunk. Wipe the housing clean. Then, replace the filter securely. Cleaning this regularly prevents odors and improves drainage.

Next, think about the **hoses**. The hoses connect your machine to the water supply and drainage system. While you cannot clean the inside of the hoses easily, you can inspect them. Check for any kinks or blockages in the drain hose. A kinked hose can prevent proper drainage. This leaves water in the machine. This contributes to mildew. Ensure hoses are properly installed. Make sure they allow free flow of water. If you notice any signs of mold on the *exterior* of the hoses, wipe them down with a vinegar solution.

The **exterior** of your washing machine also needs attention. Spilled detergent or fabric softener can drip down the sides. Dust and grime collect on the surface. These create a sticky film. Wipe down the entire exterior of your machine. Use a mild all-purpose cleaner or your vinegar solution. Pay attention to control knobs and the top surface. A clean exterior contributes to a fresh-smelling laundry area. It also prevents mildew from developing on outer surfaces.

Finally, consider the **lint filter** in some top-load washers. Some older top-loaders have a separate, removable lint filter. If your machine has one, make sure to clean it regularly. Trapped lint, especially if damp, can quickly become moldy. Consult your manual to locate and clean this filter. Cleaning these additional components ensures a truly comprehensive clean. It helps keep your entire washing machine system free from mildew and unpleasant odors.

## Preventing Future Mildew Growth: Simple Habits for a Fresh Washer

Cleaning a mildew washing machine thoroughly is important. But prevention is key to keeping it fresh long-term. Small changes in your routine make a big difference. These habits stop mildew before it starts. I find these tips help maintain a fresh-smelling laundry room.

First, **leave the washer door or lid open** after each use. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps the interior dry completely. Mildew cannot grow without moisture. For front-load washers, I usually leave the door ajar for several hours, or even overnight. For top-loaders, simply keeping the lid up is enough. This simple step is one of the most effective prevention methods.

Second, **wipe down the gasket and dispenser** after every few washes. For front-load machines, give the rubber door gasket a quick wipe. Use a clean, dry cloth. This removes any trapped water and detergent residue. Do the same for the detergent dispenser. This prevents buildup. This habit takes less than a minute. It saves you from more intensive cleaning later.

Third, **use the correct amount of detergent**. Many people use too much detergent. Excess detergent creates too many suds. These suds leave a sticky residue inside the machine. This residue is food for mildew. Refer to your detergent's instructions. Adjust the amount based on your water hardness and load size. High-efficiency (HE) machines require specific HE detergents. These detergents produce fewer suds. They are designed to work with less water. This helps prevent residue buildup.

Fourth, **remove wet laundry promptly**. Do not leave wet clothes in the washer for long periods. This creates a very damp environment. It encourages mildew to grow on your clothes and inside the machine. Transfer clothes to the dryer as soon as the cycle finishes. If you forget, re-run the rinse cycle. Then transfer them. This prevents mildew from taking hold. If your clothes smell musty, you might need to address [how to get mildew out of outdoor carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-mildew-out-of-outdoor-carpet) on other items if the problem is widespread.

Finally, **run a "Tub Clean" cycle monthly**. Many modern washing machines have a self-cleaning cycle. Use this feature regularly. If your machine does not have one, run an empty hot water cycle with vinegar or a commercial washer cleaner. This routine maintenance flushes out any developing mildew or residue. It keeps your machine in top condition. By adopting these habits, you ensure your washing machine remains fresh and clean. This prevents those unpleasant mildew odors from returning.
