### How to tell if a heating element is bad in a dishwasher?

You can tell if a dishwasher heating element is bad by observing common symptoms. These include dishes not drying, water remaining cold, or a burning smell. Further diagnosis involves visually inspecting the element for damage. You can also use a multimeter to test its electrical continuity.

## Understanding Your Dishwasher's Heating Element

Every dishwasher relies on a heating element for proper operation. This metal coil sits at the bottom of the wash tub. It has two main jobs. First, it heats the water to the correct temperature during wash cycles. Hot water helps detergent work better and sanitizes your dishes. Second, it helps dry your dishes. After the final rinse, the element heats the air inside the dishwasher. This process evaporates water from the dishes.

The heating element must work correctly for your dishwasher to clean and dry effectively. It is a critical part of the cleaning process. Many modern dishwashers, like those from Bosch, use different heating methods. However, the goal remains the same: hot water and dry dishes. If your dishes come out dirty or wet, the heating element is a good place to start looking for problems.

Knowing where the element is and what it does helps you diagnose issues. It looks like a round, thin metal rod. It stretches across the bottom of the tub. This simple component does heavy work with every wash. Its failure impacts your dishwasher's core functions. It is important to understand its role. This helps you grasp why symptoms appear when it fails. When you understand its function, troubleshooting becomes easier. Many people wonder, [does Bosch dishwasher have heating element?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-bosch-dishwasher-have-heating-element) While some Bosch models use flow-through heaters, the principle of heating water and aiding drying is consistent across most dishwashers.

## Common Signs of a Malfunctioning Heating Element

A failing heating element often gives clear signals. Paying attention to these signs helps you catch the problem early. The most common sign is dishes that remain wet after a full cycle. Your dishwasher should dry dishes almost completely. If they are dripping or spotty, the heating element might not be heating the air for drying. This is a very frustrating problem for many homeowners.

Another major indicator is cold water during the wash cycle. You should hear the dishwasher heating the water. The water inside should feel hot if you pause the cycle and carefully check. If the water remains cool, the element is not working. This means your detergent will not dissolve well. Your dishes will not get properly sanitized. They might come out dirty or greasy.

You might also notice error codes on your dishwasher's display. Different brands use various codes. These codes often point to heating circuit issues. Check your dishwasher's user manual for a list of specific error codes. Sometimes, a burning smell comes from the dishwasher during operation. This smell can happen if the element overheats or if something burns on its surface. It might also indicate a short circuit. If you see visible damage to the element, that is a sure sign. Look for cracks, blisters, or melting on the metal rod. This damage means the element is not conducting electricity properly. It needs replacement. Catching these signs early helps you address the problem quickly. [How to clean dishwasher heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-heating-element) is sometimes a first step, as debris can cause issues, but often failure means replacement.

*   **Dishes Not Drying:** This is the most common and noticeable symptom. After the wash cycle finishes, your dishes will still be wet. You might see water droplets or feel moisture on plates and glasses. The drying cycle depends on the element heating air. If it fails, dishes stay wet.
*   **Water Not Heating:** During the wash cycle, the water should get very hot. You can sometimes hear the element working. If you feel the water through the door or carefully check during a paused cycle, it will be cold. Cold water does not clean or sanitize well. This leaves food residue.
*   **Unusual Odors:** A burning smell during or after a cycle suggests electrical problems. It might be the element overheating. It could also be plastic or food burning on its surface. This smell needs immediate attention.
*   **Error Codes:** Many modern dishwashers display specific error codes. These codes appear on the control panel. They often signal issues with the heating circuit or temperature sensor. Refer to your dishwasher's manual to understand what these codes mean.
*   **Visible Damage:** Inspect the heating element directly. You might see cracks, breaks, discoloration, or signs of melting. Any physical damage means the element is faulty. It needs replacement.

## Performing Visual Inspections for Heating Element Damage

Before you grab any tools, a visual inspection is a crucial first step. This simple check can often confirm a problem. First, always unplug the dishwasher from its power source. Safety comes first. Pull the dishwasher away from the wall or turn off the circuit breaker. This prevents electric shock. You do not want any power running to the unit.

Next, open the dishwasher door. Pull out the lower dish rack. This gives you clear access to the bottom of the tub. The heating element is the large, U-shaped or circular metal rod at the very bottom. Look closely at the entire element. You are looking for obvious signs of damage.

Check for any breaks, cracks, or bulges in the metal. Sometimes, the element might look corroded. You might see areas that appear melted or severely discolored. This discoloration can range from dark brown to black spots. These spots indicate extreme heat or electrical shorting. Look for any exposed wires or burned areas around the element's terminals. A healthy heating element should look uniformly metallic and smooth. If you spot any of these issues, the element is likely bad. It requires replacement. This visual check can save you time from further testing. It provides a quick and clear answer. You can often see damage without removing the element. [Can you test a dishwasher heating element without removing?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-test-a-dishwasher-heating-element-without-removing) Yes, a visual check is the first step, and a continuity test can often be done with the element still installed.

## Electrical Testing Your Dishwasher Heating Element with a Multimeter

If the visual inspection does not show clear damage, an electrical test is next. You need a multimeter for this step. A multimeter measures electrical properties like voltage, current, and resistance. For a heating element, you will test its continuity and resistance. This tells you if electricity can flow through it. It also measures the element's health.

First, ensure the dishwasher is unplugged from the power outlet. This is non-negotiable for your safety. Pull the dishwasher away from the wall to access the back or disconnect the power at the breaker. Locate the heating element's terminals. These are usually two metal posts where wires connect. They are at the front of the heating element, underneath the dishwasher tub. You might need to remove a kick panel or access panel to reach them.

Set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting, which measures resistance. If your multimeter has an auto-ranging feature, it will select the right range. If not, choose a low resistance range, like 200 ohms. Touch one probe of the multimeter to each heating element terminal. A good heating element will show a resistance reading between 10 and 30 ohms. This exact number varies by model. Check your dishwasher's service manual for the precise specification. If the multimeter reads "OL" (Open Line) or "infinite," it means there is no continuity. The circuit is broken. This indicates a bad heating element. If it reads 0 ohms, it means a short circuit, also indicating a bad element. This test provides a definitive answer about the element's electrical integrity. [How to test KitchenAid dishwasher heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-kitchenaid-dishwasher-heating-element) procedures are generally the same for most brands. The resistance values might vary slightly.

### Step-by-Step Multimeter Testing:

1.  **Safety First:** Disconnect all power to the dishwasher. Unplug it or turn off the circuit breaker. This prevents electrical shock during testing.
2.  **Access the Element:** Open the dishwasher door and remove the lower rack. You will see the element at the bottom of the tub. For better access to terminals, you might need to tilt the dishwasher or access from the front kick panel.
3.  **Locate Terminals:** Identify the two metal terminals where wires connect to the heating element. These are usually visible underneath the dishwasher, near the front.
4.  **Set Multimeter:** Turn your multimeter dial to the ohms (Ω) setting. Choose a low range, such as 200 ohms, if your meter is not auto-ranging.
5.  **Test Continuity:** Place one probe of the multimeter on each terminal of the heating element. It does not matter which probe goes on which terminal.
6.  **Read Results:**
    *   **Good Element:** You should get a reading between 10 and 30 ohms. The specific value varies by model, so check your manual if possible.
    *   **Bad Element (Open Circuit):** The multimeter displays "OL," "1," or "infinite." This means the electrical path is broken. The element is burned out.
    *   **Bad Element (Short Circuit):** The multimeter displays 0 ohms. This means there is a direct short. The element is also bad.

This multimeter test provides a clear, objective measurement. It helps confirm if the heating element is the cause of your dishwasher problems. If the test shows "OL" or "0," then the element is definitely faulty.

## Checking the Thermostat and Other Related Components

A bad heating element is a common problem. However, other parts can cause similar symptoms. It is wise to check these related components before replacing the heating element. The thermostat, or thermistor, is one such part. It monitors the water temperature inside the dishwasher. It tells the heating element when to turn on and off. If the thermostat fails, it might not signal the element to heat the water. This leads to cold water and wet dishes.

You can test the thermostat with your multimeter. Set it to the continuity setting. Disconnect the thermostat's wires. Touch the probes to the thermostat's terminals. A good thermostat will show continuity when at room temperature. Its resistance will change as temperature changes. If it shows "OL" all the time, it is likely bad.

Another component to check is the thermal fuse. This fuse protects the dishwasher from overheating. If it blows, it breaks the circuit to the heating element. This prevents the element from getting power. Test the thermal fuse for continuity with your multimeter. An "OL" reading means the fuse is blown. It needs replacement.

Finally, consider the control board. This is the brain of your dishwasher. It sends power to the heating element. If the control board is faulty, it might not send the correct signals. This prevents the element from working. Diagnosing a bad control board is more complex. You might need a professional for this. However, knowing these components can also fail helps in a full diagnosis. Sometimes, what seems like a heating element issue is a problem elsewhere. For example, [how to tell if GE dishwasher control board is bad](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-if-ge-dishwasher-control-board-is-bad) involves looking at various functions, not just heating.
