## Key Considerations When Buying a Dishwasher

Finding where to buy your dishwasher is only one part of the process. You also need to choose the right dishwasher for your home. Several factors influence this decision. Think about your kitchen space. Measure the opening where the dishwasher will go. This ensures a proper fit. Standard sizes are common, but always double-check.

Consider the capacity you need. A small household might be fine with a compact model. A large family needs more rack space. Think about how often you run the dishwasher. Also, look at the features. Do you need a third rack for utensils? What about adjustable tines? Some models offer special cycles for sanitization or delicate items.

Energy efficiency is another big factor. Look for the ENERGY STAR label. These models use less water and electricity. This saves you money on utility bills over time. Noise level is also important, especially in open-concept homes. Look for models with lower decibel (dB) ratings. Quieter dishwashers make your home more peaceful.

### Important Factors for Your Dishwasher Purchase

*   **Size and Fit:** Measure your cabinet opening carefully. Standard dishwashers are 24 inches wide. Compact or [countertop models](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-buy-countertop-dishwasher) exist for smaller spaces.
*   **Capacity:** Decide based on your household size. Look at place setting capacity and rack flexibility. Some models have adjustable racks for larger items.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Wash Cycles:** Heavy duty, light, quick wash, sanitize.
    *   **Drying Options:** Heated dry, air dry, condensation drying. For example, do you prefer a [Bosch dishwasher with heated drying](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-any-bosch-dishwashers-have-heated-drying)?
    *   **Noise Level:** Measured in decibels (dB). Lower numbers mean quieter operation. Aim for 45 dB or less for quiet performance.
    *   **Controls:** Top-mounted for a sleek look, or front-mounted for easy access.
    *   **Smart Features:** Wi-Fi connectivity, app control, remote start.
*   **Energy Efficiency:** Look for ENERGY STAR certified models. They save water and electricity. This lowers your utility bills.
*   **Material:**
    *   **Stainless Steel Tub:** Durable, resists stains, better drying.
    *   **Plastic Tub:** More affordable, but may retain odors over time. Understand if [plastic tub dishwashers are bad](https://homeessentialsguide.com/are-plastic-tub-dishwashers-bad) for your specific needs.
*   **Reliability and Brand Reputation:** Research brands known for durability and good customer service. Read reviews about specific models. Some [Bosch dishwashers have been recalled](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-bosch-dishwashers-are-being-recalled) in the past, so staying informed about product safety is wise.

Deciding on these factors before you shop helps narrow your choices. It makes the buying process smoother. You can focus on finding a dishwasher that truly meets your needs.

## Tips for Finding Deals and Discounts

Everyone loves a good deal. Dishwashers are a big purchase. Saving money is always a good idea. Timing your purchase can lead to significant savings. New models usually come out in the fall. This means older models often go on sale in late summer or early fall. Major holiday weekends are also prime times for sales. Look for promotions around Black Friday, Memorial Day, and Labor Day.

Comparing prices across different retailers is crucial. Do not just buy the first one you see. Use online price comparison tools. Check both brick-and-mortar stores and online shops. Some retailers offer price matching. If you find a lower price elsewhere, ask if they will match it. This can save you a trip or help you buy from your preferred store.

Look for floor models or open-box items. These are often discounted. They might have minor cosmetic flaws. Always inspect them carefully before buying. Ask about the warranty on these items. Sometimes, they come with a full warranty. Other times, it might be limited.

Many major retailers and home improvement stores offer professional installation. This is a huge convenience. They handle the heavy lifting.

If you buy online, confirm if installation is available through third-party services. Some online retailers partner with local contractors. Others will deliver the unit to your curb. You would then need to arrange installation separately. This can add to the overall cost and effort.
