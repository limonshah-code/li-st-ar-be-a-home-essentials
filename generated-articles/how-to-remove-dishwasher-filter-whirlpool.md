### How To Remove Dishwasher Filter Whirlpool: A Quick Answer

To remove your Whirlpool dishwasher filter, first turn off the power. Then, pull out the lower dish rack. Locate the cylindrical filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. Twist the outer filter component counter-clockwise to unlock it, then lift it and the inner mesh filter straight out.

## Why Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter Needs Attention

My dishes sometimes come out with food bits stuck to them. This is often the first sign something is wrong. A dirty or clogged Whirlpool dishwasher filter is usually the culprit. The filter plays a crucial role in trapping food particles and preventing them from recirculating during the wash cycle.

When the filter gets too full of debris, water cannot flow through it properly. This means the dirty water continues to wash your dishes. You might also notice unpleasant odors coming from your dishwasher. These smells result from food particles decaying inside the filter or the filter housing. Ignoring these signs leads to bigger problems over time. Your dishwasher might work harder, leading to decreased efficiency or even damage to its components. Regular cleaning prevents these issues, keeping your appliance running smoothly. You ensure your dishes emerge sparkling clean every time. [Is there a filter in my Whirlpool dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-there-a-filter-in-my-whirlpool-dishwasher) is a common question, and yes, most models have one that needs regular care.

Many homeowners do not realize their dishwasher has a filter. Modern Whirlpool models typically feature a removable filter system. Older models might have a self-cleaning filter that grinds up food. Knowing your model helps with maintenance. A clean filter improves water circulation, enhances cleaning performance, and extends the life of your appliance. It also helps avoid costly repairs down the line. I always feel better after giving my dishwasher this simple care.

## Essential Preparations Before Filter Removal

Before you even touch the filter, some important steps keep you safe and make the job easier. Safety is my top concern. Always start by disconnecting the power to your Whirlpool dishwasher. You can do this by unplugging the appliance from the wall outlet. If it is hardwired, flip the circuit breaker switch for the dishwasher in your home's electrical panel.

Next, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dish rack. This gives you clear access to the bottom of the tub. You need space to maneuver and remove the filter without obstruction. You might find a small amount of standing water at the bottom of the tub. This is normal. You can use a towel or sponge to soak up any excess water. This prevents spills when you remove the filter.

Gather a few simple tools. I usually keep a pair of rubber gloves nearby. These protect my hands from any grime. A few paper towels or a rag are useful for wiping up debris. You might also want a soft brush for cleaning the filter later. Understanding your filter type helps. Most modern Whirlpool dishwashers have a two-part removable filter system. It usually consists of a large, cylindrical outer filter and a fine mesh inner filter. Recognizing these parts will make removal simpler. Knowing these details helps you [remove your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-your-dishwasher-filter) effectively. This preparation ensures a smooth and safe filter removal process.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Remove the Outer Filter

Locating the filter is your first practical step inside the dishwasher. Open the door completely. Look at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. You will see a cylindrical component, often in the center or slightly to one side. This is your filter assembly. It usually stands out from the rest of the tub floor.

My Whirlpool model has a dark gray filter. Yours might look similar. The outer filter is the larger, main body of this cylinder. It typically has small openings or mesh to allow water through. You need to grasp this outer filter firmly. It usually has small tabs or an arrow indicating the direction to turn.

To unlock the outer filter, twist it counter-clockwise. You might need to apply a firm but gentle force. It should turn about a quarter of a turn. You will hear a click or feel it release from its locked position. Once it unlocks, the filter is ready to be lifted out. Carefully lift the entire filter assembly straight up. It should come out easily once unlocked. If it feels stuck, do not force it. Double-check that you have twisted it enough. Often, the inner mesh filter is still attached to the outer filter when you lift it. You will handle that next. This process makes it easy to [remove the filter in your Whirlpool dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-filter-in-whirlpool-dishwasher) without damaging any parts.

*   **Locate the Filter:** The filter assembly sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.
*   **Identify the Outer Filter:** This is the larger, cylindrical component.
*   **Grasp and Twist:** Hold the outer filter and turn it counter-clockwise.
*   **Listen for the Click:** A click sound or a clear release indicates it is unlocked.
*   **Lift Out:** Carefully lift the entire assembly straight up from the tub.

## Removing the Inner Mesh Filter Component

Once you have lifted the outer filter assembly from the dishwasher tub, you will usually find another component inside it. This is the inner mesh filter. It is a finer screen designed to catch smaller food particles. These smaller bits often slip through the outer filter's coarser openings. For a truly clean filter, you must separate and clean both parts.

My Whirlpool filter always comes out as a single unit first. I then separate the two parts. Look closely at the outer filter. The inner mesh filter typically sits inside it. It might be held in place by small clips or simply seated snugly. You usually just need to pull it gently. Some models might require a slight twist to release the inner filter. It detaches from the outer filter fairly easily once you get the hang of it. This separation is important. It allows you to clean both surfaces thoroughly. Food debris can build up between the two layers. This area is often overlooked.

Take a moment to inspect both components after separation. You will likely see a collection of food scraps, grease, and other debris. This buildup affects your dishwasher's performance. Removing this inner mesh filter ensures you address all areas of potential clogging. It helps improve water flow and sanitation. This dual-filter system design is common in Whirlpool models. It provides superior filtration compared to single-layer filters. Understanding this system is key to knowing [how to remove your Whirlpool dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-whirlpool-dishwasher-filter) completely for effective cleaning.

## Thorough Cleaning of Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter

Now that you have successfully removed both the outer and inner filter components, it's time for the actual cleaning. This step is crucial for restoring your dishwasher's performance. I always take my filter components to the sink. Start by rinsing both parts under warm, running water. This helps dislodge any loose food particles. You will be surprised how much food debris collects here.

For more stubborn grime, use a soft brush. An old toothbrush works perfectly for this task. Gently scrub the mesh and plastic surfaces of both filters. Pay special attention to any crevices where food can hide. I also use a mild dish soap. Apply a small amount to your brush and scrub away any greasy buildup. Soap helps cut through fats and oils. Make sure to rinse thoroughly after scrubbing to remove all soap residue. Any soap left behind can cause sudsing issues in your dishwasher later. This thorough approach is part of [how to remove and clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-and-clean-whirlpool-dishwasher-filter) effectively.

Don't forget the filter housing area inside your dishwasher tub. After removing the filter, you might see some debris in the opening. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe this area clean. Ensure no food particles remain before reinstallation. Inspect both filter parts for any signs of damage, such as cracks or tears in the mesh. A damaged filter won't perform as well. If you find damage, consider replacing the filter. I recommend cleaning your Whirlpool dishwasher filter once a month, or more often if you frequently wash heavily soiled dishes. Regular cleaning prevents major blockages and keeps your dishwasher smelling fresh.

*   **Rinse with Warm Water:** Flush away loose food particles from both filter components.
*   **Scrub with a Brush and Soap:** Use a soft brush (like an old toothbrush) and mild dish soap to remove stubborn grime and grease.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Ensure no soap residue remains on the filter parts.
*   **Clean the Housing:** Wipe the filter housing area inside the dishwasher tub with a damp cloth.
*   **Inspect for Damage:** Check both filters for cracks or tears and replace if needed.
*   **Frequency:** Clean the filter monthly or as needed to prevent buildup.

## Reinstalling Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter Correctly

After you have cleaned your Whirlpool dishwasher filter, putting it back correctly is important. This step prevents leaks and ensures the filter works properly. First, make sure both the inner mesh filter and the outer filter are completely dry. Then, reassemble the two parts. The inner mesh filter usually fits snugly inside the outer cylindrical filter. Ensure it is seated correctly and securely.

Next, place the assembled filter back into the filter housing at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. You will notice grooves or alignment points in the tub. Line up the tabs on the outer filter with these points. This helps the filter sit flush. It should slide down easily into its designated spot. Do not force it. If it does not go in smoothly, re-check your alignment. My filter often requires a gentle wiggle to find its home. This attention to detail ensures you can [put your Whirlpool dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-whirlpool-dishwasher-filter-back-in) without problems.

Once the filter is seated, twist the outer filter clockwise. You should feel it lock into place. Listen for a click or feel it become firm. This secures the filter during wash cycles. If the filter is not locked, it could come loose, allowing debris to enter the pump. This causes clogs and poor cleaning. Give it a gentle tug to confirm it's secure. Replace the lower dish rack. Finally, restore power to your dishwasher. You are now ready to enjoy cleaner dishes and a more efficient appliance. A correctly reinstalled filter is just as vital as a clean one.

## Troubleshooting Common Whirlpool Dishwasher Filter Issues

Sometimes, even after following the steps, you might encounter issues with your Whirlpool dishwasher filter. One common problem is a filter that feels stuck or is hard to turn during removal. This often happens due to excessive buildup of hardened food debris and mineral deposits. If this occurs, try soaking the area around the filter with warm, soapy water for about 15-20 minutes. This can help loosen the grime. You can also try gently rocking the filter back and forth while twisting to break up any blockages. Avoid using excessive force, as this can damage the filter or the housing.

Another frequent complaint is that dishes are still not clean after cleaning the filter. If your dishes still have food particles or a cloudy film, the issue might lie elsewhere. While a clean filter is essential, other components also affect cleaning performance. Check your dishwasher's spray arms. Ensure the holes on the spray arms are not clogged with debris. You can often clean these by poking the holes with a toothpick. Also, verify that you are using the correct amount and type of detergent. Hard water can also affect cleaning; a rinse aid can help with this. If you are regularly looking at [how to clean your Whirlpool dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-Whirlpool-dishwasher-filter) and still facing problems, it might be time to look at other parts.

Persistent odors after filter cleaning can be frustrating. This might indicate mildew or bacteria growth in other areas of the dishwasher. Inspect the door gasket for any mold. Run a dishwasher cleaning cycle using a specialized cleaner or a cup of white vinegar. Place the vinegar in an upright cup on the top rack and run a hot water cycle. In some rare cases, the filter itself might be damaged, allowing debris to pass through. If you notice cracks or tears, you may need to replace the entire filter assembly. These troubleshooting tips help you get your dishwasher back to peak performance.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: How often should I clean my Whirlpool dishwasher filter?

Regular cleaning prevents food buildup and maintains optimal cleaning performance. This simple routine avoids issues like odors and dirty dishes.

Most modern Whirlpool dishwashers have a removable filter at the bottom of the tub. Older models might feature a self-cleaning filter system that grinds food during the wash cycle. If you do not see a visible, removable filter, consult your owner's manual. It will specify your dishwasher's filter type and maintenance needs.

### Q3: Can I run my Whirlpool dishwasher without the filter?
No, you should never run your Whirlpool dishwasher without the filter in place. The filter protects the pump and drain from large food particles and debris.

### Q5: My dishes are still dirty after cleaning the filter. What is wrong?
If dishes remain dirty after cleaning the filter, other issues might be present. Check your spray arms for clogged nozzles. Ensure you use enough detergent and that it is fresh.
