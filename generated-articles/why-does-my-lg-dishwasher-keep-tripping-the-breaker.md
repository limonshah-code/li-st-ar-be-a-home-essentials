### Why does my LG dishwasher keep tripping the breaker?

Your LG dishwasher keeps tripping the breaker because of an electrical fault or an overloaded circuit. Common culprits include a defective heating element, a failing wash motor or drain pump, or a short circuit in the wiring. Water leaks causing a ground fault can also trip the breaker for safety.

## Understanding Circuit Breakers and Their Role

Circuit breakers are vital safety devices in your home. They protect electrical circuits from damage caused by overcurrent or short circuits. Think of them as the gatekeepers of your home's electrical flow. When an LG dishwasher demands too much power or has a fault, the breaker trips. This action stops the power. It prevents wires from overheating. It also protects your appliance from further damage.

Understanding how a breaker works helps you find the problem. Each breaker controls a specific circuit. Many homes have dedicated circuits for large appliances like dishwashers. This means only the dishwasher should draw power from that circuit. If other devices share the circuit, it can lead to an overload. An overload makes the breaker trip as a safety measure. It simply means the circuit is handling more current than it can safely manage. Recognizing this is the first step in solving why your LG dishwasher might be tripping the breaker.

## Common LG Dishwasher Components That Trip Breakers

Several internal components in your LG dishwasher can cause a breaker to trip. These parts draw a lot of power or can develop electrical faults. Knowing these common culprits helps narrow down your search for the problem. Let's look at the main ones.

### The Heating Element

The heating element is a top reason for breaker trips. Your dishwasher uses it to heat water during wash cycles. It also helps dry dishes with heat. This element draws a significant amount of electricity. Over time, it can wear out or suffer damage. Damage might cause it to short circuit. A short circuit means electricity takes an unintended path. This sudden surge in current immediately trips the breaker. If your breaker trips during the heating or drying phase, the heating element is a strong suspect.

### The Wash Motor and Drain Pump

The wash motor powers the spray arms, circulating water inside the dishwasher. The drain pump removes dirty water. Both components contain internal windings and electrical connections. If the motor or pump becomes old, worn, or damaged, it can draw too much current. It might also develop an internal short. For example, if the motor bearings fail, it works harder. This extra effort can draw excessive current. If your breaker trips during the wash or drain cycle, consider these parts. A faulty drain pump can also lead to water accumulation, which may further contribute to electrical issues.

### The Door Latch and Control Board

Less common but still possible, the door latch assembly can cause issues. It contains a switch that ensures the dishwasher only runs when the door is closed. If this switch malfunctions or has a short, it can trip the breaker. The main control board manages all dishwasher functions. While rare, a faulty control board can send incorrect signals or develop internal shorts. This can lead to power surges or consistent breaker trips. If you have ruled out other components, these parts are worth considering.

## Electrical Wiring Issues and Water Leaks

Electrical problems are often the cause when an appliance trips a breaker. This holds true for your LG dishwasher. Wiring issues can create serious safety hazards. Water leaks, even small ones, can interact with electricity in dangerous ways. Understanding these risks is crucial for troubleshooting.

### Damaged Internal Wiring

Inside your LG dishwasher, many wires connect components. These wires carry electrical current. Over time, wires can become frayed, pinched, or cut. This damage can happen from vibration or wear. A damaged wire might touch the dishwasher's metal frame. This creates a short circuit. A short circuit allows electricity to bypass its normal path. This sudden surge in current immediately trips the breaker. It is the breaker's job to protect against such dangerous events. Inspecting the wiring for visible damage is an important step.

### Power Cord Damage

The power cord is the lifeline connecting your dishwasher to the electrical outlet. Like any cord, it can suffer wear and tear. Bending, crimping, or accidental cuts can expose the internal wires. If these exposed wires touch, they create a short. If they touch a grounded surface, they can cause a ground fault. Both scenarios will trip the breaker. Always check the power cord first. Ensure it is not pinched behind the dishwasher. Look for any visible signs of damage.

### Water Leaks Causing Ground Faults

Water and electricity are a dangerous mix. Your LG dishwasher uses a lot of water. If a leak occurs, water can drip onto electrical components or wiring. Even a small amount of water can create a ground fault. A ground fault means electricity is flowing to the ground through an unintended path. This path might be the water itself. Modern breakers, especially Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs), detect these faults very quickly. They trip the circuit to prevent electric shock. Common leak sources include:

*   **Hoses:** Inlet or drain hoses can crack or loosen.
*   **Pump Seals:** Seals around the wash or drain pump can fail.
*   **Tub Leaks:** Cracks in the dishwasher tub are rare but possible.

If you notice water under or near your dishwasher, address it immediately.

Water leaks are a significant concern when a breaker trips.

## Overloaded Circuits and Dedicated Circuits

Sometimes, the problem is not with your LG dishwasher itself. Instead, it might be with your home's electrical system. An overloaded circuit is a common issue. It happens when too many appliances draw power from one circuit. Your circuit breaker is designed to handle only a certain amount of current. When that limit is exceeded, the breaker trips. This is a safety feature to prevent overheating wires and potential fires.

### Understanding Circuit Capacity

Every circuit in your home has a specific amperage rating. This rating tells you how much electrical current the circuit can safely carry. For example, a 15-amp circuit can handle 15 amps of current. A 20-amp circuit can handle 20 amps. Large appliances like dishwashers, washing machines, and air conditioners draw a lot of power. They can quickly push a circuit past its limit. If your LG dishwasher is on a shared circuit with other high-power devices, an overload is likely. This is a common reason for a tripped breaker. Similar issues can occur with other appliances, like [why your Bosch dishwasher keeps tripping the electric](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-bosch-dishwasher-keep-tripping-the-electric).

### The Importance of Dedicated Circuits

Most building codes require large appliances to have a dedicated circuit. A dedicated circuit means only one appliance connects to it. Your LG dishwasher should be on its own circuit. This prevents overloads. It ensures the dishwasher receives a stable power supply. If your dishwasher shares a circuit, especially with a microwave or refrigerator, investigate this. Turn off other appliances on that circuit. Then, try running the dishwasher alone. If it no longer trips the breaker, you have found your problem. You might need an electrician to install a dedicated circuit. This is a safer and more reliable solution.

### Identifying Other Appliances on the Circuit

To check for an overloaded circuit, you need to find out which outlets and lights are on the same circuit as your dishwasher. Go to your electrical panel. Flip the breaker for the dishwasher to the "off" position. Then, check which lights or outlets in your kitchen or nearby rooms no longer work. This will show you what shares the circuit. If many other devices are on that circuit, especially heavy-duty ones, it is a strong sign of an overload. Understanding circuit loads helps prevent trips and keep your home safe.

First, try a simple reset. Locate your electrical panel. Find the breaker that controls your dishwasher. It might be labeled. Flip the breaker completely to the "off" position, then firmly to the "on" position. Sometimes, a momentary power surge causes a trip. A simple reset can fix it. If the breaker immediately trips again, a deeper electrical problem exists. Also, check your dishwasher's control panel. Some LG models have a reset function. You can try unplugging the dishwasher for a few minutes. Then, plug it back in. This can clear minor electronic glitches.

### Inspecting the Power Cord and Outlet

Visually inspect the power cord. Look for any cuts, frays, or melted spots. Make sure the cord is not pinched behind the dishwasher. Next, check the electrical outlet. Ensure the plug fits snugly. Test the outlet with another small appliance, like a phone charger or a lamp. If another appliance works fine, the outlet itself is likely okay. If the outlet does not work, the problem might be with the outlet or the wiring to it. Never use a damaged power cord. It is a fire hazard.

### Checking for Visible Water Leaks

Look for any signs of water under or around the dishwasher. Use a flashlight to check behind and beneath the unit. Even small puddles can indicate a leak. If you find water, try to locate its source. Common leak points include the water inlet hose, drain hose connections, or the pump seal. A leaky part can cause water to drip onto electrical components. This creates a ground fault, which trips the breaker. If you find a leak, address it before doing anything else.

You can find these hoses behind the dishwasher. Always turn off the water supply before checking connections.

### Avoid Overloading the Dishwasher

Overloading your dishwasher makes it work harder. This can strain the wash motor and drain pump. It can also prevent proper water circulation. Over time, this extra strain can cause components to fail. These failures can lead to breaker trips. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for loading dishes. Do not block the spray arms. Ensure dishes are spaced to allow water to flow freely. Proper loading uses less energy and reduces stress on the motor.

### Check for Proper Loading Techniques

While related to overloading, specific loading techniques also matter. Do not place large items in front of the detergent dispenser. This prevents soap from dissolving properly. Do not nest dishes, as this blocks water spray. Incorrect loading can make the dishwasher run longer. This increases the load on electrical components. Ensuring good water flow helps the wash motor and pump work efficiently. This reduces the chance of an electrical overload.

### Professional Check-ups

Consider a professional appliance check-up every few years. A technician can inspect internal components. They can check wiring for wear.
