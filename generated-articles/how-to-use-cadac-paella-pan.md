To use a Cadac paella pan, first, season it with oil and heat. Place the pan on your Cadac gas braai. Adjust the flame for even heat. Cook your paella, making sure to achieve a crispy bottom. Clean the pan after use and re-oil it for storage.

## Understanding Your Cadac Paella Pan

The Cadac paella pan is a specialized cooking surface designed for large outdoor meals. This pan is more than just a large frying pan. It offers specific features perfect for cooking paella and other big dishes. You will find it excellent for feeding a crowd. Its design ensures good heat spread, which is key for cooking evenly.

Cadac paella pans are usually made from carbon steel. Carbon steel is a great material for cooking because it heats up fast and holds heat well. This means your food cooks evenly across the entire pan surface. This material also develops a natural non-stick surface over time with proper seasoning. This seasoning makes cooking and cleaning much easier. The pan's wide, shallow shape allows ingredients to spread out. This helps liquids evaporate quickly, which is important for paella. It also creates more surface area for the rice to get crispy at the bottom.

These pans come in various sizes to fit different Cadac gas braai models. They sit directly on the pot stand or over the burner. This direct contact with the flame means efficient heat transfer. You get a powerful cooking experience outdoors. Using your Cadac paella pan opens up new cooking possibilities. It is not just for paella. Think about stir-fries, breakfast skillets, or large batches of scrambled eggs. The pan's large size handles big portions with ease. Its robust build makes it durable for outdoor use. Understanding these features helps you use the pan effectively. You will appreciate its unique benefits as you cook outdoors. This pan is a valuable addition to your outdoor kitchen.

## Initial Setup and Seasoning Your Cadac Paella Pan

Setting up your new Cadac paella pan properly is an important first step. This process creates a protective layer on the pan. It also improves its non-stick properties over time. A well-seasoned pan performs better and lasts longer. Do not skip this part.

### First-Time Cleaning

When you first get your Cadac paella pan, it might have a protective coating from the factory. This coating prevents rust during shipping and storage. You need to remove it before cooking. Wash the pan thoroughly with hot, soapy water. Use a strong scrub brush or steel wool to remove all traces of the coating. Make sure to scrub every part of the pan. Rinse it very well. Dry the pan completely immediately after washing. You can place it on your Cadac unit over low heat for a few minutes to ensure it is bone dry. Any water left on the pan can cause rust. This initial clean sets the stage for seasoning.

### Seasoning Process Explained

Seasoning your Cadac paella pan builds a layer of polymerized oil on the surface. This layer acts as a natural non-stick coating and protects against rust. The process is simple but requires patience. First, make sure the pan is perfectly dry and cool. Apply a very thin layer of high smoke point oil to the entire pan, inside and out. Good oils include grapeseed oil, flaxseed oil, or vegetable oil. Use a paper towel to wipe off any excess oil. The pan should look almost dry, not greasy.

Next, place the pan on your Cadac gas braai over medium heat. Let it heat until it starts to smoke. This smoking means the oil is bonding with the metal. Once it smokes, let it cool down slightly. Repeat the oiling and heating process at least three to four times. Each layer adds to the seasoning. The pan will turn darker with each session. This dark color indicates a good seasoning layer. This repeated heating and oiling creates a durable, non-stick surface. Properly seasoned carbon steel pans are a joy to cook with. They offer natural non-stick properties without chemicals. For specific details on this process, learning [how to season paella pan carbon steel](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-season-paella-pan-carbon-steel) is very helpful. While your pan might not be a Garcima, the principles of seasoning are universal, so [how to season garcima paella pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-season-garcima-paella-pan) can also offer useful insights into the technique.

## Setting Up Your Cadac Unit for Paella Cooking

Proper setup of your Cadac unit is vital for successful paella cooking. The heat source plays a big role in how your paella turns out. Cadac gas braais offer excellent control. This control is important for achieving the perfect paella texture and the desired crispy bottom layer. Setting things up right makes cooking easier and more enjoyable.

First, choose the right Cadac gas braai for your pan size. Cadac offers various models, from portable units to larger outdoor kitchens. Make sure your paella pan fits securely on the pot stand or over the burner. The pan should sit level to ensure even cooking. If your pan wobbles, adjust the unit or the pan placement. A stable pan is a safe pan. Connect your gas cylinder following the Cadac unit instructions. Always check for gas leaks before lighting. Safety is always a priority when cooking with gas.

Once the pan is on the unit, consider heat management. Paella needs different heat levels at various stages. Start with medium to high heat to sauté ingredients. Then, reduce the heat to a steady simmer after adding the rice and broth. The Cadac gas braai lets you adjust the flame precisely. This precision helps you control the cooking pace. For the final stage, when you want the "socarrat" (the crispy rice crust), you might need a burst of higher heat. Distribute your ingredients evenly in the pan. This helps with uniform cooking. Rotate the pan occasionally if you notice hot spots. Cadac units generally provide even heat, but minor adjustments can always fine-tune the process. Proper setup ensures your pan receives consistent heat. This consistency leads to perfectly cooked paella every time.

## The Art of Cooking Paella with Your Cadac Pan

Cooking paella on your Cadac pan is a rewarding experience. It brings together fresh ingredients and outdoor cooking. The large surface area of the Cadac paella pan is perfect for this traditional Spanish dish. Success comes from good preparation and careful heat management.

### Ingredient Prep for Perfect Paella

Start by preparing all your ingredients. Paella cooking moves quickly once you begin. You need everything chopped, measured, and ready. This is called "mise en place." For a classic paella, you will need short-grain rice, like Bomba or Calasparra. Good quality broth (chicken, seafood, or vegetable) is essential. Saffron threads give paella its color and distinct flavor. Other common ingredients include olive oil, onions, garlic, peppers, tomatoes, and your choice of protein (chicken, rabbit, seafood, or vegetables). Have extra hot broth ready; you might need it. Ensuring all ingredients are at room temperature can help with even cooking.

### Step-by-Step Cooking Guide

1.  **Sauté the aromatics:** Heat olive oil in your Cadac paella pan over medium heat. Add onions and peppers, cooking until soft. Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
2.  **Add protein:** If using chicken or rabbit, add it now and brown on all sides. Push ingredients to the side of the pan.
3.  **Create the sofrito:** Add chopped tomatoes to the center and cook them down until thickened. Mix with other ingredients.
4.  **Toast the rice:** Add the paella rice to the pan. Stir it gently with the sofrito and other ingredients for a few minutes. This coats the rice grains in oil and flavor. Do not wash the rice.
5.  **Add broth and saffron:** Pour in the hot broth. Distribute the saffron threads evenly. Stir everything once to mix. Do not stir the rice again after this point. Stirring releases starch and prevents the socarrat.
6.  **Simmer and cook:** Increase heat briefly to bring the liquid to a boil. Then reduce the heat to a steady simmer. Cook uncovered until the rice absorbs almost all the liquid. This takes about 15-20 minutes.
7.  **Rest:** Once the liquid is mostly gone and rice is tender, remove the pan from heat. Cover it loosely with foil or a clean kitchen towel. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes. This helps the rice steam and finish cooking.

### Mastering the Socarrat

The "socarrat" is the crispy, caramelized crust of rice at the bottom of the paella pan. It is a prized part of authentic paella. To achieve it, after the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and looks nearly done, increase the heat to medium-high for the last few minutes. Listen for a crackling sound. You might even smell a slight toasting aroma. Do not stir. The goal is to lightly toast the bottom layer of rice without burning it. Lift a small section with a spoon to check for browning. Once you see a good crust, remove from heat. The Cadac paella pan's excellent heat distribution makes creating socarrat easier.

## Beyond Paella: Versatile Uses for Your Cadac Paella Pan

While the Cadac paella pan is famous for paella, its large size and excellent heat retention make it incredibly versatile. Do not limit your outdoor cooking to just one dish. This pan can handle a wide range of recipes, making it a true workhorse for your outdoor kitchen. You will find yourself reaching for it often.

Think about cooking breakfast outdoors. The Cadac paella pan is perfect for large batches of scrambled eggs, bacon, or sausages. You can even cook pancakes or French toast on its wide surface. Imagine a hearty breakfast ready for a camping trip or a big family gathering. The pan's size allows you to cook multiple items at once. This saves time and effort. It keeps everyone happy with a warm meal.

Stir-fries are another great option. The pan's wide and somewhat shallow shape works well for quickly cooking vegetables and meat. You get high heat from the Cadac burner, which is ideal for stir-frying. Toss ingredients frequently to ensure even cooking. The pan handles the volume needed for family-sized stir-fries. You can make a colorful and healthy meal in minutes.

Consider using it for large stews or curries. While not its primary purpose, the Cadac paella pan can simmer large volumes of liquid. You can brown meat and vegetables directly in the pan. Then add liquids and let it simmer. This saves you from using multiple pots. Its wide base allows for more evaporation, which can thicken sauces faster. You can also make chili or goulash for a crowd. The pan is also great for sautéing large amounts of vegetables. You can roast vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and onions right in the pan. Add some herbs and oil for a delicious side dish. Its robust construction means it can handle heavy ingredients. This pan is more than a single-purpose item. It enhances your outdoor cooking creativity.

## Cleaning and Maintaining Your Cadac Paella Pan

Proper cleaning and maintenance are crucial for the longevity of your Cadac paella pan. A well-cared-for pan will last for many years. It will also perform better with each use. Carbon steel pans need a different approach than non-stick pans. Understanding this difference is key to keeping your pan in top condition.

### Immediate Cleaning Tips

Clean your Cadac paella pan immediately after cooking while it is still warm. This makes cleaning much easier. Do not use soap, especially if your pan is well-seasoned. Soap can strip away the hard-earned seasoning layer. Instead, use hot water and a stiff brush or a non-abrasive scrubber. Scrape away any food residue. If food is stuck, you can add some water to the pan and bring it to a simmer on the Cadac unit. This will loosen stuck-on bits. Use a plastic scraper or wooden spatula to remove stubborn food. Rinse the pan thoroughly with hot water.

After cleaning, it is vital to dry the pan completely. Water is the enemy of carbon steel, causing rust. You can place the pan back on the Cadac unit over low heat for a few minutes. This ensures all moisture evaporates. Once dry, apply a very thin layer of cooking oil to the entire surface, inside and out. Use a paper towel to spread the oil evenly. This light oil coat protects the seasoning and prevents rust during storage. Your pan is then ready for its next use. Following these steps helps maintain the pan's natural non-stick surface.

### Long-Term Care for Longevity

For long-term care, store your Cadac paella pan in a dry place. Avoid humid environments where rust can easily form. If you stack other pans on top, place a paper towel or cloth between them. This prevents scratches and absorbs any residual moisture. Re-season your pan periodically, especially if food starts to stick or you notice any rust spots. A quick re-seasoning session, like the initial seasoning process, can refresh the surface. Regularly inspect your pan for any signs of wear. Address issues like rust quickly to prevent them from spreading. With consistent care, your Cadac paella pan will remain a reliable cooking tool for many years. Learning [how to take care of paella pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-take-care-of-paella-pan) provides further guidance on its overall upkeep, and specific tips from [how to stop paella pan rusting](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-stop-paella-pan-rusting) are invaluable for its preservation.

## Troubleshooting Common Cadac Paella Pan Issues

Even with proper care, you might encounter some common issues when using your Cadac paella pan. Knowing how to fix these problems helps you keep cooking with confidence. Most issues relate to seasoning or heat control. Do not worry; solutions are often simple.

### Food Sticking

If food sticks to your Cadac paella pan, it often means the seasoning layer is not strong enough. This can happen if the pan was not seasoned well initially. It can also happen if the seasoning has worn off. You might have used too much soap or cooked very acidic foods. To fix sticking, first clean the pan thoroughly. Make sure to remove any sticky residue. Then, re-season the pan. Apply a thin layer of oil and heat it until it smokes. Repeat this process several times. Each new layer of seasoning will improve the non-stick quality. Over time, and with regular use, your pan will build a robust non-stick surface. Patience is key. Sometimes, using too little oil when cooking also causes sticking. Add a bit more oil to the pan before adding ingredients. For specific solutions if your pan feels sticky, refer to [why is my paella pan sticky](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-paella-pan-sticky).

### Uneven Cooking

Uneven cooking can occur if your Cadac unit's burner is not distributing heat evenly. It can also happen if the pan is not level. First, check that your Cadac paella pan sits flat and stable on the gas braai. If it wobbles, adjust its position. Next, observe the flame distribution. Most Cadac units offer good heat spread. However, some areas might be hotter than others. You can rotate the pan every few minutes during cooking. This helps ensure all parts of the dish cook at the same rate. Also, make sure your ingredients are spread evenly in the pan. Overcrowding can lead to uneven cooking. Give food enough space to cook properly. Adjusting the heat slowly and observing the cooking process helps you learn your pan's hot spots.

### Rust Development

Rust is a common issue for carbon steel pans, especially if left wet. If you see rust spots on your Cadac paella pan, act quickly. First, remove the rust. Use steel wool or a rough scrub pad with a little hot water. Scrub the rusty areas until the metal is clean and shiny again. Rinse the pan thoroughly. Immediately dry the pan completely. You can put it on the Cadac burner for a few minutes to ensure it is bone dry. After drying, apply a fresh, thin layer of cooking oil to the entire pan. Then, re-season the pan by heating it until it smokes. Repeat this seasoning process multiple times. This protects the newly cleaned metal.

For practical steps to fix rust, look at [how to get rust off paella pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-rust-off-paella-pan). Proper drying and re-oiling after every use are the best ways to prevent rust from forming.

## FAQ Section

### Can I use my Cadac paella pan indoors?
Cadac paella pans are designed primarily for outdoor use with Cadac gas braais. Their large size makes them less practical for most indoor stovetops. Some induction or electric stoves might not provide even heat across such a large pan. Using them outdoors with their intended Cadac unit offers the best performance and safety.

### What size paella pan should I get for my Cadac?
The best size depends on your Cadac gas braai model and how many people you plan to feed. Cadac offers various pan sizes. Check your Cadac unit's manual or product description for compatible pan sizes. Measure your unit's pot stand or cooking area. Choose a pan that fits securely and allows for even heat distribution.

### How do I store my Cadac paella pan?
Store your Cadac paella pan in a dry place to prevent rust. After cleaning and drying completely, apply a thin layer of cooking oil to the entire pan surface. This protects the seasoning.

### Can I use metal utensils on my Cadac paella pan?
Yes, you can use metal utensils on your Cadac paella pan. Unlike non-stick pans with chemical coatings, carbon steel pans are durable. Metal utensils will not damage the seasoned surface. In fact, using metal can sometimes help scrape up bits of the "socarrat" crust. This is a benefit for paella cooking.

### What's the best way to get the socarrat on a Cadac?
To get the "socarrat," increase the heat to medium-high for the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. Do not stir the rice. Listen for a distinct crackling sound. You might smell a toasted aroma. Lift a small part of the rice with a spoon to check for a golden-brown crust. Remove from heat immediately once achieved.

### How often should I re-season my Cadac paella pan?
The frequency of re-seasoning depends on how often you use your pan and how you clean it. If food starts to stick, or you see rust, it is time to re-season. Generally, a full re-seasoning might be needed every few months with regular use. A quick wipe down with oil after each clean helps maintain the seasoning.
