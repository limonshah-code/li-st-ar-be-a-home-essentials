3.  **Work Alcohol Around the Button Edges:** Press the sticky button down. Then, using the alcohol-dampened cotton swab, carefully work the swab around all edges of the depressed button. The alcohol needs to get into the tiny gap to dissolve the sticky substance.
4.  **Press and Release Repeatedly:** While working the alcohol, repeatedly press and release the sticky button. This helps the alcohol penetrate deeper and break down the residue. Continue this process, using fresh swabs if needed, until the button moves freely.
5.  **Clean Excess Residue:** Once the button moves smoothly, wipe away any excess alcohol or dissolved residue from the remote's surface with a clean, dry microfiber cloth.

This method typically resolves most sticky button issues without needing to open the remote.

### Cleaning Button Crevices

Even if buttons aren't sticky, the tiny spaces around and between them can accumulate a surprising amount of dirt, dust, and lint. This grime can make the remote look dirty and affect tactile feedback.

1.  **Use a Toothpick or Non-Metallic Tool:** For hardened dirt or compacted lint in the crevices, use a wooden toothpick or a non-metallic spudger. Gently scrape or pick the debris out of the gaps. Be very careful not to press too hard or slip, which could damage the remote's surface or buttons.
2.  **Follow with an Alcohol-Dampened Cotton Swab:** After dislodging the larger pieces of grime, use a cotton swab lightly dampened with isopropyl alcohol to clean the now-exposed surfaces within the crevices. The alcohol will remove remaining film and sanitize the area.
3.  **Wipe Down with a Dry Cloth:** Finish by wiping the cleaned areas with a dry microfiber cloth to remove any moisture. Ensure all alcohol has evaporated before using the remote.

For stubborn stains on the remote's plastic casing, you can often address them using the principles from [how to clean stains on plastic](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-on-plastic).
