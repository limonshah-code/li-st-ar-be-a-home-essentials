### How do you unlock a Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665?

To unlock a Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665, first check for and disable the child lock feature, usually by pressing and holding specific buttons like "Heated Dry" or "Control Lock" for three seconds. If that fails, perform a power cycle by unplugging the unit or flipping its circuit breaker off for 5 minutes.

### Understanding the Control Lock Feature on Kenmore Elite Model 665

Many modern dishwashers include a control lock. This feature is important for safety. It prevents unauthorized use of the appliance. Parents often use it to keep children safe. The control lock disables the buttons on the control panel. This means you cannot start a cycle or change settings. Your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665 has this feature.

The control lock makes your dishwasher appear frozen. You might press buttons and nothing happens. The display might show a specific indicator. This indicator tells you the lock is active. It is important to know how to identify and deactivate this feature. Doing so can quickly solve your "locked" dishwasher problem. This is usually the first thing to check.

#### Identifying the Control Lock Indicator

Your Kenmore Elite Model 665 dishwasher has a display panel. This panel shows different lights or symbols. When the control lock is active, you will see an indicator. This might be a lock symbol. It could also be "LOC" or "CL" on the digital display. Some models use a specific light next to a "Control Lock" or "Child Lock" button.

Look closely at your dishwasher's control panel. The indicator tells you the dishwasher is not broken. It simply means the lock function is on. Identifying this indicator is your first step. It confirms the control lock is active. This saves you time on other troubleshooting steps.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Deactivating Child Lock

Disabling the child lock is a simple process. It requires a specific button press sequence. Most Kenmore Elite Model 665 dishwashers use a press-and-hold method. This prevents accidental deactivation. You must hold the button for a few seconds. The exact button varies slightly by model year.

First, locate the "Control Lock" button. Sometimes it is labeled "Child Lock." Other times, it shares a button with another function. For example, it might be the "Heated Dry" button. Once found, press and hold this button. Keep holding it for about three to five seconds. You should hear a beep or see the indicator light turn off. This means the lock is now inactive. Your dishwasher should respond to other button presses.

#### Common Button Combinations for Model 665

The specific buttons for unlocking a Kenmore Elite Model 665 can vary. Most models follow a similar pattern. Often, you will look for a button labeled "Control Lock" or "Child Lock." This is the most straightforward option. If you do not see such a label, check other buttons.

Many Kenmore models use the "Heated Dry" button. You might also find it combined with "Start" or "Cancel." To unlock, press and hold this button for 3-5 seconds. The lock indicator on the display should disappear. If this does not work, try a combination. Sometimes, you need to press two buttons at once. Your owner's manual has the exact combination for your specific model. Refer to it for precise instructions.

### The Power Cycle Reset: A Universal Troubleshooting Step

When electronic devices act strangely, a power cycle often helps. This is true for your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665. A power cycle is like restarting a computer. It clears out temporary glitches. It resets the internal computer system of the dishwasher. This can fix many minor electronic issues. If your control panel is unresponsive or frozen, a power cycle can be effective.

Performing a power cycle is a simple step. It does not require special tools. You only need to cut the power to the unit. Then you wait a short time before restoring power. This process can resolve many common problems. It is a good second step if the child lock is not the issue. Always try a power cycle before moving to more complex troubleshooting.

#### Why a Power Cycle Works

Your dishwasher has a small computer inside. This computer controls all its functions. Like any computer, it can sometimes get stuck. A power surge, a quick power flicker, or even a software glitch can cause this. The internal memory might hold incorrect information. This leads to unresponsive buttons or a "locked" state.

A power cycle cuts all electrical current to the dishwasher. This drains any residual power from its components. It forces the internal computer to restart. When the power comes back on, the system reboots. It starts fresh, clearing any temporary errors. This often restores normal function. It is a simple yet powerful fix.

#### How to Perform a Hard Reset Safely

Performing a power cycle, also known as a hard reset, is safe and easy. First, you must completely remove power from the dishwasher. There are two main ways to do this. The easiest way is to unplug the dishwasher from its electrical outlet. Pull it out slowly from the cabinet. You will see the power cord behind the unit.

If you cannot reach the plug, use your home's circuit breaker. Find your main electrical panel. Locate the breaker switch that controls your kitchen appliances or specifically the dishwasher. Flip this switch to the "off" position. Once power is cut, wait for at least 5 minutes. This ensures all residual power drains. After waiting, restore power by plugging it back in or flipping the breaker to "on."

#### What to Do After the Reset

After you restore power to your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665, observe it. The dishwasher might take a moment to power on. Its display panel should light up. Try to use the control panel buttons. See if they respond correctly. Attempt to start a wash cycle.

If the power cycle worked, the control panel should now be active. You should be able to select cycles and press "Start." If the dishwasher still appears locked or shows an error code, the problem might be more complex. Do not worry; we have more steps to try. But always check basic functions immediately after a reset.

### Interpreting Error Codes and Their Solutions for Your Model 665

Dishwashers often communicate problems through error codes. Your Kenmore Elite Model 665 is no different. When something goes wrong, a code might appear on the display. These codes are not just random numbers or letters. They are clues. Each code points to a specific issue. Understanding these codes helps you identify the problem. It allows you to find the correct solution.

Ignoring an error code can lead to bigger problems. It might also mean your dishwasher remains in a locked state. Learning to read these codes is a valuable skill. It can save you repair costs. It also helps you troubleshoot effectively. We will look at common codes and what they mean.

#### Locating the Error Code Display

When your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665 encounters a problem, it often displays an error code. This code appears on the digital display panel. This is the same panel where you see cycle times or other settings. The code might flash or remain steady. It usually consists of a letter followed by a number, like "F1" or "E4."

Sometimes, a general message like "LOC" or "CL" indicates a lock. Other codes indicate functional issues. Pay close attention to the display. Write down any codes you see. This information is crucial for diagnosis. It helps you pinpoint the exact problem your dishwasher faces.

#### Common Error Codes and What They Mean

Several error codes can appear on your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665. Some common ones include:

*   **"L" or "CL":** This indicates the control lock (child lock) is active. We discussed how to disable this earlier.
*   **"F1," "F2," etc. (Fault Codes):** These often relate to electronic issues. F1 might indicate a main control board problem. F2 could point to a temperature sensor fault.
*   **"OE" (Overflow Error):** This means there is too much water in the tub. The dishwasher stops to prevent flooding.
*   **"HE" (Heating Element Error):** The dishwasher cannot heat the water. This affects washing and drying performance.
*   **"LE" (Leak Error):** Water is detected leaking from the appliance. This code often triggers a stop.

Each code directs you to a specific area to inspect. Knowing these common codes helps you quickly understand the issue. You can then focus your troubleshooting efforts.

#### Basic Steps to Clear Specific Error Codes

Once you identify an error code, specific actions can often clear it. For "L" or "CL," follow the control lock deactivation steps. For other fault codes, start with a power cycle. Many electronic errors are temporary. A hard reset can clear them. If the code persists after a power cycle, then you need to investigate further.

For water-related codes like "OE" or "LE," check for clogs or leaks. Make sure the drain hose is clear. Look under the dishwasher for water. Correcting the underlying issue often clears the code automatically. If the problem is persistent, you might need to consult your dishwasher's manual.

### Addressing Physical Door Latch and Strike Plate Issues

Sometimes, your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665 might seem locked due to a physical problem. The door latch is a critical component. It keeps the door securely closed during operation. If the latch is faulty, the dishwasher cannot start. It will not run if the door is not fully closed. The dishwasher's safety mechanism prevents it from operating with an open door. This can make the entire unit appear unresponsive.

A broken or misaligned door latch can lead to your "locked" feeling. The control panel might not light up. The cycle might not begin. You need to inspect the latch carefully. Look for visible damage. Check its alignment with the strike plate. This physical check is important. It often reveals a simple mechanical fault.

#### Inspecting the Door Latch Mechanism

The door latch is located at the top center of your dishwasher door. It has moving parts. These parts engage with the strike plate on the dishwasher tub. Open the dishwasher door fully. Examine the latch mechanism. Look for any broken pieces. Check for cracks or bends in the plastic or metal parts.

Test the latch manually. Does it move freely? Does it snap into place? A weak spring or damaged components can prevent it from working. Sometimes, food debris or grime builds up inside the latch. This can stop it from closing correctly. Clean the area thoroughly. Ensure nothing blocks the latch's movement.

#### Checking the Strike Plate for Alignment or Damage

The strike plate is the part on the dishwasher tub that the door latch hooks into. It is usually a metal or plastic piece. This plate needs to align perfectly with the door latch. If the strike plate is bent or out of place, the latch cannot engage. This means the dishwasher does not sense the door is closed. It will not start.

Examine the strike plate on the top edge of the dishwasher opening. Look for any signs of damage. Is it bent? Is it loose? Sometimes, the screws holding it in place can loosen. This causes misalignment. Gently try to wiggle it. If it moves, tighten the screws. Proper alignment is key for the door to seal and lock correctly.

#### Cleaning and Lubricating the Latch System

A dirty or stiff latch can also cause problems. Over time, food particles, grease, or detergent residue can build up. This grime can stop the latch from moving smoothly. If the latch feels sticky or hard to operate, it needs cleaning.

Use a damp cloth and a mild degreaser. Clean all visible parts of the latch and strike plate. Pay attention to small crevices. Once clean, you might apply a small amount of food-grade silicone lubricant. This helps the moving parts slide easily. Do not use oil-based lubricants. They can attract more dirt. After cleaning and lubricating, test the latch several times. Ensure it moves freely and clicks firmly into place.

#### When to Consider Latch Replacement

If your door latch is visibly broken, bent, or severely worn, replacement might be necessary. A faulty latch often cannot be repaired. It must be swapped for a new one. Symptoms include the door not staying shut. You might also hear a clicking sound but no lock engagement. Sometimes, the dishwasher starts briefly then stops.

Replacing a door latch is a common DIY repair. You can usually purchase a replacement part online. Make sure you get the correct part for your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665. Disconnect power to the dishwasher before starting. Unscrew the old latch and install the new one. If you are unsure, calling a professional is a good idea.

### Dealing with Drainage Problems and Water Lockouts

Your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665 relies on proper water flow. This includes filling and draining. If the dishwasher cannot drain water correctly, it might enter a "locked" state. This is a safety feature. The machine stops to prevent flooding. It also avoids running without proper water levels. A full tub of dirty water can make the dishwasher unresponsive. It might seem stuck or locked.

Drainage issues are common. They can be caused by simple clogs. Filters, hoses, and air gaps can all become blocked. Addressing these problems can resolve the "locked" dishwasher. This helps the dishwasher resume normal operation.

#### How Drainage Issues Can Cause a "Lock"

A dishwasher that cannot drain water effectively will not start a new cycle. Many models have sensors. These sensors detect water levels. If the sensor sees water in the bottom of the tub, it signals a problem. The dishwasher’s computer prevents any new cycles from starting. This is to protect your home from water damage.

You might see an error code like "OE" (Overflow Error) or "LE" (Leak Error). Even without an error code, standing water indicates a drainage issue. The machine essentially locks itself until the water is gone. You must clear the water first. Then, you can address the drainage problem.

#### Checking and Cleaning the Dishwasher Filter

The dishwasher filter prevents food particles from clogging the drain pump. It is located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Over time, this filter collects debris. If it becomes too clogged, water cannot drain properly. This leads to standing water in the tub.

To clean the filter, first remove any standing water. Then, locate the filter assembly. It usually twists out or lifts up. Remove any large food particles. Rinse the filter under running water. Use a brush to scrub away stubborn grime. Reinstall the filter securely. Cleaning this filter regularly is good maintenance.

#### Inspecting the Drain Hose for Kinks or Clogs

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. This hose can develop kinks. It can also become clogged with food debris. A kinked hose restricts water flow. A clog completely blocks it. Both prevent proper drainage.

Pull the dishwasher out from the wall slightly if possible. Inspect the drain hose. Look for any sharp bends or kinks. Straighten them if you find any. Check the connection points to the sink drain or garbage disposal. Make sure they are not clogged. If you suspect a clog inside the hose, you may need to disconnect it. Then, clear the blockage with a stiff wire or plumbing snake.

#### Verifying the Air Gap (if applicable)

Some dishwasher installations include an air gap. This small cylinder sits on top of your sink. It prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If your air gap becomes clogged, it can impede drainage. Water might back up into the dishwasher or sink.

To check the air gap, remove its chrome cover. Unscrew or unclip the inner cap. Look for any debris inside. Clean out any food particles or grime. Ensure the small hoses connected to it are clear. A clogged air gap is a common but often overlooked cause of drainage issues. If you do not have an air gap, this step does not apply to your setup.

### Advanced Troubleshooting and Knowing When to Call a Professional

You have tried the basic steps. You checked the child lock. You performed a power cycle. You looked for error codes. You even inspected the door latch and drainage. Still, your Kenmore Elite Dishwasher Model 665 remains locked or unresponsive. This suggests a more complex problem. It might involve internal components. These include the control board or motor.

At this point, you might consider advanced troubleshooting. This often requires more technical knowledge. It may involve working with electrical components. Safety is paramount when dealing with these issues. Always disconnect power first. Knowing when to stop and call a professional is also important. This prevents further damage and ensures your safety.

#### When Simple Fixes Don't Work

If your dishwasher still does not unlock after trying common solutions, the problem is deeper. It is not just a simple user error or minor glitch. This means a component might have failed. The control board, door sensor, or even the main motor could be at fault. These parts require specific diagnostic steps. They often need replacement.

Do not get frustrated. Many appliance issues go beyond quick fixes. It is a sign that the machine requires more detailed attention. Prepare to either delve into technical repairs or seek expert help.

#### Potential Issues with the Control Board

The control board is the "brain" of your dishwasher. It controls all functions. If the control board malfunctions, the dishwasher can become unresponsive. It might appear locked. The board can fail due to power surges, age, or manufacturing defects. You might see strange behavior. This includes random lights or buttons that do not work.

Diagnosing a bad control board is hard. You often need to test it with a multimeter. This checks for proper voltage. Replacing a control board is also complex. It involves disconnecting many wires. This should only be attempted if you are confident with electrical repairs. Otherwise, it is best left to a professional.

#### Wiring and Sensor Malfunctions

Internal wiring can become loose or damaged. This happens from vibrations or wear. A loose wire can disrupt communication between components. It can cause a sensor to not send correct signals. For example, the door sensor tells the control board if the door is closed. If this sensor fails, the dishwasher will not start. It thinks the door is open, keeping it "locked."

Testing wiring and sensors requires specialized tools. You need a multimeter to check for continuity and resistance. Visually inspect wires for fraying or burn marks. If you find a damaged wire, it needs repair or replacement. Faulty sensors also need replacement. This is a job for someone experienced with appliance electronics.

#### Safety Precautions Before DIY Electrical Checks

Working with electrical appliances can be dangerous. Always prioritize safety. Before doing any internal checks, cut power to the dishwasher. Unplug it from the wall outlet. If you cannot reach the plug, turn off the circuit breaker for the dishwasher. Verify the power is off using a voltage tester.

Wear insulated gloves. Avoid touching live wires. Do not attempt repairs if you are uncomfortable or unsure. It is better to be safe. An electric shock can cause serious injury. Following safety precautions protects you. It also protects your appliance from further damage.

#### Deciding When Professional Service is Necessary

You have done your best. All basic and intermediate troubleshooting steps have failed. This is when you call a professional. Appliance repair technicians have specialized tools and training. They can quickly diagnose complex issues. They have access to specific diagnostic codes and service manuals. They can replace faulty control boards or
