## Restore Your Toms: How to Clean Them Effectively

Toms shoes are known for comfort and casual style. They become a go-to pair for many of us. Over time, these beloved shoes collect dirt, dust, and grime. Learning how to clean Toms shoes is essential. Proper cleaning helps maintain their appearance and extend their life. I understand wanting to keep your favorite Toms looking fresh. This guide shares simple steps to get them spotless again. We will cover different materials and cleaning methods.

### Takeaway

Keeping your Toms shoes clean is simple. Here is what you need to remember:
*   Identify your Toms material before cleaning.
*   Hand washing is often the safest method.
*   Spot treat stains quickly with mild cleaners.
*   Always air dry Toms away from direct heat.
*   Preventative care keeps your Toms looking better longer.

### How do you clean Toms shoes?

You clean Toms shoes by gently hand washing them with mild soap and water. This method works best for most fabric types like canvas. You can spot treat specific stains as needed. Always air dry your Toms to prevent damage and maintain their shape.

## Understanding Your Toms: Material Matters in Cleaning

Before you start cleaning, identify the material of your Toms shoes. Toms come in various fabrics. Each material requires a specific cleaning approach. Knowing your shoe's material helps prevent damage. This step ensures an effective clean.

Classic Toms are often made from canvas. Canvas is a durable, woven fabric. It handles light scrubbing well. You can usually use a mild soap and water solution on canvas. It is important to avoid harsh chemicals.

Some Toms feature crochet designs. These are more delicate. Crochet requires a very gentle touch. You must avoid pulling the threads. Use cold water and minimal rubbing for crochet Toms.

Toms also come in suede, leather, or glitter finishes. Suede needs specialized cleaning brushes and sprays. Leather Toms benefit from specific leather cleaners and conditioners. Glitter shoes require careful spot cleaning to avoid losing sparkle. Always check the care label inside your Toms if available. This label often gives you hints on the best cleaning method.

## The Gentle Hand Wash Method for Classic Canvas Toms

Hand washing is the safest way to clean most classic canvas Toms. This method prevents damage that machine washing might cause. I have found this approach effective for keeping my canvas Toms fresh. You need just a few simple items.

Start by gathering your supplies. You will need a soft brush or old toothbrush, a clean cloth, mild laundry detergent or dish soap, and a small bowl of cold water. Remove any loose dirt from your shoes. You can clap the soles together outside. Use the soft brush to gently remove surface debris.

Next, prepare your cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of mild detergent with cold water in the bowl. Dip your brush or cloth into the solution. Gently scrub the canvas in small sections. Focus on stained areas. For more stubborn dirt, you might need a little more pressure. However, be careful not to rub too hard. This can damage the fabric. If your canvas Toms are white, you might consider methods used for [how to clean white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes) for extra brightening. Rinse your cloth frequently in clean water. Wipe away soap residue from the shoes. Continue this process until the shoes look clean.

Remember to be gentle around the espadrille sole if your Toms have one. This part often has a braided rope-like material. It can absorb water and take longer to dry. Excessive wetting can weaken the glue. A damp cloth is best for cleaning this area.

## Tackling Tough Stains and Odors on Toms

Toms are comfortable, but they can collect tough stains and odors. Addressing these issues quickly helps keep your shoes looking and smelling good. I have learned that immediate action is key for stain removal. Do not let stains set in.

For general dirt and mud, first let the mud dry completely. Once dry, you can gently brush off the excess. Then, proceed with the hand washing method. For deeper mud stains, methods used for [how to clean muddy shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-muddy-shoes) might be helpful before a full wash. For common stains like food or drink, a simple spot treatment often works wonders. Mix a tiny bit of mild dish soap with water. Apply it directly to the stain using a clean cloth or a soft brush. Gently blot and rub the area. Rinse the cloth and wipe the area again to remove soap residue. Repeat if necessary. For persistent stains, you might find more advanced techniques in guides on [how to clean stained shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes).

Odors are another common issue with frequently worn shoes. Toms, especially, can develop a smell inside. This happens from sweat and bacteria buildup. To combat odors, sprinkle baking soda inside your dry Toms. Let it sit overnight. Baking soda absorbs smells effectively. In the morning, shake out the powder. You can also place dryer sheets inside the shoes for a fresh scent. For a deeper clean of the inside, consider practices described in [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes). If the odor persists, you may need a more thorough treatment for [how to clean smelly shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes). This could involve a vinegar solution or specialized shoe deodorizers. Always ensure the shoes are completely dry after any cleaning to prevent new odors or mold growth. If you notice mold, follow steps for [how to clean mold off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes).

## Special Care for Crochet, Suede, and Glitter Toms

Some Toms models feature materials that require extra special care. Crochet, suede, and glitter Toms are not treated like simple canvas. Mishandling these materials can cause permanent damage. Always approach these shoes with caution.

Crochet Toms are delicate. They have an open-weave pattern. Machine washing can distort the shape or unravel the threads. Instead, opt for spot cleaning or very gentle hand washing. Use cold water and a very mild soap. A soft cloth or sponge is better than a brush. Lightly blot the soiled areas. Avoid scrubbing, which can pull the delicate fibers. Rinse by gently dabbing with a damp, clean cloth. Allow them to air dry completely. Stuff them with paper towels to maintain their shape.

Suede Toms require specialized care. Water can stain suede permanently. Do not use water and soap like you would on canvas. Instead, use a suede brush to remove loose dirt and scuffs. Brush in one direction to lift the nap. For stains, a suede eraser can often lift marks. If deep cleaning is needed, use a dedicated suede cleaner spray. Follow the product instructions carefully. Always test a small, inconspicuous area first. For detailed instructions on removing dirt, refer to guides on [how to clean dirt off suede shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dirt-off-suede-shoes).

Glitter Toms also need a gentle touch. Excessive scrubbing or harsh chemicals can remove the glitter. Spot clean these shoes with a barely damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid rubbing vigorously. Focus on blotting stains. If possible, avoid getting the glitter areas wet. Dry them quickly with a clean towel. Let them air dry away from direct heat. This helps preserve their sparkle.

## Machine Washing Toms: When and How to Do It Safely

Many people wonder if they can machine wash their Toms. Generally, machine washing is not recommended for Toms. It can damage the shoe's structure, fade colors, or loosen the espadrille sole. However, if your Toms are heavily soiled canvas and hand washing is not enough, machine washing might be an option. This should be a last resort. I have personally used this method for very dirty canvas Toms, but I always take extreme precautions.

If you decide to machine wash, follow these steps very carefully to minimize risk:

1.  **Remove Loose Dirt:** Before placing them in the washer, brush off any loose dirt or mud. Clap the soles together to dislodge debris.
2.  **Use a Laundry Bag:** Place your Toms inside a mesh laundry bag or a pillowcase. This protects them from banging around in the machine. It also prevents the espadrille soles from unraveling.
3.  **Cold Water, Gentle Cycle:** Set your washing machine to a cold water, delicate, or gentle cycle. Hot water can shrink the fabric or weaken glues.
4.  **Mild Detergent:** Use a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid bleach or harsh chemicals. They can damage the fabric and color.
5.  **Wash Separately or with Towels:** Wash your Toms alone or with a few old towels. The towels can provide cushioning. This helps prevent the shoes from thudding loudly during the cycle.
6.  **No Agitator:** If your washing machine has an agitator, consider placing the shoes on either side of it. This prevents them from getting caught and damaged. For more general advice on cleaning shoes in a washer, refer to guides on [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer).

Remember, machine washing carries a risk. It may void any warranty. Hand washing is always the safest method.

## Drying Your Toms Correctly: A Crucial Step

Proper drying is as important as proper cleaning for your Toms shoes. Incorrect drying can lead to shrinkage, damage to the sole, or lingering odors. Never put your Toms in a clothes dryer. The heat can cause irreversible damage. I always air dry my Toms. This ensures they maintain their shape and integrity.

After washing, gently press out excess water from your Toms. Do not wring or twist them. This can distort their shape. You can pat them with a clean towel to absorb more moisture. For fabric Toms, such as canvas or crochet, stuff them with paper towels or clean old rags. This helps absorb internal moisture. It also helps them keep their original shape as they dry. Change the paper towels periodically if they become very damp.

Place your Toms in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Direct sun can fade colors. High heat can shrink materials or melt glues. An indoor spot with good airflow or a shaded outdoor area is ideal. A fan can help speed up the drying process. Ensure the shoes are completely dry before you wear or store them. This usually takes 24 to 48 hours, depending on humidity. Wearing damp Toms can lead to new odors or mildew growth. Drying them thoroughly is vital for shoe health.

## Maintaining Your Toms: Tips for Longevity and Freshness

Cleaning your Toms is important, but consistent maintenance helps them last even longer. Preventative steps can reduce how often you need to deep clean. I practice these habits to keep my favorite pairs in top condition. These tips also ensure your Toms stay fresh.

Regular brushing is a simple maintenance step. Use a soft brush to remove dust and loose dirt after each wear. This prevents grime from building up. For canvas Toms, a stiff brush works well on the soles. For more delicate materials like suede, use a specialized suede brush. This quick habit takes seconds but makes a big difference.

Rotate your shoes. Do not wear the same pair of Toms every day. Giving your shoes a break allows them to air out completely. This reduces moisture buildup. Reduced moisture means less odor and less bacteria growth. Having multiple pairs of shoes extends the life of each pair significantly.

Consider using a fabric protector spray for canvas Toms. These sprays create a barrier against stains and water. Apply the spray according to product instructions. Test it on an inconspicuous area first. This protective layer can make future cleaning much easier. Reapply as needed.

Address odors before they become a problem. If your Toms start to smell, sprinkle baking soda inside them overnight. This absorbs moisture and neutralizes smells. You can also use cedar shoe inserts. Cedar wood naturally absorbs moisture and has a pleasant scent. For more persistent odor issues, refer to methods for [how to clean smelly shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes). Proper storage is also important. Keep your Toms in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing them in damp environments where mold can grow. By following these maintenance tips, your Toms will stay clean and fresh.
