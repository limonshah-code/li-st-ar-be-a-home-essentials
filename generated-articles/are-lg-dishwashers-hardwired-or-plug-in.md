### Understanding Dishwasher Power Connections

Dishwashers need electricity to operate. There are two primary ways these appliances connect to your home's power supply. Each method has its own installation steps and benefits. It is important to know the difference before you start any work.

#### What is a Hardwired Connection?

A hardwired connection means the dishwasher's electrical wires connect directly to your home's circuit. There is no plug involved. An electrician permanently joins the appliance wires to the house wiring inside a junction box. This type of connection often results in a cleaner, more integrated look. It also prevents accidental disconnections. Many older homes and some new builds have hardwired connections as the standard. You can learn more about general dishwasher connections by visiting our guide on [do dishwashers plug in or are they hardwired](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-dishwashers-plug-in-or-are-they-hardwired).

#### What is a Plug-In Connection?

A plug-in connection uses a standard electrical cord. This cord has a three-prong plug on one end. The plug goes into a dedicated 120-volt wall outlet. This method offers flexibility. It makes installation simpler for many homeowners. You can easily disconnect the appliance if you need to move it or perform maintenance. Modern kitchens often feature outlets beneath the sink for this purpose. If you're wondering about the specifics, check out our article on [do dishwashers have plugs or are they hardwired](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-dishwashers-have-plugs-or-are-they-hardwired).

### The LG Dishwasher Standard: Often Hardwired

When you purchase a new LG dishwasher, you will typically find it configured for a hardwired installation. This means the appliance usually comes with a conduit and wiring pigtail, but no actual plug attached. The pigtail contains the three wires needed for a direct connection: live, neutral, and ground. This setup requires you to connect these wires directly to your home's electrical supply.

LG designs many of its dishwashers this way for several reasons. Hardwiring can provide a more secure and reliable electrical connection. It also aligns with common electrical codes in various regions. However, this standard configuration does not mean you are limited to only hardwiring. LG understands that different homes have different electrical setups.

If your kitchen has an accessible outlet for the dishwasher, you can convert your LG unit to a plug-in model. This conversion requires a separate LG power cord kit. You install this kit onto the dishwasher's electrical box. The kit provides the necessary cord and plug. This option gives you flexibility to choose the best connection for your specific kitchen. Knowing that [an LG dishwasher can be hardwired](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-lg-dishwasher-be-hardwired) directly from the factory is key.

### Advantages of a Hardwired LG Dishwasher

Choosing a hardwired connection for your LG dishwasher offers several distinct advantages. Many homeowners and professionals prefer this method for its reliability and appearance. Let's explore why hardwiring might be the best choice for your kitchen.

First, hardwiring provides a very secure connection. Since the wires are permanently joined, there is no risk of the plug coming loose. This reduces the chance of accidental disconnections or power interruptions during a wash cycle. A stable connection ensures consistent power delivery to your appliance.

Second, a hardwired setup often looks cleaner. There are no visible cords running to an outlet. The electrical connection is hidden away in the junction box. This gives your kitchen a more integrated and streamlined appearance. This can be important in modern kitchen designs.

Third, hardwired dishwashers typically operate on a dedicated circuit. This means the dishwasher has its own breaker in your electrical panel. A dedicated circuit prevents overloading. It also minimizes the risk of tripping breakers when other appliances are in use. This enhances electrical safety for your home. You can read our detailed guide on [how to install hardwired dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-hardwired-dishwasher) for more insights.

Finally, hardwired installations often meet specific local electrical codes more readily. Some building codes may even require hardwiring for built-in appliances like dishwashers. Consulting local codes or a qualified electrician is always a good idea. They can ensure your installation complies with all regulations.

### Benefits of a Plug-In LG Dishwasher Connection

While hardwiring offers strong benefits, a plug-in connection for your LG dishwasher also has its own set of advantages. This option provides greater flexibility and often simplifies the installation process. Let's look at why a plug-in setup might be ideal for your home.

One major benefit is easier installation. If you already have a dedicated 120-volt outlet under your sink, installing a plug-in dishwasher is straightforward. You simply connect the power cord to the dishwasher and plug it into the outlet. This often saves time and the cost of hiring an electrician for direct wiring. This DIY-friendly approach appeals to many homeowners.

Another advantage is simplified maintenance and troubleshooting. If you need to move the dishwasher for repair or cleaning, you just unplug it. There is no need to disconnect wires from a junction box. This makes appliance removal much quicker and safer for non-electricians. For instance, if you need to access the back of the unit, unplugging is simple.

A plug-in connection also offers portability. While dishwashers are usually permanent fixtures, having a plug means you could move the appliance more easily if needed. This is useful during kitchen renovations or if you plan to take your appliance with you when you move. It provides more options than a fixed hardwired unit. You should know [where does dishwasher plug go in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-does-dishwasher-plug-go-in) for proper installation.

Finally, a plug-in setup can be beneficial if you are renting. Landlords may prefer plug-in appliances. This prevents permanent alterations to their electrical systems. It ensures compliance with lease agreements. Always check with your landlord before making any electrical modifications.

### How to Determine Your LG Dishwasher's Setup

Before you start any installation or conversion work, you need to determine your specific LG dishwasher's connection type. You also need to assess your home's existing electrical setup. This step ensures safety and prevents potential issues. Knowing what you have will guide your next actions.

First, check the owner's manual for your LG dishwasher. The manual provides specific information about its power requirements and installation options. It will clearly state whether the model is designed for hardwiring or if it includes a plug. It will also mention if a power cord kit is sold separately. The model number is crucial for finding the correct manual online if you no longer have the physical copy.

Next, physically inspect your current dishwasher or the new LG unit. If it's a new unit, look at the back where the electrical connection is made. If you see bare wires enclosed in a metal conduit, it is set up for hardwiring. If you see a standard three-prong electrical cord already attached, it is a plug-in model.

For an existing dishwasher, look underneath the kitchen sink or behind the appliance if accessible. You are looking for the electrical connection point. If there is a power cord plugged into an outlet, it is a plug-in unit. If you see wires disappearing into a junction box or directly into the wall, it is hardwired. Our guide on [how to tell if dishwasher is hardwired](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-if-dishwasher-is-hardwired) offers further assistance.

Finally, inspect the electrical outlet itself, if applicable. Ensure it is a dedicated 120-volt, three-prong grounded outlet. Do not use extension cords with dishwashers. Extension cords are not safe for high-power appliances. Always prioritize safety in all electrical checks.

### Installation Considerations for Both Types

Installing an LG dishwasher, whether hardwired or plug-in, requires careful attention to detail and safety. Proper installation ensures your appliance functions correctly and safely for years.
