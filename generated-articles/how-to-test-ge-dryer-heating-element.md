## How To Test GE Dryer Heating Element

Has your GE dryer stopped drying clothes effectively? Perhaps it runs, but the clothes stay cold and damp. I understand how frustrating a dryer that doesn't heat can be, especially with laundry piling up. Often, the main reason for a lack of heat is a faulty heating element. Don't worry, you can diagnose this common problem yourself.

In this guide, I will walk you through the process to test your GE dryer heating element. We will cover important safety measures, the tools you need, and step-by-step instructions for performing a continuity test. By the end, you will know if your heating element needs replacing. This helps you save money on service calls and get your laundry routine back on track.

### Takeaway

*   Always disconnect power before starting any dryer repair.
*   A multimeter is essential for testing heating element continuity.
*   A good heating element shows continuity (a reading of 0-20 ohms).
*   No continuity (OL or infinity) means the element is bad.
*   Visual inspection helps identify obvious damage.

### How do you test a GE dryer heating element?

You test a GE dryer heating element using a multimeter set to the ohms (立) setting. Disconnect the dryer's power, access the heating element, and touch the multimeter probes to its terminals. A reading between 0 and 20 ohms indicates a good element. No reading (OL or infinity) means the element is faulty and needs replacement.

## Understanding Your GE Dryer's Heating System

Your GE dryer relies on a few key components to produce the heat needed for drying clothes. The heating element is central to this process. It is essentially a large, coiled wire designed to generate significant heat when electricity passes through it. Think of it like a giant toaster element inside your dryer.

When your dryer runs a cycle, the control board sends power to the heating element. As the element heats up, a blower motor circulates air through the element and then through the drum. This hot, circulating air helps evaporate moisture from your wet clothes. Without a functioning heating element, your dryer will just tumble clothes in cold air, leaving them wet.

Common symptoms of a failing GE dryer heating element include clothes taking too long to dry, clothes remaining damp after a full cycle, or the dryer running but producing no heat at all. Sometimes, you might even smell a burning odor if the element is shorting out. If you notice any of these signs, testing the heating element is a logical next step in your troubleshooting process. Always make sure to prioritize safety before beginning any repair work on your appliance.

## Essential Tools for Testing a GE Dryer Heating Element

Before you begin testing your GE dryer's heating element, you need to gather the right tools. Having everything ready saves time and ensures a smooth process. Most of these items are common household tools or can be easily found at a hardware store.

First, and most important, is a **multimeter**. This device measures electrical properties like voltage, current, and resistance (ohms). For testing a heating element, you will use the resistance or continuity setting. A digital multimeter is often easier to read than an analog one. It will show a clear number or "OL" (open loop) to indicate continuity or lack thereof.

Next, you will need a few **screwdrivers**. Both Philips head and flathead screwdrivers are typically necessary to open dryer panels and access components. Sometimes, a nut driver set or a socket wrench set might also be useful, depending on your specific GE dryer model. You should also have a **pair of work gloves** to protect your hands from sharp edges inside the dryer. Safety glasses are also a good idea. A **small container** or magnetic tray is helpful for holding screws you remove, preventing them from getting lost. These tools ensure you can safely and effectively access and test the GE dryer heating element.

## Safety First: Disconnecting Power and Accessing the Element

Safety is the absolute top priority when working with any electrical appliance. Never attempt to service your GE dryer without first disconnecting its power source. Electricity can cause serious injury or even be fatal. I always emphasize this step because it is the most critical part of any appliance repair.

To disconnect power, locate your dryer's power cord and unplug it from the wall outlet. If your dryer is hardwired, or if you cannot reach the plug, you must go to your home's circuit breaker panel. Find the breaker labeled for your laundry room or dryer and flip it to the "OFF" position. It is also wise to put a piece of tape over the breaker or a note to prevent someone from accidentally turning it back on while you are working.

Once the power is confirmed off, you can start accessing the heating element. GE dryer designs vary, but typically, you will need to remove the back panel of the dryer to get to the heating element. Use your screwdriver to remove the screws holding this panel in place. Carefully set the screws aside in your container. Gently pull the panel away. You may also need to remove ducting or other components that block access to the element housing. The heating element is usually housed in a large, often cylindrical, metal casing near the bottom rear of the dryer. This safe access allows you to move to the next step. You can find more general guidance on accessing dryer components in guides like [how to test an electric dryer heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-electric-dryer-heating-element).

## Visual Inspection of the GE Dryer Heating Element

After you have safely disconnected the power and gained access to your GE dryer's heating element, your next step is to perform a thorough visual inspection. This initial check can often reveal obvious problems without needing any testing tools. I always recommend this step because it saves time if the issue is clearly visible.

Carefully examine the heating element coils themselves. They are typically made of a nichrome wire and should appear intact and smooth. Look for any breaks, kinks, or dark spots on the coils. A healthy heating element will have uniform coiling throughout. A common sign of failure is a visible break in the wire, where the coil has snapped. This break prevents electricity from flowing, meaning no heat.

Also, check for any signs of burning, charring, or excessive discoloration on the coils or the surrounding insulation. This can indicate that the element has overheated or shorted out. Pay attention to the ceramic insulators that hold the coils in place. These should not be cracked or broken. If you see clear physical damage like a broken coil, severe discoloration, or burnt spots, the heating element is very likely the problem. It will need replacement regardless of further electrical tests. This visual confirmation often tells you exactly what needs to be done.

## Using a Multimeter to Test the GE Dryer Heating Element for Continuity

Now that you have accessed the heating element and performed a visual check, it's time to use your multimeter for a precise test. This is where you determine if electricity can flow through the element. A multimeter test for continuity is the most accurate way to confirm if your GE dryer heating element is functioning correctly or if it has an internal break. I will guide you through setting up your multimeter and interpreting its readings.

First, make sure your multimeter is set to the **ohms (立) setting**. This setting measures electrical resistance. Some multimeters have a dedicated continuity setting, often indicated by a symbol resembling a sound wave or a diode. If yours has this, use it, as it will usually beep when continuity is present. Ensure the probes are correctly plugged into the multimeter: the black probe into the "COM" (common) port and the red probe into the "V立mA" or "立" port.

Next, locate the two terminals on the heating element. These are the points where the wires connect to the element. Before testing, disconnect any wires attached to these terminals. You want to test the element itself, not the circuit around it. Touch one multimeter probe to each terminal of the heating element. Do not touch the probes to each other or to anything else during the test.

Observe the reading on your multimeter's screen.
*   **Good Heating Element:** A good GE dryer heating element will show a reading of **between 0 and 20 ohms**. This low resistance indicates that the circuit is complete, and electricity can flow through the element to create heat. The exact number can vary slightly between models, but it should be a low, stable number. If you are using the continuity setting, the multimeter will likely beep continuously, confirming the circuit is closed.
*   **Bad Heating Element:** If the multimeter displays "OL" (Open Loop), "infinity," or no change from when the probes are not touching anything (indicating an open circuit), the heating element is faulty. This means there is a break in the coil, and electricity cannot flow, preventing it from heating. In this case, your GE dryer heating element needs to be replaced.

Performing this test correctly ensures you accurately diagnose the issue.

## Testing Thermostats and Thermal Fuses (Related Components)

Even if your GE dryer heating element tests fine, your dryer might still not be producing heat. This is why it's important to also check related components, specifically the thermostats and thermal fuses. These parts act as safety devices. They prevent your dryer from overheating and can shut down the heating circuit if a problem occurs. I always recommend testing these alongside the heating element.

GE dryers typically have several thermostats and at least one thermal fuse. The **cycling thermostat** regulates the temperature inside the dryer drum. It turns the heating element on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The **high-limit thermostat** is a safety device. It trips and cuts power to the heating element if the temperature gets too high, preventing a fire. The **thermal fuse** is a one-time safety device. If it blows, it permanently cuts power to the heating circuit. This means the dryer will no longer heat until the fuse is replaced.

To test these components, you will use your multimeter in the same way you tested the heating element: set it to the continuity or ohms setting. Disconnect the wires from each thermostat or thermal fuse before testing. Touch one multimeter probe to each terminal of the component.
*   **Good Component:** A good thermostat or thermal fuse should show **continuity (0 ohms or a very low reading)**. This means electricity can pass through it. If you are using the continuity setting, the multimeter should beep.
*   **Bad Component:** If the multimeter displays "OL" (Open Loop) or "infinity," the component is bad and has an open circuit. A blown thermal fuse will always show "OL." A tripped high-limit thermostat might also show "OL" but some can reset. However, if it shows "OL" it needs replacing.

If any of these safety components test as "open," they are faulty and need replacement. A common reason for a thermal fuse to blow is restricted airflow, often due to a clogged dryer vent. If you replace a fuse, always check your dryer's vent for blockages. For issues where your GE dryer is not heating, troubleshooting these components can be key to finding the real cause. You might find related information on solving common heating issues by looking into [how to reset a GE dryer not heating](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-ge-dryer-not-heating). This helps cover all bases for a proper diagnosis.

## Troubleshooting Other GE Dryer No-Heat Issues

While a faulty GE dryer heating element, thermostat, or thermal fuse are the most common culprits for a no-heat problem, other issues can also prevent your dryer from producing warmth. It's important to consider these possibilities if your tests on the heating components come back positive. I've seen many cases where people replace the heating element only to find the problem persists because another part was overlooked.

One significant cause of no heat is **restricted airflow**. A clogged lint screen or a blocked dryer vent can severely impede airflow. This not only prevents efficient drying but also causes the dryer to overheat. When the dryer overheats, safety components like the thermal fuse or high-limit thermostat can trip. Even if the heating element is fine, the lack of airflow means hot air cannot circulate effectively to dry clothes. Regularly cleaning your lint trap and inspecting your dryer vent for blockages are crucial preventative measures.

For gas GE dryers, the heating system is different. Instead of an electric heating element, they use an igniter and a gas valve to produce heat. If your gas dryer is not heating, you might have a faulty **igniter** that cannot light the gas, or a problem with the **gas valve coils** that prevent gas from flowing. These components also require testing for continuity, but the process is specific to gas dryers. It's also possible for the **motor** to run, but if its internal centrifugal switch is faulty, it might not provide power to the heating circuit.

Finally, a problem with the dryer's **timer or control board** can also lead to no heat. If the control board is not sending power to the heating element, then the element will not activate, regardless of its condition. These are less common failures than the heating element or thermal fuse but are worth considering if all other tests pass. Thoroughly checking all potential causes ensures you correctly identify and fix your GE dryer's heating issue.

## Replacing a Faulty GE Dryer Heating Element

If your multimeter test confirms that your GE dryer heating element is faulty, or if your visual inspection revealed a clear break, the next step is to replace it. This is a common DIY repair that can save you money compared to hiring a professional. I've guided many people through this process, and it's quite manageable with the right steps.

First, ensure you have the correct replacement part. GE dryer heating elements are specific to certain models, so always verify your dryer's model number and cross-reference it with the part number. You can usually find the model number inside the dryer door or on a label on the back panel. Ordering the wrong part will only delay your repair.

To replace the element, you will follow the access steps you used for testing. Make sure the dryer is unplugged. Remove the back panel. Carefully disconnect the wires attached to the old heating element's terminals. Pay attention to how they are connected; taking a picture with your phone can be helpful. The heating element is usually held in place by a few screws or clips within its housing. Remove these fasteners. Gently slide the old heating element out of its housing.

Now, take your new GE dryer heating element. Carefully slide it into the housing, ensuring it sits correctly. Secure it with the screws or clips you removed earlier. Reconnect the wires to the terminals in the same way they were originally. Double-check all connections to ensure they are secure. Finally, reattach the dryer's back panel and secure it with its screws. Plug the dryer back into the wall outlet or restore power at the circuit breaker. Run a test cycle to ensure the dryer now heats properly. If the element was the problem, your dryer should now be blowing hot air and drying clothes efficiently.
