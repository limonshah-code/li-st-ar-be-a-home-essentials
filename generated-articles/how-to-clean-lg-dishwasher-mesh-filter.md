## Cleaning Your LG Dishwasher Mesh Filter for Better Performance

Have you noticed your LG dishwasher not cleaning dishes as well as it used to? Maybe there are food particles left behind, or a strange smell comes from the appliance. I understand how frustrating this can be. Often, the hidden culprit is a dirty mesh filter. Knowing how to clean LG dishwasher mesh filter is a vital step in maintaining your appliance.

This filter traps food debris and prevents it from recirculating onto your dishes. Over time, it collects grease, food scraps, and grime. A clogged filter impacts wash performance and can cause odors. Regular cleaning keeps your dishwasher working its best. I will guide you through the simple steps needed to clean your LG dishwasher's mesh filter. You will learn about the tools you need, how to remove the filter, and how to put it back. This guide helps you keep your LG dishwasher running smoothly.

### Takeaway

To ensure your LG dishwasher performs optimally, clean its mesh filter regularly.
*   Locate the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher.
*   Twist and lift the cylindrical filter, then separate the mesh screen.
*   Rinse both parts under warm running water.
*   Use a soft brush and dish soap to scrub away stubborn debris.
*   Rinse thoroughly and reassemble, placing the mesh screen first, then the cylindrical filter.

### Clear Answer

To clean your LG dishwasher mesh filter, first locate it at the bottom of the tub. Twist and remove the cylindrical filter, then separate the mesh screen. Rinse both components under warm running water. Scrub gently with a soft brush and dish soap to remove food debris and grease. Rinse completely, then reinsert them correctly.

## Why Cleaning Your LG Dishwasher Mesh Filter Matters

Your LG dishwasher works hard to get dishes spotless. A key part of this process is the mesh filter. This component catches food particles during the wash cycle. If you neglect this filter, problems will arise. I often see people overlook this simple task.

A dirty filter stops water from draining properly. It also allows food bits to redeposit onto clean dishes. Imagine unloading dishes that feel gritty or have visible residue. This is a common sign of a clogged filter. Additionally, trapped food debris begins to decompose. This creates unpleasant odors inside your dishwasher. The smell can transfer to your dishes, too. Nobody wants a stinky dishwasher or smelly plates.

Regular cleaning helps your dishwasher perform at its best. It ensures efficient water circulation. This means cleaner dishes with every cycle. It also prevents strain on the dishwasher's pump and motor. Keeping the filter clean helps extend the life of your appliance. A clean filter is a happy dishwasher, and that means happy you.

## Understanding Your LG Dishwasher Filter System

LG dishwashers use a multi-part filter system. This system includes a cylindrical filter and a flat mesh screen. Both parts work together to trap food debris. The cylindrical filter is usually easy to spot. It sits in the center of the dishwasher's bottom. This coarse filter catches larger food particles. Think of it as the first line of defense.

Underneath or surrounding the cylindrical part is the mesh screen. This fine filter catches smaller bits of food. It prevents tiny particles from recirculating. Together, they ensure water gets filtered before it sprays onto your dishes. This design helps keep your dishes clean and free of specks. It also helps prevent drain clogs.

Understanding these parts helps you clean them correctly. You must remove both pieces to clean them properly. Many dishwashers have similar filter designs. Knowing how the parts fit helps when it's time to put them back. If you want to know more about how filters work in general, you can find information on how to clean a filter in a dishwasher.

## Gathering Your Tools for Filter Cleaning

Before you start cleaning, gather a few simple items. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. You likely already own most of these tools. I find that preparation saves time and effort. This simple setup ensures you can effectively clean your LG dishwasher mesh filter.

First, you will need dish soap. Any standard dish soap works well. It helps cut through grease and grime. Next, grab a soft-bristled brush. An old toothbrush is perfect for this task. It reaches into small spaces without damaging the delicate mesh. You will also need a sink with running water. Warm water helps rinse away debris. A towel is useful for wiping up any spills.

Sometimes, stubborn buildup requires a soak. A small bucket or basin can be helpful for this. You might also want gloves if you prefer not to touch food residue. These simple tools ensure you can thoroughly clean the filter parts. Having them ready makes the job quicker. This prepares you for a successful cleaning session.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Your LG Dishwasher Mesh Filter

Removing your LG dishwasher filter is a straightforward process. You do not need special tools or skills. I always start by making sure the dishwasher is empty. This prevents dishes from getting in the way. It also makes it easier to access the filter.

First, open the dishwasher door completely. Look down at the bottom of the tub. You will see the filter assembly. It usually sits in the center, near the spray arm. LG filters often have a handle or arrow indicating how to turn them. Gently twist the top cylindrical filter counter-clockwise. You should feel it loosen. Once loose, carefully lift it straight up and out.

Next, you will see the flat mesh screen underneath. This piece usually lifts right out. Some models might have a small tab to press. Be gentle as you remove these parts. They are designed to be removable for cleaning. If you are unsure, consult your dishwasher's manual. Remember which part goes where. This helps when it is time to put it back. When you're ready to put it back, I've found that knowing [how to put dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in) can be very helpful.

## Deep Cleaning Your LG Dishwasher Mesh Filter

Once you have removed the filter parts, it is time for a thorough cleaning. This step removes all the trapped food and grease. I always clean the filter immediately after removal. Fresh debris is easier to remove than dried-on gunk.

Take both filter parts to your sink. Hold them under warm running water. Use the soft-bristled brush to scrub the mesh and plastic surfaces. Pay close attention to the fine mesh screen. Food particles often get stuck in these tiny holes. Apply a small amount of dish soap to your brush. Scrub vigorously but gently. This helps break down grease and sticky residues. Rinse both parts thoroughly to remove all soap and debris. Make sure no soap residue remains.

For stubborn buildup, you can soak the filter. Fill a small basin with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Let the filter parts soak for 10-15 minutes. This softens dried-on food. After soaking, repeat the scrubbing and rinsing process. Ensure the mesh is completely clear. You should be able to see through it easily. This deep clean ensures optimal performance.

## Cleaning the Filter Housing and Sump Area

While the filter parts are out, take a moment to clean the filter housing. This is the area inside the dishwasher where the filter sits. It also includes the sump area at the very bottom. Food debris can collect here too, even with a functioning filter. This step is important for a complete clean.

Look into the hole where you removed the cylindrical filter. You might see some food bits or standing water. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe out any visible debris. Reach as far as you can comfortably. Be careful around any moving parts. You can use a small amount of dish soap on the cloth for sticky grime. Rinse the area lightly with a little water if needed.

Check the bottom of the dishwasher tub around the filter area. Sometimes, food particles accumulate here. Wipe down the entire bottom surface. This prevents new debris from entering the filter area. A clean sump ensures proper draining. It also helps prevent odors from developing. This thorough cleaning ensures no hidden grime remains.

## Properly Reinstalling Your LG Dishwasher Filter

Reinstalling the LG dishwasher filter is just as important as removing it. Proper placement ensures the filter works correctly. It also prevents leaks or damage to the dishwasher. I always make sure the parts are completely dry before putting them back. This helps prevent mold or mildew growth.

First, take the clean mesh screen. Place it back into the filter housing at the bottom of the dishwasher. Ensure it sits flat and flush. There might be specific grooves or guides for it. Next, take the cylindrical filter. Align its tabs or arrows with the corresponding slots in the housing. Gently push it down into place.

Once seated, twist the cylindrical filter clockwise. You should feel it lock securely. It should be snug but not overtightened. The filter should not wiggle or lift easily. A properly reinstalled filter ensures water flows correctly. It also ensures the filter catches debris as it should. Double-check its stability. This simple step helps maintain your dishwasher's efficiency.

## Frequency and Best Practices for LG Dishwasher Filter Maintenance

Maintaining your LG dishwasher filter regularly is key to its longevity. I often get asked how often to clean it. The frequency depends on how often you use your dishwasher and what you wash. For most households, cleaning the mesh filter once a month is a good starting point. If you wash heavily soiled dishes or use your dishwasher daily, consider cleaning it every two weeks. You can also monitor your dishwasher's performance. If dishes are not getting clean, or you notice smells, check the filter.

Beyond regular cleaning, adopt some best practices. Scrape large food particles off plates before loading them. You do not need to pre-rinse everything. But removing large chunks helps the filter. This reduces the amount of debris the filter has to catch. Also, avoid washing items with excessive grease. Heavy grease can build up on the filter quickly.

Periodically, run a cleaning cycle with a dishwasher cleaner. This helps clean the entire interior, including hard-to-reach areas. This combination of filter cleaning and general maintenance keeps your LG dishwasher in top shape. Regular care saves you from bigger problems later. Understanding how often you should clean your dishwasher filter can truly extend its life.

## Troubleshooting Common LG Dishwasher Filter Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps you address problems quickly. I have seen common issues related to the dishwasher filter. Most can be fixed with a few simple checks.

One common problem is a bad smell from the dishwasher. This usually means food particles are trapped and decaying. If your filter is clean, check the sump area. Food could be hiding there. Also, ensure you are using enough detergent. Insufficient detergent can lead to residue buildup. Another issue is poor cleaning performance. If dishes come out dirty or gritty, the filter might be clogged. Even a partially clogged filter can reduce spray arm effectiveness. Re-clean the filter thoroughly. Make sure no tiny holes are blocked.

Sometimes, a dishwasher does not drain properly. While many factors cause this, a clogged filter can contribute. The filter prevents water from reaching the drain pump effectively. Check for blockages in the filter and housing. If your dishwasher filter is full of water, this can indicate a draining problem related to the filter or further down the line. If these steps do not work, consider calling a professional. Most filter-related problems are easy fixes, though.
