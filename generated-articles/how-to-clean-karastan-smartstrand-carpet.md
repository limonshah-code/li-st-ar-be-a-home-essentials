### Understanding Your Karastan SmartStrand Carpet's Unique Qualities

Your Karastan SmartStrand carpet is not just any floor covering. It features a unique fiber called Triexta. This fiber resists stains naturally, unlike other carpets that need chemical treatments.

It also protects your family from strong cleaning agents. Knowing your carpet's material helps you pick the best cleaning method.
