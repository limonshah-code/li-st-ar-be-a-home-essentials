We will explore various types of ovens and the best places to purchase them. You will learn about online stores, specialty shops, and local options. We also cover important factors to consider before you buy.

*   **Home Improvement Stores:** Good for accessible, entry-level options.

Specialty outdoor cooking stores and specific brand websites also sell them. Local hardware and department stores may carry a smaller selection. Each option provides different benefits, from wide variety to expert support.

### Understanding Different Types of Outdoor Pizza Ovens

Before you buy, it helps to know about the various types of outdoor pizza ovens. Each type offers different features and benefits. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right oven for your needs. This knowledge guides your purchase decision.

One common type is the **wood-fired pizza oven**. These ovens use wood as fuel. They create a distinct smoky flavor for your pizza. Many people love the traditional taste wood smoke provides. Wood-fired ovens often take longer to heat up. However, they reach very high temperatures, perfect for crisp crusts. Some models are large and permanent structures. Other wood-fired ovens are portable.

Another popular choice is the **gas-powered pizza oven**. These ovens use propane or natural gas. They offer convenience and quick heat-up times. Gas ovens provide consistent temperature control. This makes them easy to use for beginners. They are often smaller and more portable than wood-fired models. Gas ovens do not give the same smoky flavor as wood. They still cook delicious pizzas quickly.

**Multi-fuel pizza ovens** combine features of wood and gas ovens. These ovens give you flexibility. You can choose wood for flavor or gas for convenience. This hybrid design means you get the best of both worlds. Multi-fuel ovens are often a good investment for those wanting options. They allow you to experiment with different cooking styles.

Then there are **electric pizza ovens**. These are less common for outdoor use, but some models exist. Electric ovens plug into an outlet. They are very easy to use and require no special fuel. They generally do not reach the extremely high temperatures of wood or gas ovens. This means cooking times may be longer. Electric models are often compact.

Finally, **portable pizza ovens** are a category within these types. Many gas and some smaller wood-fired ovens are portable. They are lightweight and easy to move. You can take them camping, to tailgates, or to a friend's house. Portability is a key feature for people with limited space. It is also good for those who want to cook pizza in different locations. The cost of an outdoor pizza oven can vary greatly depending on its type and features. [How much does an Ooni pizza oven cost](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-does-an-ooni-pizza-oven-cost) is a common question, as Ooni makes several popular portable models across different fuel types. Knowing the various types helps you match an oven to your lifestyle.

You can ask specific questions and get tailored recommendations.

These sources are good if you want to invest in a specific brand. They also work if you need expert guidance. They often provide excellent after-sales support.

### Home Improvement Stores and Department Stores

Home improvement stores and large department stores also sell outdoor pizza ovens. These options are convenient for many buyers. You can often see the products in person. This helps you judge size and build quality.

**Home Depot** is a major player in this category. They have physical stores across the country. Many locations stock popular outdoor pizza oven models. You can walk in and see ovens like the Cuisinart Wood Pellet Grill & Smoker with Pizza Oven Kit. They also carry larger units, sometimes on display. Checking inventory online before visiting is a good idea. Home Depot staff can help you load larger items.

**Lowe's** offers a similar in-store experience. Their outdoor living sections often feature various grills and cooking appliances. You might find portable gas ovens or smaller wood-fired models. Lowe's stores allow you to compare dimensions and materials. Their customer service desk can assist with special orders. This is helpful if the specific model you want is not in stock. Sometimes, building an outdoor pizza oven with bricks is an option, and stores like Lowe's or Home Depot will have all the materials you would need for such a project. This contrasts with buying a pre-made oven. [How to build an outdoor pizza oven with bricks](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-build-an-outdoor-pizza-oven-with-bricks) provides details on this DIY approach.

**Big box department stores** like Target or Best Buy sometimes carry entry-level outdoor pizza ovens. Their selection is usually more limited. They often focus on smaller, more affordable portable models. These stores might be a good option if you need a basic oven for occasional use. They are easily accessible in many towns and cities. Their seasonal outdoor living sections are the best places to check.

The main advantage of buying from these stores is the ability to see the product. You can assess the build quality firsthand. You can also take the oven home immediately if it is in stock. This avoids shipping delays. They also offer competitive pricing, especially during sales events. However, the range of models might not be as vast as online specialty retailers. Staff expertise might also vary greatly from that of a dedicated pizza oven specialist. Always verify the store's stock online before making a trip.

### Considering Used and Refurbished Options

Buying a used or refurbished outdoor pizza oven can save you money. It is a good option for budget-conscious buyers. This route requires careful inspection. You can find quality ovens if you know where to look.

**Online marketplaces** are popular places for used items. **Facebook Marketplace** is a common site. People list their used pizza ovens there. You can search locally and arrange pickup. Always inspect the oven thoroughly before buying. Look for rust, cracks, or missing parts. Ask the seller questions about its history and usage. I have seen many great deals on high-quality items here. It is a good place to find a bargain.

**Craigslist** is another option for local listings. Similar to Facebook Marketplace, it involves direct seller-buyer interaction. Be cautious and meet in a safe, public place for transactions. Inspect the oven carefully for any damage. Ensure all components are present. Some sellers may offer a demonstration of the oven working. This is a bonus.

**eBay** offers both local pickup and shipping for used items. You can find a wider geographical range of ovens here. Look for sellers with good ratings and clear photos. Read the item description carefully. eBay's buyer protection can offer some peace of mind. However, shipping a large pizza oven can be expensive. Factor this into your budget.

**Refurbished units** are sometimes available directly from manufacturers or certified resellers. These ovens have been returned, repaired, and tested. They come with a warranty, though it might be shorter than a new product warranty. Refurbished ovens often look like new. They perform like new but cost less. Check brand websites or large electronics retailers for refurbished programs.

**Local yard sales and estate sales** can also hide outdoor pizza oven gems. These are less predictable sources. However, you might find a very good deal. You need to be patient and check listings regularly. Attending these sales early gives you the best chance.

When considering a used oven, assess its condition. Make sure it is safe to operate. Check for proper ventilation and fuel lines. Even with a used oven, you can cook various dishes. For example, [can you cook frozen pizza in an outdoor pizza oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-cook-frozen-pizza-in-outdoor-pizza-oven)? Yes, you absolutely can, making it versatile regardless of its origin. Buying used helps reduce waste. It also gives you access to models you might not afford new.

### Factors to Consider Before You Buy

Choosing an outdoor pizza oven involves several important decisions. Thinking about these factors before you buy helps you make the right choice. It ensures you get an oven that fits your lifestyle.

**Fuel Type** is a primary consideration. Do you prefer the traditional flavor of **wood-fired** pizza? Wood ovens require more effort to heat and manage. Do you value the convenience and speed of **gas**? Gas ovens are easy to use and offer consistent temperatures. Some ovens are **multi-fuel**, giving you both options. Electric ovens are simpler but less powerful for high-heat cooking. Your choice impacts cooking experience and pizza flavor.

**Size and Portability** matter for your space. Do you have a large backyard or a small patio? Permanent, built-in ovens need dedicated space. Portable ovens are great for small areas or for taking on trips. Consider where you will store the oven when not in use. Some ovens are countertop models, while others need a standalone table. You might need to consider [what can I put my Ooni pizza oven on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-can-i-put-my-ooni-pizza-oven-on) or [how to make a pizza oven table](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-a-pizza-oven-table) if you purchase a smaller, more portable model that requires a sturdy surface.

**Cooking Capacity** refers to how many pizzas you can cook at once. Smaller ovens usually cook one pizza at a time. Larger ovens can handle two or more. If you plan to host big gatherings, a larger oven is better. For a small family or personal use, a single-pizza oven works well. Consider your typical group size.

**Heat-Up Time** is important for quick meals. Gas ovens heat up much faster than wood-fired ovens. Some ovens can reach cooking temperature in 15-20 minutes. Others may take 45-60 minutes or longer. If you want pizza on demand, faster heat-up is a plus.

**Price and Budget** are always key. Outdoor pizza ovens range from a few hundred dollars to several thousands. Set a budget before you start shopping. Remember to factor in accessories like pizza peels, infrared thermometers, and covers. Fuel costs should also be part of your budget.

**Material and Durability** affect the oven's lifespan. Stainless steel is common and durable. Ceramic or refractory cement are good for heat retention. Consider how well the oven will withstand outdoor elements. A cover can protect your investment.

**Maintenance and Cleaning** vary by oven type. Gas ovens are generally easier to clean. Wood-fired ovens produce ash. Consider the effort you are willing to put into upkeep.

Thinking through these points helps narrow down your choices. It leads you to an oven you will use and enjoy for years.

### Setting Up and Maintaining Your New Pizza Oven

After buying your outdoor pizza oven, proper setup and maintenance ensure its longevity and performance. Getting started correctly makes your pizza-making experience enjoyable. A little care goes a long way.

First, **choose a safe location** for your oven. The area should be flat and stable. Place the oven on a non-combustible surface. Keep it away from flammable materials like wooden fences or overhanging branches. Ensure good ventilation. Never use an outdoor pizza oven indoors. [Can you use an outdoor pizza oven inside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-an-outdoor-pizza-oven-inside)? No, outdoor pizza ovens produce carbon monoxide and high heat. Using them indoors is dangerous and can be lethal. Always operate them in a well-ventilated outdoor space.

**Assemble the oven** according to the manufacturer's instructions. This step is crucial for safe operation. Take your time and follow each step carefully. Ensure all connections are secure, especially for gas models. A stable base is vital for both safety and cooking efficiency. Some ovens require a dedicated table.

**Seasoning the oven** is often necessary, especially for wood-fired models. This involves a slow, gradual heat-up process. It helps to cure the oven materials. It also removes any manufacturing residues. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the initial burn. This prepares the oven for high-temperature cooking.

**Fuel management** is key. For gas ovens, ensure your propane tank is full and connected properly. Check for leaks before use. For wood-fired ovens, use dry, seasoned hardwood. Avoid softwoods or treated wood. These can produce too much smoke or harmful chemicals. Learn to manage your fire to maintain consistent temperatures.

**Preheating** is essential for great pizza. Most outdoor pizza ovens need to reach very high temperatures. This ensures a crispy crust and perfectly cooked toppings. Allow enough time for the oven and the pizza stone or deck to heat thoroughly. An infrared thermometer helps measure the cooking surface temperature accurately.

**Cleaning after use** helps maintain your oven. For wood-fired ovens, remove ash once cooled. Brush crumbs from the cooking surface. For gas ovens, wipe down the exterior. Clean the cooking stone with a brush once cooled. Avoid soap on pizza stones as it can soak in. Regularly check gas lines for wear. Keep the oven covered when not in use. This protects it from weather elements. [Can you use an outdoor pizza oven in winter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-an-outdoor-pizza-oven-in-winter)? Many models can be used in winter, but they may take longer to heat up and require proper care to prevent damage from moisture or extreme cold.

Proper setup and regular maintenance extend your oven's life. They also ensure every pizza you make is delicious.
