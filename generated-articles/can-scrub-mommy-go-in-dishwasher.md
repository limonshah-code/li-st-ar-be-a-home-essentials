### Can Scrub Mommy Go In Dishwasher?

Yes, you can put your Scrub Mommy in the dishwasher.

### Understanding Scrub Mommy's Unique Design

The Scrub Mommy is not just any ordinary sponge. It features a clever dual-sided design that makes it stand out. One side uses FlexTexture material, and the other side uses ResoFoam. These materials work together to offer a complete cleaning experience. I find this design makes cleaning much easier.

FlexTexture is the firm, scrubbing side. This material changes its texture based on water temperature. In cold water, FlexTexture becomes firm and rigid. This firm texture is excellent for scrubbing away tough, stuck-on grime. It helps you remove stubborn food from dishes or clean hardened spills on surfaces. When you put it in warm water, FlexTexture softens. This softer state is ideal for lighter cleaning tasks. It lets you wipe surfaces gently without scratching. This ability to change firmness makes it incredibly versatile.

ResoFoam is the soft, absorbent side. This material is super absorbent, which means it holds a lot of soap and water. It creates rich suds, helping you clean more effectively with less effort. The soft texture is perfect for wiping down surfaces and drying. It does not scratch delicate items. I often use this side to wipe my kitchen counters clean after scrubbing. The combination of these two materials provides excellent cleaning power. They allow Scrub Mommy to tackle various messes efficiently.

The unique properties of FlexTexture and ResoFoam make the Scrub Mommy special. These materials are durable and resist odors. They are also non-scratch, so you can use them on many different surfaces. For example, I use my Scrub Mommy on my stainless steel sink and my delicate glass cooktop. The design ensures that it performs well in different cleaning scenarios. Understanding these materials helps us know how to care for the sponge. Knowing how it works helps us clean it correctly.

Its dual-sided nature means you get two tools in one. This saves space and adds convenience. The FlexTexture side scrubs, while the ResoFoam side wipes and absorbs. It works well on different kitchen surfaces, from pots and pans to countertops. I have personally used it to clean various items, and it always performs reliably. This design also helps with its care. The materials can withstand various cleaning methods, including machine washing.

The materials are designed to last. They resist common issues like odor buildup and staining. Many traditional sponges start to smell bad quickly. Scrub Mommy's material composition helps it stay fresh for longer. This makes it a more hygienic option for your home. This unique structure directly affects how we can clean it safely.

### Putting Scrub Mommy in the Dishwasher: A Safe Method

Cleaning your Scrub Mommy in the dishwasher is one of the easiest ways to sanitize it. The dishwasher uses high heat and detergent to kill germs. This method saves you time and effort. I find it very convenient to toss my Scrub Mommy in with a regular load of dishes.

First, make sure your Scrub Mommy is free from any large food particles. Rinse it under running water to remove loose debris. This step prevents food bits from getting stuck in your dishwasher filter. It also ensures a more effective cleaning cycle. A quick rinse is all it takes.

Next, place your Scrub Mommy on the top rack of the dishwasher. The top rack is important because it is farther away from the heating element at the bottom. Direct exposure to the heating element can damage certain plastics and materials. The FlexTexture and ResoFoam materials of Scrub Mommy are heat-resistant, but placing it on the top rack gives extra protection. It ensures even water and detergent distribution.

Choose a cycle that uses high heat, such as a "sanitize" or "heavy duty" cycle. These cycles reach higher temperatures, which are essential for killing bacteria and germs. The high heat helps loosen any grease or grime stuck in the sponge. It also helps eliminate odors that can build up over time. If your dishwasher has a heated dry option, you can use it. This helps dry the sponge completely, further preventing mold or mildew growth. However, if you are concerned about too much heat, you can choose not to use the heated dry. Just let the Scrub Mommy air dry after the cycle finishes.

Using your dishwasher to clean your Scrub Mommy offers several benefits. It provides thorough sanitation, killing bacteria that can accumulate in sponges. It also helps remove stubborn odors, leaving your Scrub Mommy smelling fresh. This method is hands-off, freeing you up to do other tasks. I often clean my Scrub Mommy this way when I clean my [how to scrub cooktops](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-scrub-cooktops) or my [how to scrub ceramic pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-scrub-ceramic-pan). It just makes sense to clean the tool at the same time.

Some people worry about the durability of their Scrub Mommy in the dishwasher. Rest assured, the materials are designed to withstand regular washing. The FlexTexture side can become very soft during a hot wash, but it will regain its firmness once it cools down. The ResoFoam side will also dry completely. This cleaning method is safe and effective for the long-term care of your sponge. Just remember, proper placement is key to avoiding any potential issues. Many household items, including specific types of cookware, are also dishwasher safe.

### Beyond the Dishwasher: Other Ways to Clean Your Scrub Mommy

While the dishwasher is a convenient option, you have other effective ways to clean and sanitize your Scrub Mommy. These methods are great if you do not have a dishwasher or prefer alternative cleaning techniques. I use these methods often, especially if I need a quick clean between dishwasher cycles.

#### Microwave Sanitization

Microwaving is a popular and fast way to sanitize sponges. It uses heat to kill bacteria quickly. This method is very effective against germs. It can make your sponge smell fresh again.

To clean your Scrub Mommy in the microwave, first, wet it completely. It must be saturated with water; do not microwave a dry sponge. A dry sponge can catch fire or melt in the microwave. Place the wet Scrub Mommy on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave it on high for about 60 seconds. Some people go for 90 seconds, but 60 seconds is usually enough. Be very careful when removing the sponge and plate. They will be extremely hot. Let the sponge cool down before you touch it. This method kills up to 99% of bacteria.

#### Boiling Water Method

Boiling water is another simple yet powerful way to sanitize your Scrub Mommy. It is a traditional method that works well. The high temperature of boiling water effectively kills bacteria and breaks down grease. This method is great for a deep clean.

Fill a pot with water and bring it to a rolling boil. Once the water is boiling, carefully place your Scrub Mommy into the pot using tongs. Make sure the sponge is fully submerged. Let it boil for about 2 to 5 minutes. The longer time helps with heavy grime. After boiling, carefully remove the sponge with tongs. Place it on a clean surface to cool and air dry. This method is very effective at sanitizing and removing odors.

#### Vinegar or Bleach Soak

Soaking your Scrub Mommy in a cleaning solution is also an option. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant and deodorizer. Bleach is a strong disinfectant. You must use caution with bleach and dilute it properly.

For a vinegar soak, mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a bowl. Submerge your Scrub Mommy in the solution for 5 to 10 minutes. After soaking, rinse the sponge thoroughly under clean running water. Squeeze out all the excess liquid. Let it air dry. This method is gentle on the sponge but effective for odors and some bacteria.

For a bleach soak, create a very diluted bleach solution. Mix about 1/4 cup of bleach with one gallon of water. Submerge your Scrub Mommy in this solution for about 5 minutes. Do not soak it for too long, as bleach can degrade materials over time. Always wear gloves when handling bleach. After soaking, rinse the sponge extensively under clean water to remove all bleach residue. Squeeze it dry. This method is highly effective for sanitization but use it less frequently.

These alternative cleaning methods offer flexibility. They help ensure your Scrub Mommy stays clean and hygienic. I find that rotating between methods keeps my sponges in good shape. For example, I might microwave it for a quick daily refresh. Then I put it in the dishwasher once a week for a deeper clean. These practices are similar to how you would clean other popular sponges. Knowing [how to clean scrub daddy](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-scrub-daddy) can provide additional context, as the materials share similar properties.

### How Often Should You Clean Your Scrub Mommy?

The frequency of cleaning your Scrub Mommy depends largely on how often you use it and what you use it for. A general rule is to clean it regularly to prevent bacteria buildup and odors. I find that daily use requires more frequent cleaning.

If you use your Scrub Mommy daily for washing dishes or wiping kitchen surfaces, I recommend cleaning it every day or every other day. This daily cleaning helps remove food particles and detergent residue. It stops bacteria from multiplying quickly. A quick rinse and squeeze after each use are essential. This helps remove loose debris. For a deeper clean, consider microwaving it daily. Or, you can place it in the dishwasher every few days.

Signs that your Scrub Mommy needs cleaning include an unpleasant odor. A clean sponge should not smell bad. If you notice a sour or mildewy smell, it is a clear sign that bacteria are present. Another sign is discoloration or visible grime. If the sponge looks dirty or stained even after a rinse, it needs a thorough clean. It is important to clean it before these signs become too obvious. This proactive approach helps maintain hygiene.

The importance of regular cleaning cannot be overstated. Sponges can harbor a lot of bacteria because they are often wet and collect food particles. These bacteria can then spread to your dishes and surfaces. Regular cleaning reduces this risk. It helps keep your kitchen truly clean. It also impacts the sponge's lifespan. A well-maintained sponge lasts longer. It performs better when it is clean.

Think about how often you clean other items in your kitchen. You clean your countertops daily. You clean your dishes after every meal. Your sponge, which touches all these things, also needs regular attention. Some experts suggest cleaning your sponge after every few uses for optimal hygiene. For a family that cooks a lot, this could mean daily cleaning. For someone who uses it less often, every two to three days might be enough.

Consider the general cleanliness of your dishwasher itself. A clean dishwasher helps ensure the items inside it get truly clean. Understanding [how often should you clean dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-dishwasher) can give you a good perspective on overall kitchen cleaning hygiene. When your cleaning tools are clean, your entire home cleaning routine becomes more effective. It is all part of a larger system.

The type of cleaning tasks also matters. If you use your Scrub Mommy to clean up raw meat juices or very greasy messes, it needs immediate and thorough sanitization. This might involve a dishwasher cycle or boiling. For light wiping tasks, a good rinse and daily microwave might suffice. Always err on the side of more frequent cleaning. It is better to have a clean, sanitary tool than to risk spreading germs.

### Extending the Lifespan of Your Scrub Mommy

You can maximize your Scrub Mommy's usefulness by taking proper care of it. Extending its lifespan not only saves you money but also ensures you always have an effective cleaning tool on hand. I have found that a few simple habits make a big difference.

One of the most important steps is proper storage. After each use and cleaning, allow your Scrub Mommy to air dry completely. Do not leave it sitting in standing water. Water encourages bacterial growth and can lead to odors. I always stand mine upright or place it on a soap dish with good drainage. Some people use a suction cup holder that lets the sponge air out fully. Air circulation is key to preventing mildew and prolonging the sponge's freshness. This simple act alone can greatly increase its life.

Avoid using harsh chemicals that are not designed for sponges. While a diluted bleach solution is okay for occasional sanitization, strong, undiluted chemicals can break down the FlexTexture and ResoFoam materials over time. Stick to water, dish soap, or the sanitizing methods discussed earlier. For example, do not use industrial cleaners or very abrasive chemicals on your Scrub Mommy. This helps preserve its integrity and unique properties.

Know when to replace your Scrub Mommy. Even with the best care, sponges do not last forever. If your Scrub Mommy starts to show significant wear and tear, it might be time for a new one. Signs include permanent discoloration, tearing, or if it loses its ability to firm up in cold water. If it retains a bad odor even after cleaning, that is another strong indicator. Usually, a Scrub Mommy can last several weeks to a few months, depending on usage. Replacing it when it is past its prime ensures you always have an effective and hygienic tool.

Consider having more than one Scrub Mommy. Rotating between two or three sponges can extend the life of each. While one is drying or in the dishwasher, you can use another. This also gives each sponge more time to air out completely between uses. I often have one for dishes and another for general kitchen wiping. This rotation strategy means no single sponge gets overused. It also ensures I always have a fresh one ready.

Proper care is not just about cleaning. It is also about gentle use. While Scrub Mommy is durable, avoid using excessive force or sharp objects that could tear the sponge. For example, do not use it to scrape off heavy, burnt-on food with sharp edges. Choose the right side for the right task. Use the soft ResoFoam side for delicate surfaces. Use the firm FlexTexture side for tougher scrubbing. This mindful use prevents premature damage.

These practices ensure your Scrub Mommy remains effective. They help it stay hygienic for longer. Caring for your cleaning tools is just as important as cleaning your home. It creates a more efficient and pleasant cleaning experience. These tips are straightforward and easy to incorporate into your daily routine.

### Addressing Common Concerns About Scrub Mommy Care

Many people have specific questions about caring for their Scrub Mommy. These concerns often relate to odors, discoloration, or potential damage. I want to address some of these common issues directly. Understanding these points helps you care for your sponge better.

One frequent concern is odor issues. Despite its odor-resistant properties, any sponge can develop a smell if not properly cared for. This usually happens when bacteria grow due to dampness or food particles. To prevent odors, always rinse your Scrub Mommy thoroughly after each use. Squeeze out excess water. Then, allow it to air dry completely. Do not leave it sitting in a damp sink or a closed container. If an odor does develop, a good dishwasher cycle or microwave sanitization usually solves the problem. These methods kill the bacteria causing the smell.

Discoloration is another common observation. Over time, your Scrub Mommy might change color. This is often due to absorbing pigments from food, like tomato sauce or turmeric. It can also happen from cleaning certain surfaces. This discoloration usually does not affect the sponge's cleaning performance. It is mostly a cosmetic issue. As long as the sponge is clean and odor-free, a little staining is normal. If the discoloration bothers you, a stronger cleaning method like a bleach soak (diluted) might help lighten it. However, focus more on hygiene than perfect color.

Some users worry about damage from improper cleaning methods. For instance, microwaving a dry sponge can cause it to melt or catch fire. Always ensure your Scrub Mommy is completely saturated with water before microwaving. Similarly, using harsh, undiluted chemicals can degrade the sponge's materials. Always follow dilution instructions for bleach or other cleaners. When using the dishwasher, placing it on the top rack is important. This prevents direct contact with the heating element, which could cause melting. Following recommended cleaning practices prevents these issues.

Comparison to other types of sponges often comes up. Traditional cellulose sponges are very absorbent but tend to hold onto bacteria and odors more easily. They also break down faster. Synthetic sponges might be more durable but often lack the scrubbing power of FlexTexture. Scrub Mommy's unique blend of materials provides a balance. It offers good scrubbing, absorbency, and better odor resistance. Its durability with proper care often surpasses that of cheaper, single-material sponges. It is designed to withstand multiple cleaning methods, including machine washing, unlike many other sponges.

Some people wonder if extreme hot water from the tap might damage it. While very hot water from the tap is safe for use with Scrub Mommy, it is not as effective for sanitization as a dishwasher or microwave. Tap water rarely reaches temperatures high enough to kill all bacteria. For effective sanitization, you need sustained high heat. That is why dishwashers, microwaves, or boiling are recommended for deep cleaning.

Finally, ensuring your dishwasher itself is clean can contribute to your Scrub Mommy's overall cleanliness. If your dishwasher has grime or residue, it can transfer to the items inside. Knowing [what can you use to clean a dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-can-you-use-to-clean-a-dishwasher) can help you maintain your appliance. A clean dishwasher means your Scrub Mommy gets a better clean too. This comprehensive approach ensures all your cleaning tools are working at their best.
