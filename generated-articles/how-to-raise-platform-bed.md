### How To Raise Platform Bed

You can raise a platform bed using various methods. Bed risers offer a simple solution, lifting the entire frame. Replacing existing legs with taller ones or adding casters provides a more integrated look. For significant height changes, building a custom base underneath offers strong support and can include storage.

## Why Raise Your Platform Bed? Practical Benefits and Design Impact

I often hear people ask why someone would want to raise their bed. There are several excellent reasons. A common one is to gain extra storage space. Raising the bed allows more room underneath for bins, boxes, or even dedicated drawers. This is especially useful in smaller bedrooms or apartments.

Another reason relates to comfort and accessibility. For some, a higher bed makes it easier to get in and out, reducing strain on knees and backs. This is often the case for taller individuals or those with mobility considerations. It truly makes a difference in daily comfort.

Finally, raising your platform bed can significantly impact your room's design. A higher bed can make a room feel grander and more luxurious. It changes the visual scale, sometimes making the ceiling feel higher. This simple adjustment can refresh your bedroom's entire aesthetic. You might also find it easier to [clean under bed](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-under-bed) once the bed is elevated.

## Essential Tools and Safety First for Bed Elevation

Before you start any bed-raising project, proper preparation is key. I always make sure I have the right tools ready. You will likely need a tape measure, a level, a pencil for marking, and possibly a drill or wrench depending on your chosen method. Having these tools beforehand saves time and frustration during the process.

Safety should always be your top priority. Before lifting your bed, remove the mattress and any bedding. This reduces weight and makes the frame easier to handle. Have a helper if possible, especially for larger beds. Lifting heavy objects alone can cause injury.

Inspect your bed frame for any existing damage. If your platform bed is wobbly or shows signs of wear, address these issues first. A stable base is crucial before adding height.

Ensuring the bed's structural integrity prevents future problems once elevated.

## Method 1: Using Bed Risers for Quick Height Adjustment

Bed risers are perhaps the simplest way to raise your platform bed. These are small, sturdy blocks that fit under each bed leg. They come in various materials, like plastic, wood, or metal, and offer different height increments. You can find them in heights from 2 to 12 inches.

Installing bed risers is straightforward. First, remove your mattress and clear the area around your bed. Then, with a helper, carefully lift one corner of the bed frame and slide a riser under its leg. Repeat this process for each leg. Make sure all risers are level and securely in place before placing your mattress back on the frame.

While convenient, it is important to consider stability. Choose risers with wide bases to prevent tipping. Ensure the leg fits snugly into the riser's top cup. Some platform beds have a continuous base rather than individual legs. For these, you might need a different solution or specialized, longer risers designed for larger surfaces.

## Method 2: Replacing Legs or Adding Casters for Integrated Height

Another effective way to raise your platform bed is by replacing its existing legs. Many platform beds have legs that screw directly into the frame. You can easily unscrew these and replace them with taller legs of the same thread size. This method offers a more integrated look, as the new height comes directly from the bed's design.

When choosing new legs, ensure they are strong enough to support your bed's weight. Measure the existing leg's thread diameter and length to buy compatible replacements. You can find a variety of styles and materials online or at hardware stores. This approach gives you greater control over the final aesthetic of your elevated bed.

Adding casters, or wheels, is another option, especially if you want your bed to be movable. Casters often have a post that inserts into a socket or a plate that screws onto the frame. This not only raises the bed but also allows easy relocation for cleaning or rearranging your room. Just remember to use locking casters to prevent unwanted movement while you sleep.

## Method 3: Building a Custom Base for Significant Elevation

If you want to significantly raise your platform bed or need substantial under-bed storage, building a custom base is an excellent solution. This method provides the most stability and customization options. You can design a base with built-in drawers or open shelving, maximizing every inch of newfound space. This is similar to designing a [twin platform bed with storage underneath](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-build-a-twin-platform-bed-with-storage-underneath), just on a larger scale.

Materials for a custom base can range from sturdy lumber to plywood and even metal framing. The design should match the footprint of your existing platform bed for even weight distribution. You will need basic carpentry skills and tools like saws, drills, and fasteners. I recommend drawing out your design first, including exact measurements.

Constructing a custom base involves building a sturdy box or frame that your platform bed will rest on. Reinforce all joints and ensure the structure is perfectly level. This method gives you ultimate control over height and functionality. It turns your simple platform bed into a functional storage solution.

## Considerations Before Raising Your Bed: Stability and Aesthetics

Before you finalize your decision to raise your platform bed, think about a few key elements. First, consider the stability of your mattress. When a bed is higher, the mattress might feel less secure. Sometimes, adding a non-slip pad between the mattress and the platform helps prevent sliding. This is similar to keeping your mattress from sliding on any bed frame. For more tips on this, you might find our guide on [how to keep mattress from sliding off platform bed](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-mattress-from-sliding-off-platform-bed) useful.

Next, consider your headboard. If you have an existing headboard, raising the bed might make it appear too short or disproportionate. You may need to adjust its mounting height or consider a taller headboard. If you are attaching a headboard, ensure it is secure at the new height. Our article on [how to attach a headboard to a platform bed](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-attach-a-headboard-to-a-platform-bed) can offer further guidance.

Finally, visualize the new aesthetic. A higher bed changes the room's balance. Ensure it still fits the overall design of your bedroom. Consider how it impacts other furniture pieces, like nightstands or dressers. Sometimes, a small change in height can have a big impact on the room's feel.

## Maintaining Stability and Preventing Issues After Elevation

After raising your platform bed, ongoing stability is vital. Regularly check all connections and components. If you used bed risers, make sure they remain firmly seated under each leg. Over time, slight shifts can occur, which may lead to wobbling. Tighten any screws or bolts on your bed frame periodically. This ensures the frame stays rigid at its new height.

Be mindful of weight distribution. Avoid placing excessive weight unevenly on the bed. For example, do not sit on one side of the bed more often if it causes strain on specific risers or legs. Distribute your weight as evenly as possible. This helps maintain the bed's integrity and prevents undue stress on the elevated components.

Consider using rubber pads or felt protectors under the new legs or risers. These can prevent scratches on your floor and also add a layer of grip. A slightly softer contact point can absorb minor vibrations and reduce creaking noises. A little maintenance goes a long way in enjoying your elevated bed for years.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it safe to raise a platform bed?

Yes, raising a platform bed can be safe if done correctly. You must use strong, appropriate materials and ensure even weight distribution. Always check for stability after the process. Never exceed the weight capacity of risers or new legs. Prioritize a stable, level setup to prevent accidents.

### How much can I raise my bed?

The amount you can raise your bed depends on the method and your bed's design. Bed risers typically add 2-12 inches. Custom bases can add significantly more height, sometimes a foot or more. Always ensure the new height is comfortable and stable for you. Consider ceiling height clearance.

### Will raising my bed void its warranty?

Modifying your bed frame, like adding risers or custom legs, might void its warranty. Most manufacturers specify that modifications or improper use can nullify coverage. Check your bed frame's warranty terms before making significant changes. If concerned, contact the manufacturer for clarification.

### What types of bed risers are best?

The best bed risers are sturdy and made from durable materials like solid wood, heavy-duty plastic, or metal. Look for risers with wide bases for stability and a deep cup to securely hold the bed leg. Ensure they match your bed's leg size and shape. Choose risers with non-slip pads for added safety.

### Can I raise my bed for more storage?

Yes, raising your bed is a common and effective way to gain more storage space. The increased clearance underneath allows for taller storage bins, drawers, or even small furniture pieces. This is an excellent solution for decluttering and maximizing space, especially in smaller bedrooms.

### What about my headboard after raising?

When you raise your bed, your headboard's height relative to the mattress changes. It might appear too low. You may need to adjust the headboard's mounting brackets if it is wall-mounted or attach it directly to the elevated bed frame. Some taller headboards might not require adjustment.
