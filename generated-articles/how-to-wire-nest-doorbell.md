### Understanding Your Nest Doorbell Model and Requirements

Before you start, it is important to know which Nest Doorbell model you own. Google offers two main types: the Nest Doorbell (wired) and the Nest Doorbell (battery). Both have distinct wiring considerations. The wired model requires a constant power supply from your existing doorbell circuit. It uses your traditional chime.

The battery model runs on its internal battery. However, you can wire it for continuous power and to ring your existing chime. This eliminates the need for frequent battery recharges. Knowing your model helps determine the exact steps and accessories you will need.

Every Nest Doorbell needs a specific power range to operate correctly. The Nest Doorbell (wired) typically requires 16-24 V AC and 10 VA (or higher). The Nest Doorbell (battery) requires 8-24 V AC for continuous power. You must ensure your existing doorbell transformer meets these specifications. An incompatible transformer can cause issues or even damage your new doorbell.

You should locate your current doorbell chime and transformer. The chime is usually in a hallway, kitchen, or living area. The transformer might be hidden in a utility closet, basement, or near your furnace. It is a small box often attached to a junction box. Confirming its voltage output is a crucial first step. You can often find the voltage printed directly on the transformer itself. Consider if your [Nest Doorbell battery can be wired](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-nest-doorbell-battery-be-wired) if you own that model.

### Essential Tools and Safety Precautions Before You Wire

Safety must always come first when working with electricity. Before touching any wires, turn off power to your doorbell circuit at the circuit breaker. Locate your home's electrical panel and flip the switch corresponding to your doorbell. If you are unsure which breaker it is, turn off the main breaker for your home. Use a non-contact voltage tester to confirm that the power is off at the doorbell wires. This simple step prevents electrical shock.

Gather all your necessary tools before beginning the installation. A Philips head screwdriver and a flathead screwdriver are essential for removing your old doorbell and mounting the new one. You will also need wire strippers if your existing wires are damaged or too short. A drill with appropriate bits may be necessary to mount the new base plate. If you do not have a pre-existing doorbell, you will need to run new low-voltage wires.

A multimeter is highly recommended to check your transformer's voltage. This ensures it meets your Nest Doorbell's requirements. Electrical tape can secure connections or insulate exposed wires. Small wire nuts or spade connectors might be included with your Nest Doorbell, but having extras is wise. Gloves and safety glasses can provide additional protection during the installation process. Prepare your workspace and ensure good lighting.

### Locating Your Doorbell Chime and Transformer

Finding your doorbell chime is usually straightforward. It is the box that makes the "ding-dong" sound when someone presses your current doorbell button. Common locations include a hallway, living room wall, or even inside a coat closet. Once you locate the chime, open its cover. You will see two wires connected to it, typically marked "Front" and "Trans." These wires lead to your doorbell button and the transformer, respectively.

The transformer is often harder to find. It converts your home's standard voltage to the low voltage required by your doorbell system. Common places for a transformer include inside a utility closet, in your basement, near your furnace, or in the garage. Look for a small, cube-shaped device directly wired into a junction box. It often has two wires coming out of it. The voltage output (e.g., 16V, 24V) is usually printed on its casing.

Once you find the transformer, use your multimeter to check its voltage. Set the multimeter to AC voltage. Touch one probe to each screw terminal on the transformer where the wires connect. The reading should fall within the range required by your Nest Doorbell. If your voltage is too low or too high, you might need to upgrade your transformer. Understanding [how to wire a doorbell with a transformer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wire-doorbell-with-transformer) is key to a successful Nest Doorbell setup. This step ensures proper power delivery to your new smart device.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Wire Your Nest Doorbell (Wired Model)

You have turned off the power, gathered your tools, and confirmed your transformer voltage. Now you are ready to wire the Nest Doorbell (wired model). First, remove your old doorbell button from the wall. You will typically find two wires connected to its back. Carefully disconnect these wires, making sure they do not fall back into the wall. Secure them with electrical tape or gently bend them to stay outside the wall opening.

Next, install the Nest Doorbell's mounting plate. This plate screws into your wall where the old doorbell was located. Use the provided screws and wall anchors if needed. Ensure the plate is level. Thread the two wires from your wall through the center opening of the mounting plate.

Now, connect the wires to the back of the Nest Doorbell itself. The Nest Doorbell (wired) has two screw terminals on its back. It does not matter which wire goes to which terminal. Loosen the screws, insert one wire under each screw, and tighten them securely. Ensure no stray wire strands are touching. Gently push any excess wire back into the wall opening.

Carefully snap the Nest Doorbell onto its mounting plate. It should click into place firmly. At your chime box, you will need to install the chime connector. This small device ensures your existing chime rings correctly and provides consistent power to your Nest Doorbell. Follow the instructions that come with your chime connector carefully. Typically, you will disconnect the chime wires, connect them to the chime connector, and then connect the chime connector to the chime terminals. This ensures proper power regulation and chime functionality.

### Wiring the Nest Doorbell (Battery Model) for Continuous Power

The Nest Doorbell (battery) offers flexibility. It can run purely on its internal battery, or you can wire it for continuous power. Wiring the battery model means you rarely need to recharge it. It also allows your existing chime to ring when someone presses the doorbell. This offers the best of both worlds: battery backup and traditional chime functionality.

To wire the battery model, start by ensuring your existing doorbell system meets the voltage requirements (8-24 V AC). Turn off the power at the circuit breaker for safety. Remove your old doorbell button from the wall. You will see two wires. These are the low-voltage wires from your transformer.

Connect these two wires directly to the terminals on the back of the Nest Doorbell (battery). It does not matter which wire goes to which terminal. Secure the wires firmly by tightening the screws. You may need to use the angled wall mount that comes with the battery doorbell to ensure a good fit against your wall. Mount the base plate first, then connect the wires, and finally click the doorbell onto the plate.

The Nest Doorbell (battery) does not require a separate chime connector if you are only using its internal chime or Google Assistant devices for notifications. However, if you want your existing mechanical or digital chime to ring, you will need to install a special accessory. This accessory, often called a "chime connector" or "power connector," helps regulate power and allows the doorbell to communicate with your existing chime. Consult the specific instructions for your battery doorbell and any accessory to ensure proper setup.
