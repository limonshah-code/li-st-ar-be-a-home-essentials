*   **Front-Venting Trim Kits:** This is the best solution. Many trim kits are designed to create a ventilation path. They draw cool air from the bottom front of the kit. They then expel hot air through vents at the top front. This system pushes heat out into the kitchen. This prevents heat buildup inside the cabinet.
*   **Cabinet Back Modification:** Consider removing the back panel of the cabinet. This allows heat to dissipate into the wall cavity or open space behind the cabinet. If you cannot remove the entire back, cut large vent holes. These holes must align with the microwave's vents.
*   **Internal Cabinet Airflow:** Design the cabinet with internal air channels if possible. This might involve creating baffles or internal cutouts. These direct air from lower vents to upper vents, guiding heat out of the enclosure.
*   **Cooling Fan (Advanced):** For extreme cases or very tight spaces, you could install a small, low-noise cooling fan. This fan would draw air into the cabinet and push hot air out. This is a more advanced solution and requires careful electrical planning.
*   **Material Selection:** Use cabinet materials that can withstand heat. Wood is generally fine, but ensure proper insulation or distance from direct heat sources.

Always test your microwave after installation. Run it for several minutes. Check the temperature of the cabinet surfaces. If they feel hot, revisit your ventilation strategy. A well-ventilated built-in microwave operates safely and efficiently.
