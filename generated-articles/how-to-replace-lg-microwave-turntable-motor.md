## Fix Your LG Microwave: Replace the Turntable Motor

Your LG microwave turntable ensures your food cooks evenly. When it stops spinning, cooking becomes less efficient and more frustrating. You do not need to buy a new microwave. Replacing the LG microwave turntable motor is a repair you can handle yourself. This guide shows you each step. We cover safety, tools, and the repair process. By the end, your microwave will spin food properly again. This repair saves you money and extends the life of your appliance.

*   Follow a clear, step-by-step process for motor replacement.
*   Test your repair thoroughly before regular use.

To replace an LG microwave turntable motor, unplug the appliance, remove the bottom cover to access the motor, disconnect the old motor's wires and mounting screws, install the new motor, and then reassemble the microwave. This simple process restores proper turntable function.

## Understanding Your LG Microwave Turntable Motor: Its Purpose

The turntable motor sits at the base of your microwave. Its job is simple: make the glass tray spin. This spinning motion ensures your food cooks evenly. Without it, hot and cold spots appear. This leads to food that is partly hot and partly cold.

The motor connects to a drive shaft. This shaft goes up through the microwave floor. The turntable plate sits on this shaft. When the motor turns, the shaft turns, and the plate turns. It is a vital part for efficient cooking.

A small motor drives this movement. It is often a low-voltage AC motor. Over time, these motors wear out. They might stop working or make strange noises. Knowing its role helps you understand why replacement is necessary.

This motor helps deliver consistent heat. It prevents you from needing to stir or rotate food by hand. This makes microwave cooking convenient. When it fails, you lose this key convenience.

## Signs Your LG Microwave Turntable Motor Needs Replacement

Is your LG microwave acting strange? The turntable motor might be failing. Knowing the signs helps you diagnose the problem. Catching these issues early saves you time. You can fix it before it causes more problems.

First, observe the turntable. If it does not spin, the motor is likely bad. The light might come on, and the microwave might heat, but the plate stays still. This is a clear sign. You might hear the microwave running, but no movement from the tray.

Second, listen for unusual sounds. A failing motor can make grinding or buzzing noises. You might hear a loud hum or a clicking sound. These noises happen when the motor struggles to turn. It might try to spin but cannot. Sometimes, the noise stops when you remove the food, but returns when you put weight on the turntable. Other microwave turntable issues can also cause noise, like those in a [Whirlpool microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-whirlpool-microwave-turntable-making-noise) or a [GE microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-microwave-turntable-make-noise).

Third, check for erratic spinning. The turntable might spin slowly or start and stop. It might even spin in the wrong direction sometimes. This indicates the motor is losing power. It cannot maintain a steady rotation. This leads to uneven cooking results.

These symptoms point to a faulty motor. Replacing it quickly solves these problems. You restore your microwave's ability to cook food properly. Ignoring these signs can lead to more frustration.

## Safety First: Essential Precautions Before You Begin

Working on any appliance requires care. Microwave ovens store high voltage even when unplugged. Taking proper precautions protects you from injury. Never skip these critical steps. Your safety is most important.

First, unplug the microwave from the wall outlet. This step is non-negotiable. Even if the microwave is off, power can still reach components. Always remove the power cord completely. This cuts off all electricity.

Second, understand residual voltage. Microwave capacitors store a powerful electrical charge. This charge can last even after unplugging the unit. Do not touch internal components, especially the capacitor, without proper knowledge. For turntable motor replacement, you usually do not need to interact with the high-voltage capacitor. Still, general caution is good.

Third, wear proper safety gear. Safety glasses protect your eyes from debris. Gloves can protect your hands. Always ensure your workspace is dry. Do not work on a wet floor.

Finally, have a clear work area. Remove clutter from around the microwave. Make sure you have enough light. Follow instructions carefully. Do not rush any step. These steps help ensure a safe repair process.

## Gathering Your Tools and Replacement Parts

Before you start, collect all necessary items. Having everything ready saves time and frustration. A little preparation goes a long way. You want to make this repair smooth and efficient.

First, you need basic hand tools. A Phillips head screwdriver is essential. You will use it for most screws. A flathead screwdriver might also be useful for prying or leverage. You might also need a pair of pliers for wire connections.

Next, get your replacement LG microwave turntable motor. This is the most important part. You must get the correct model number. Check your microwave's model tag, usually inside the door or on the back. Search online using this number. Buying the exact part ensures compatibility. A wrong motor will not fit or work.

You might also need a small dish or container. This helps keep screws organized. Losing small screws can delay your project. A clean cloth for wiping dust is also helpful. These small things make the job easier.

Finally, consider a flashlight. It helps illuminate dark internal areas. Even in a well-lit room, inside the microwave can be dark. Having these items ready allows you to focus on the repair.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Access the Turntable Motor

Accessing the turntable motor in your LG microwave is a key step. The motor is usually found on the underside of the appliance. You need to carefully open the microwave to reach it. This process is similar across many microwave brands. For example, replacing a [Whirlpool microwave turntable motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-whirlpool-microwave-turntable-motor) also involves accessing the bottom panel.

First, unplug the microwave. Place it on a stable, flat surface. A kitchen counter or sturdy table works best. Lay a soft cloth or towel down to prevent scratches. Then, turn the microwave upside down. You need access to its bottom panel.

Next, locate the screws holding the bottom panel. These are usually Phillips head screws. They are often around the edges of the panel. Some models might have screws in the center. Carefully remove all these screws. Place them in your container so they do not get lost.

Once all screws are out, gently lift the bottom panel. It might be slightly stuck due to dust or tight fit. You may need to wiggle it a bit. Do not force it. Lift it slowly until it comes off completely.

With the panel removed, you will see the internal components. Look for the small, round motor. It is usually near the center, directly under where the turntable sits. It will have wires connected to it. This motor is what you need to replace. You might also see other components like a [LG microwave light bulb](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-microwave-light-bulb) wiring, if you were to change that.

## Replacing the Faulty LG Turntable Motor

With the bottom panel removed, you can now replace the motor. This part of the repair is straightforward. Take your time and follow each step carefully. You will have your microwave working again soon.

First, identify the motor. It is a small, usually cylindrical or rectangular component. It will have two wires connected to it. These wires supply power. Also, it will be held in place by screws or clips.

Next, disconnect the old motor's wires. These wires often attach with spade connectors. You can gently pull them off. If they are tight, use pliers. Note which wire goes to which terminal if there is a distinction. Usually, these motors are non-polarized, so wire order does not matter.

Then, remove the screws holding the motor. There are typically two or three screws. Use your Phillips head screwdriver. Once the screws are out, the old motor should lift away easily. Dispose of the old motor properly.

Now, take your new LG microwave turntable motor. Align it with the mounting holes. Insert and tighten the screws. Make sure it is secure. Do not overtighten, as this can strip the plastic housing.

Finally, connect the wires to the new motor. Push the spade connectors firmly onto the motor terminals. Ensure a good, snug fit. A loose connection can cause problems later. The process for replacing the motor is similar to that for a [Frigidaire microwave turntable motor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-frigidaire-microwave-turntable-motor), as the core mechanism is quite standard.

## Testing and Reassembling Your LG Microwave

After installing the new LG microwave turntable motor, it is time to test your work. This ensures everything functions correctly before you fully reassemble the microwave. A quick test prevents needing to open it up again.

First, carefully replace the bottom panel. Do not screw it back in yet. Just put it into place. This covers the internal components. It also allows the microwave to sit properly.

Next, turn the microwave right-side up. Place the glass turntable tray inside. Plug the microwave back into the wall outlet. This restores power to the unit.

Now, perform a test run. Place a cup of water on the turntable. Close the microwave door. Set the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Start the microwave. Watch the turntable. It should spin smoothly and continuously. If it spins, your repair was successful. If it does not spin, unplug it and recheck your connections. Make sure the motor is properly aligned and the wires are secure.

Once you confirm the turntable spins, unplug the microwave again. Turn it back upside down. Secure the bottom panel with all the screws you removed earlier. Tighten them firmly but do not strip them. Reassemble any other parts you detached. Then, turn it upright again. Your LG microwave is now ready for use. This complete process extends the life of your appliance, much like replacing an [LG microwave charcoal filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-microwave-charcoal-filter) improves air quality.
