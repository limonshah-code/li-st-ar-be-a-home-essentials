### Why Your Carpet Padding Needs Replacing

Carpet padding works as a cushion and insulation layer under your carpet. Over time, this padding can wear out. Daily foot traffic, spills, and age break down its structure. When padding loses its resilience, your carpet loses its plush feel. This can make your floors feel hard and uncomfortable. I have seen many homes where old padding made a beautiful carpet look bad.

This extends your carpet's life significantly. Without good padding, your carpet wears out faster, especially in high-traffic areas. This can lead to costly carpet replacements sooner than expected.

#### Signs of Worn Padding

You can easily spot signs of worn carpet padding. Feel your carpet; if it feels lumpy or uneven, the padding is likely failing. Flat spots, especially in pathways, also indicate compression.

Most importantly, new padding protects your carpet, allowing it to last years longer. It supports the carpet's backing and fibers, preventing wear. You get better comfort, better insulation, less noise, and a longer
