**Why is my Miele dishwasher not draining water?**

Your Miele dishwasher is not draining water because of a clog in the filter, drain hose, or air gap. The drain pump might be faulty, or the check valve could be stuck. Sometimes, a problem with the garbage disposal connection stops water from leaving the tub.

## Understanding Miele Dishwasher Drainage: Initial Checks

When your **Miele dishwasher is not draining**, start with simple checks. These steps often fix the problem quickly. Miele dishwashers are quality machines. But even they can have issues. We will begin with the most common reasons for water remaining in the tub. You can often fix these problems yourself.

First, always turn off power to the dishwasher. Unplug it from the wall outlet. This ensures your safety. Standing water is a sign of a blockage. It can also be a pump problem. Look for signs of trouble before you start taking things apart. Check if the dishwasher completed its cycle. Sometimes, it stops mid-cycle due to an error.

The most frequent cause of a Miele dishwasher not draining is a clog. Food particles, grease, and debris build up over time. These block the drainage path. A blocked path stops water from leaving the tub. You need to identify where the blockage is. This helps you choose the right fix. We will go through each possible blockage point. This systematic approach saves you time. It helps avoid unnecessary repairs.

### Checking the Dishwasher Filter System

The filter system is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It catches food bits. If your Miele dishwasher does not drain, this is the first place to check. Food particles like rice, pasta, or small bones can clog the filter. A clogged filter stops water from reaching the drain pump. It causes standing water.

To access the filter, open the dishwasher door. You will see a cylindrical or flat filter assembly. Refer to your Miele manual for exact filter removal steps. Most Miele models have a fine filter and a coarse filter. These work together. They prevent large debris from reaching the pump.

Once you remove the filter parts, clean them thoroughly. Rinse them under running water. Use a soft brush to remove stuck-on food. You can use mild dish soap if needed. Ensure all parts are clear of debris. Rinse them completely. Then put them back in place. Make sure they click into position. A loose filter can also cause issues. Regularly cleaning your Miele filter prevents draining problems.

## Clearing Clogs: Filter and Sump Area Solutions

If your **Miele dishwasher is not draining**, a significant clog in the filter or sump area is a common culprit. The sump is the lowest part of the dishwasher tub. It collects water before the pump sends it out. Over time, debris can build up here. This debris goes past the filter. It can also form sludge. This sludge prevents proper drainage.

Cleaning the filter is the first step. After cleaning the removable filter parts, you need to check the sump area itself. This area sits directly under the filter. Sometimes, tiny bits of food or broken glass can bypass the filter system. They settle in the sump. This buildup restricts water flow to the drain pump. It stops the Miele dishwasher from draining correctly.

To inspect the sump, you might need to remove the lower spray arm. This gives you better access. Use a flashlight to look inside the sump. Check for any visible debris. You might find small bones, toothpicks, or broken pieces of dishware. Carefully remove any foreign objects. Use gloves for safety. A pair of pliers can help reach stubborn items.

### Deep Cleaning the Sump and Drain Area

After removing visible debris, you can perform a deeper clean. Mix a solution of hot water and white vinegar. Pour about one cup of vinegar into the sump. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Vinegar helps dissolve grease and mineral deposits. It also neutralizes odors. After soaking, run a short wash cycle. Do not add detergent or dishes. This helps flush out any loosened debris.

You can also use baking soda. Sprinkle a half cup of baking soda into the sump. Then pour a cup of hot vinegar over it. This creates a fizzing action. It helps loosen tough clogs. Let it sit for 15 minutes. Then run a rinse cycle. This method is effective for maintaining drain health. It prevents future clogs. Consistent cleaning of the filter and sump extends the life of your Miele dishwasher. It keeps it draining well.

## Inspecting the Drain Hose: Kinks, Clogs, and Proper Installation

Your **Miele dishwasher is not draining** if its drain hose has problems. The drain hose carries wastewater from the dishwasher to your home's drain system. It connects to a drainpipe under the sink or to a garbage disposal. Issues with this hose are common. They stop water from leaving the dishwasher. You need to check the entire length of the hose.

First, look for kinks or bends in the hose. The hose can get squeezed behind the dishwasher. This happens if the dishwasher moved during installation or use. A kink acts like a dam. It stops water flow. Gently pull the dishwasher out to check the hose behind it. Straighten any bends you find. Ensure the hose has enough slack. This prevents future kinks.

Second, check for clogs inside the drain hose. Food debris, grease, and even soap scum can build up. This forms a blockage. Disconnect the drain hose from both ends. Have a bucket ready. Water will spill out. You can disconnect it from the dishwasher first. Then disconnect it from the sink drain or garbage disposal. Blow through the hose to check for air flow. If you feel resistance, there is a clog.

### Clearing Drain Hose Blockages and Checking Installation

To clear a drain hose clog, use a long, flexible brush. A plumber's snake can also work. Push it through the hose to break up the blockage. Flush the hose with water. Make sure water flows freely. If the hose is severely clogged, consider replacing it. A new hose ensures better drainage.

Also, check the drain hose installation. The hose must have a high loop. This is a common requirement for many dishwashers. A high loop prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It also stops siphoning. Siphoning causes water to drain prematurely. This leads to poor wash results. The high loop should be at least 32 inches above the floor. Secure it with a clamp or strap. Without a high loop, your Miele dishwasher may not drain correctly. Proper drain hose installation is key. Some issues, like a [Miele dishwasher leaking water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-miele-dishwasher-leaking-water), can also be related to hose problems.

## Garbage Disposal Connection Issues for Miele Dishwashers

If your **Miele dishwasher is not draining** and it connects to a garbage disposal, this connection is a likely suspect. Many homes connect their dishwasher drain hose directly to the garbage disposal unit. This is a common setup. However, it can cause drainage problems if not set up correctly.

The most common issue is the knockout plug. When a new garbage disposal is installed, it often has a plug inside the dishwasher inlet. This plug prevents water from flowing into the disposal until you connect the dishwasher. If the dishwasher drain hose connects to the disposal but the knockout plug is still in place, your dishwasher cannot drain. Water gets stuck in the tub.

To check for the knockout plug, you must disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the garbage disposal. Place a bucket underneath to catch any water. Use a screwdriver or punch to push the knockout plug into the disposal chamber. It might be hard to see. Once inside, you can retrieve it or let the disposal grind it up. Then reattach the drain hose securely. Make sure the hose clamp is tight.

### Addressing Disposal Clogs and Proper Usage

Even if the knockout plug is gone, a clogged garbage disposal can stop your Miele dishwasher from draining. Food waste can back up into the dishwasher drain hose. This creates a blockage. Run your garbage disposal often. Make sure it is clear before starting a dishwasher cycle.

To clear a disposal clog, turn on your garbage disposal with cold water running. Grind up any food waste. If the disposal is not working, try resetting it. There is usually a small red reset button on the bottom of the unit. Press it firmly. Then try running the disposal again. A well-functioning garbage disposal is vital for a Miele dishwasher's drainage. If you are having draining issues with other appliances, problems like [why is my Maytag dishwasher not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-maytag-dishwasher-not-draining) or [how to fix Bosch dishwasher not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-bosch-dishwasher-not-draining) often share similar solutions related to the disposal.

## Understanding Your Miele Drain Pump: Troubleshooting and Replacement

The drain pump is a vital part if your **Miele dishwasher is not draining**. This pump pushes the wastewater out of the dishwasher and into your home's drain system. If the pump is faulty or blocked, water stays in the tub. A Miele drain pump is powerful. But it can still fail.

First, listen for sounds. When the dishwasher should be draining, listen for the pump motor. Do you hear a humming noise but no water movement? This suggests a blockage inside the pump or its impeller. Do you hear nothing at all? This could mean the pump motor is dead or not getting power. A loud grinding noise suggests something is caught in the pump.

To inspect the drain pump, you often need to remove the lower spray arm and the filter assembly. Look into the sump area. The drain pump is usually at the bottom, just behind where the filter sits. Shine a flashlight. Look for small objects caught near the impeller. These can be broken glass, plastic, or hard food bits. Carefully remove any visible obstructions. Always unplug the dishwasher before doing this.

### When to Replace the Miele Drain Pump

If the pump is clear of blockages but still not draining, the pump itself might be faulty. Test the pump for power. Use a multimeter if you are comfortable with electrical testing. No power means a wiring problem or control board issue. Power but no action means a bad motor.

Replacing a Miele drain pump is a more complex task. It often requires pulling the dishwasher out from its cabinet. You need to disconnect water lines and electrical connections. The pump is usually located under the dishwasher, accessed from the bottom. This job often requires a professional technician. Miele parts are specific. Using the correct replacement part is crucial. If you are unsure, it is best to call a Miele service expert. They have the right tools and knowledge. Getting professional help ensures your Miele dishwasher drains properly again.

## Faulty Check Valve: Preventing Water from Draining

A common reason your **Miele dishwasher is not draining** can be a problem with its check valve. The check valve is a small, one-way valve. It is located near the drain pump or in the drain hose assembly. Its job is to prevent dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher tub after it has been pumped out. It ensures water only moves in one direction: out.

If this check valve gets stuck in a closed position, it will prevent water from draining out. Even if the drain pump works perfectly, the valve acts as a barrier. Conversely, if it gets stuck open, it can allow water to siphon back into the tub from the drain line. While not directly preventing drainage, it creates the appearance of no draining by refilling the tub.

To inspect the check valve, you usually need to access the drain pump area. This often involves removing the lower spray arm and filter. The check valve might be a small rubber flapper or a ball valve. It is typically found at the output of the drain pump or inside the drain hose connection point on the dishwasher. Look for any debris, like food particles or mineral buildup, that might be preventing it from opening or closing properly.

### Cleaning or Replacing the Check Valve

Carefully remove the check valve if possible. Some are easy to pop out. Others are integrated into a housing. Clean the valve thoroughly. Use warm water and a small brush. Make sure it moves freely. If the flapper is torn, or the valve seems damaged, you will need to replace it.

Replacing a check valve is generally simpler than replacing a drain pump. However, it still requires some disassembly of the dishwasher's drain system. Ensure you purchase the correct Miele-specific check valve. A non-OEM part might not fit or function correctly. Reinstall the new or cleaned valve. Ensure it is oriented correctly for one-way flow. This small component plays a big role in keeping your Miele dishwasher draining efficiently and preventing standing water.

## Water Level Sensor and Float Switch: Miele's Internal Mechanisms

Sometimes, your **Miele dishwasher is not draining** due to issues with its internal sensors. The water level sensor and float switch are critical components. They tell the dishwasher how much water is inside. This prevents overfilling and ensures proper operation during cycles. If these sensors malfunction, the dishwasher might not complete a drain cycle.

The float switch is a safety device. It typically sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. If the water level rises too high, the float rises with it. This activates a switch. The switch tells the control board to stop filling with water. It can also trigger the drain pump to empty the tub. If the float switch is stuck in the "up" position, the dishwasher might think it is full. It will then try to drain continuously or not fill at all. If it is stuck "down", it might overfill.

To check the float switch, remove the lower spray arm and filter. The float is usually a small plastic cup or cylinder. It moves up and down. Make sure it moves freely. Clear any debris that might be trapping it. Food particles or even mineral buildup can stop it from moving. Clean the area around the float switch. Ensure its movement is smooth.

### Troubleshooting the Water Level Sensor

The water level sensor, also known as a pressure sensor, detects the water level using air pressure. It communicates this information to the control board. If this sensor is faulty or its associated hose is clogged, the dishwasher might get incorrect readings. It might think there is no water to drain. Or it might think the tub is always full. This leads to improper draining.

Troubleshooting the water level sensor is more complex. It usually involves accessing components under the dishwasher. You would need to check the air trap and the hose leading to the sensor for blockages. These can get clogged with detergent residue or grease. Clearing these can sometimes restore sensor function. If the sensor itself is faulty, it will need replacement. This is a job for a qualified technician. A bad sensor can lead to cycles taking too long or incorrect draining. This is similar to issues like [why does my Miele dishwasher take so long](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-miele-dishwasher-take-so-long). Always ensure you understand the issue fully or seek professional help when dealing with sensors and electronics.

## Control Board and Electrical Malfunctions: Advanced Miele Issues

If your **Miele dishwasher is not draining** after checking all physical blockages and the drain pump, the problem might be electrical. The control board is the "brain" of your Miele dishwasher. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump. Electrical issues or a faulty control board can prevent the pump from activating. This means no draining happens.

Signs of a control board issue include erratic behavior. The dishwasher might stop mid-cycle. It might display error codes related to drainage. The lights on the control panel might flicker. Or no lights come on at all. Sometimes, the pump gets no power signal from the board. This leaves standing water.

Troubleshooting a control board requires electrical knowledge. You need a multimeter to test voltage. You also need to know how to read wiring diagrams specific to your Miele model. Always unplug the dishwasher before attempting any electrical checks. A control board can suffer from power surges. It can also fail due to age. Sometimes, a loose wire connection is the issue. Check all wires leading to the drain pump and other components. Ensure they are secure.

### When to Call a Professional for Electrical Repairs

Replacing a control board is a complex repair. The part itself can be expensive. It requires careful handling. A wrong installation can cause more damage. For these reasons, I recommend calling a Miele service technician for control board or electrical malfunctions. They have specialized diagnostic tools. They can accurately identify the problem. They also ensure the repair is safe and effective.

Attempting complex electrical repairs yourself can be dangerous. It can also void your Miele warranty. A professional service technician can diagnose complex issues. They handle the specific Miele parts required. They will get your Miele dishwasher draining again safely.

## Professional Help: When to Contact Miele Service

Sometimes, your **Miele dishwasher is not draining**, and you have tried everything. You have cleaned the filters. You checked the drain hose. You looked at the air gap and garbage disposal.
