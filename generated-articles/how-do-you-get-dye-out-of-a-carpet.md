## Getting Dye Out Of Carpet: Your Ultimate Guide

A dye spill on your carpet can feel like a major disaster. One minute everything is fine, and the next, a bright, unwanted splash mars your floor. Knowing how to get dye out of a carpet quickly and correctly saves you stress and money. I understand the panic that sets in when you see that colorful blotch.

This guide helps you tackle dye stains head-on. We will cover immediate actions, effective home remedies, and advanced cleaning techniques. You will learn about specific dye types, necessary tools, and when professional help is best. My aim is to equip you with the knowledge to restore your carpet's original look.

### Takeaway

*   **Act Fast:** Blot the stain immediately; never rub.
*   **Test First:** Always test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area.
*   **Use the Right Products:** Match your cleaning agent to the dye type and carpet material.
*   **Blot, Don't Rub:** Gentle blotting lifts the stain; rubbing pushes it deeper.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Remove all cleaning solution residue to prevent future issues.
*   **Consider Professionals:** For large or stubborn stains, professional help saves your carpet.

### Answer to the Main Query

To get dye out of a carpet, act quickly by blotting the spill to absorb excess dye. Then, depending on the dye type and carpet material, apply a suitable cleaning solution like dish soap, vinegar, rubbing alcohol, or hydrogen peroxide. Always test the solution first, blot the stain gently, and rinse thoroughly to remove residue.

## Understanding Dye Stains and Your Carpet

When dye hits your carpet, several factors decide how tough the stain will be. The type of dye and your carpet material play big roles. Permanent dyes, for example, are much harder to remove than washable ones. I always try to identify the dye source first.

Different carpets react differently to cleaners. Natural fibers like wool can shrink or discolor with strong chemicals. Synthetic fibers like nylon or polyester are generally more durable. Knowing your carpet helps you choose the safest and most effective cleaning method. This initial understanding prevents you from making the problem worse.

### Common Dye Types You Might Encounter

Dye spills come from many sources, each posing unique challenges. Hair dye, for instance, often contains strong chemical agents. Fabric dyes from clothing or craft projects vary widely in their composition. Even food coloring, while less aggressive, can leave vibrant stains.

*   **Hair Dye:** These dyes are formulated to be permanent. They penetrate deeply into fibers. This makes them one of the toughest to remove.
*   **Fabric Dye:** Often used in crafting or laundry accidents. These can be water-soluble or more permanent. The permanence depends on the fabric and dye type.
*   **Food Coloring:** Found in drinks, candies, or cooking. These dyes are usually water-soluble. They are often easier to remove than other types.
*   **Ink Dyes:** From pens or markers. These can be alcohol-based or water-based. Their removal depends on the solvent used.

### Identifying Your Carpet Fiber

Before applying any cleaner, you must know your carpet's fiber type. This information is usually on the carpet's tag or your home's original specifications. Using the wrong product can damage your carpet irreversibly. I always recommend checking before you start.

*   **Synthetic Fibers (Nylon, Polyester, Olefin):** These are common and generally stain-resistant. They tolerate a wider range of cleaning solutions. However, excessive scrubbing can damage them.
*   **Natural Fibers (Wool, Cotton, Silk):** These are more delicate. They can be sensitive to harsh chemicals and excessive moisture. Wool, for example, can shrink or yellow. You must use gentler, pH-neutral cleaners for these.
*   **Blends:** Many carpets use a mix of natural and synthetic fibers. Treat these as if they are natural fibers. This ensures you do not damage the more sensitive component.

Understanding these details helps you choose the right approach. It sets the stage for a successful stain removal process. Without this knowledge, you risk permanent damage to your carpet.

## Essential Tools and Materials for Dye Removal

Having the right tools ready makes a huge difference in dye removal. You do not want to stop mid-process to search for supplies. Gathering everything beforehand saves precious time. I always assemble my cleaning arsenal before I start.

These items are usually found around the house or at a local store. Being prepared helps you tackle the stain efficiently. This preparation is a crucial first step for any successful cleaning project. It also reduces panic when a spill occurs.

### Must-Have Cleaning Supplies

These are the basic items you will need for most dye removal attempts. They form the foundation of your stain-fighting kit. I keep many of these on hand for general spills.

*   **Clean White Cloths or Paper Towels:** These are for blotting. White materials prevent color transfer to your carpet. I use many of these during the process.
*   **Spray Bottle:** Handy for applying cleaning solutions evenly. This helps avoid over-saturating the carpet. A fine mist is better than a direct pour.
*   **Empty Bowls or Buckets:** For mixing solutions and rinsing cloths. Having separate containers is important.
*   **Soft Brush or Old Toothbrush:** For gently working solutions into the carpet fibers. Avoid stiff brushes that could damage fibers.
*   **Vacuum Cleaner:** For preparing the area and cleaning up residue. A powerful vacuum ensures thorough drying.

### Recommended Cleaning Agents

The specific cleaning agents you use depend on the dye and carpet type. Start with milder options and only move to stronger ones if needed. Always test these on a hidden spot first.

*   **Dish Soap (Mild, clear liquid):** Effective for many water-soluble dyes. It breaks down the dye without harsh chemicals. I prefer brands like Dawn.
*   **White Vinegar:** An acidic solution that helps lift many stains. It is safe for most carpets. It also helps neutralize odors.
*   **Rubbing Alcohol (Isopropyl Alcohol):** Good for ink dyes and some fabric dyes. It acts as a solvent. Use it sparingly.
*   **Hydrogen Peroxide (3% solution):** A mild bleaching agent, best for light-colored carpets. It can lighten or remove permanent dyes. [Learn more about what gets dye out of carpet here.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-gets-dye-out-of-carpet)
*   **Non-Gel Toothpaste (White):** Can sometimes help with small, fresh stains. It has mild abrasive and cleaning agents.
*   **Commercial Carpet Stain Remover:** Specifically formulated for various stains. Choose one suitable for dye removal. Always follow product instructions carefully.
*   **Ammonia (Clear, non-sudsing):** Use diluted, and only on synthetic carpets. Never mix with bleach, as it creates toxic fumes. This is a stronger option.

### Safety Gear

Your safety is important when dealing with cleaning chemicals. Protect your hands and ensure good ventilation. I always put safety first.

*   **Rubber Gloves:** Protect your skin from irritation. Some chemicals can be harsh.
*   **Good Ventilation:** Open windows or use a fan. This prevents inhaling fumes.
*   **Old Clothes:** Wear clothes you do not mind getting stained. Accidents happen even when you are cleaning.

By preparing thoroughly, you increase your chances of successfully removing the dye. You also ensure a safer cleaning experience for yourself. This proactive approach saves you time and potential frustration.

## Immediate Action: The First Steps After a Dye Spill

When dye spills on your carpet, time is of the essence. The faster you act, the higher your chances of complete removal. I know it's easy to panic, but staying calm and acting quickly is key. Do not hesitate; start the cleaning process immediately.

Immediate action prevents the dye from setting deep into the carpet fibers. It also minimizes the area the dye can spread to. This initial response lays the groundwork for successful stain removal.

### Blotting Excess Dye: Do Not Rub!

The very first thing to do is remove as much excess dye as possible. This is where blotting comes in. Grab your clean white cloths or paper towels.

*   **Gently Blot:** Press the clean cloth onto the stain. Apply light pressure. The goal is to absorb the liquid dye.
*   **Work from Outside In:** Start at the edges of the stain and move towards the center. This stops the dye from spreading outwards.
*   **Change Cloths Frequently:** Use a fresh, clean section of cloth each time. You want to pick up dye, not spread it around. Keep blotting until no more dye transfers to the cloth.
*   **Avoid Rubbing:** Rubbing pushes the dye deeper into the carpet fibers. It also spreads the stain and can damage the carpet pile. Patience with blotting is far more effective.

### Preventing the Stain from Setting

Once you have blotted up the excess liquid, you need to prevent the remaining dye from drying and setting. A fresh stain is always easier to remove than an old, dry one. I find keeping the stain moist with a gentle solution helps.

*   **Lightly Dampen with Water:** If the dye is water-soluble, lightly mist the stain with cool water. Then, continue blotting. Do not soak the carpet.
*   **Apply a Pre-Treatment (Optional):** For stubborn or permanent dyes, you might apply a very mild pre-treatment. A small amount of dish soap diluted in water can help. Apply it gently, then blot.
*   **Keep the Area Moist:** If you cannot immediately proceed with full cleaning, keep the stained area slightly damp. Place a lightly moistened cloth over it. This delays the dye from bonding permanently with the fibers.

### Why Speed Matters

The chemical bonds in dye begin to set rapidly, especially with certain types of dye. The longer the dye sits, the harder it becomes to break these bonds. A quick response can turn a potential permanent stain into a minor clean-up.

*   **Fiber Absorption:** Carpet fibers, particularly natural ones, are highly absorbent. They soak up liquids quickly.
*   **Dye Bonding:** Dyes are designed to bond with fabric fibers. This bonding process strengthens over time.
*   **Reduced Damage:** Fast action not only helps remove the stain but also reduces the need for harsh chemicals later. This minimizes potential damage to your carpet.

By taking these immediate steps, you significantly improve your chances of successfully removing the dye. This initial vigilance can save you a lot of effort and worry later. Remember, a quick and gentle approach is your best defense against dye stains.

## Common Household Remedies for Dye Stains

After the initial blotting, it's time to tackle the remaining stain with common household products. Many everyday items in your pantry or cleaning cabinet can be surprisingly effective. I always recommend starting with the mildest option first. This protects your carpet from potential damage.

Remember to always test any solution on an inconspicuous spot of your carpet before applying it to the main stain. This patch test ensures the solution will not discolor or damage your specific carpet material.

### Dish Soap and Water Solution

A simple dish soap solution is often your first and best line of defense for water-soluble dyes. It's gentle yet effective.

*   **Prepare the Solution:** Mix one teaspoon of clear, mild dish soap with one cup of cool water in a spray bottle or bowl. Avoid dish soaps with strong dyes or moisturizers.
*   **Apply and Blot:** Lightly spray the solution onto a clean white cloth. Then, gently blot the stained area with the damp cloth.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Once the dye starts to lift, use another clean cloth dampened with plain cool water to rinse the area. Blot dry with a fresh, dry cloth. Repeat these steps until the stain is gone.

### White Vinegar and Water Mix

White vinegar is a natural acid that can break down many types of dyes. It's safe for most carpets, particularly synthetic ones. It also helps neutralize odors.

*   **Mix the Solution:** Combine equal parts white vinegar and cool water in a spray bottle.
*   **Apply to Stain:** Spray the solution directly onto the dye stain. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the vinegar to work on the dye.
*   **Blot and Rinse:** Blot the area thoroughly with a clean white cloth. The dye should transfer to the cloth. Rinse by blotting with plain water, then blot dry.
*   **Repeat if Necessary:** For persistent stains, you might need to repeat the process a few times.

### Rubbing Alcohol for Solvent-Based Dyes

Rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) is excellent for solvent-based dyes, such as many inks and some permanent fabric dyes. It acts as a solvent, breaking down the dye's chemical structure.

*   **Test First:** Always test rubbing alcohol on a hidden area of your carpet. It can sometimes affect carpet dyes, especially on natural fibers.
*   **Apply with Caution:** Dampen a clean white cloth with rubbing alcohol. Do not pour it directly onto the carpet.
*   **Blot Gently:** Blot the dye stain with the alcohol-dampened cloth. You should see the dye transferring to the cloth. [For specific advice on hair dye, consider reading how to get hair dye out of carpet.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-hair-dye-out-of-carpet)
*   **Follow with Soap and Water:** After the dye is gone, follow up with a dish soap and water solution to clean the alcohol residue. Then rinse and blot dry.
*   **Ensure Ventilation:** Use rubbing alcohol in a well-ventilated area due to its fumes.

Using these common household remedies can often solve a dye spill quickly. They offer a gentle yet effective way to remove many stains. Remember to be patient and persistent, as some stains require multiple applications.

## Tackling Stubborn Dye Stains

Sometimes, regular household remedies are not enough. Some dyes, especially permanent ones or those that have sat for too long, require stronger approaches. This is when I consider using more potent cleaning agents. However, these methods come with higher risks, so proceed with extra caution and thorough testing.

Always remember that these stronger solutions can be harsh. They might affect your carpet's color or texture. Testing on an inconspicuous area is not just a suggestion; it's a requirement.

### Hydrogen Peroxide (3% Solution)

Hydrogen peroxide is a mild bleaching agent. It is particularly effective on light-colored carpets for permanent dyes like hair dye. It can lighten or remove the stain.

*   **Test on Hidden Area:** Apply a small amount of 3% hydrogen peroxide to a hidden spot. Wait 30 minutes to an hour. Check for any discoloration or damage. This step is critical.
*   **Apply to Stain:** Once safe, pour a small amount of 3% hydrogen peroxide directly onto the dye stain. Do not over-saturate.
*   **Allow to Sit:** Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. You might see the dye bubbling or fading.
*   **Blot Thoroughly:** Blot the area with a clean white cloth. The dye should transfer.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse by blotting with plain cool water. Then, blot dry with fresh, dry cloths.
*   **Repeat if Needed:** You can repeat the process once or twice if the stain remains. However, excessive use can bleach your carpet.
*   **Use on White/Light Carpet Only:** Hydrogen peroxide can lighten carpet color. It is not suitable for dark or colored carpets. [If you're dealing with black dye on white carpet, this method is especially relevant.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-black-dye-out-of-white-carpet)

### Non-Gel White Toothpaste

Surprisingly, white, non-gel toothpaste can sometimes help with small, fresh dye stains. It contains mild abrasives and cleaning agents.

*   **Apply a Small Amount:** Put a pea-sized amount of white toothpaste directly onto the stain.
*   **Gently Scrub:** Use an old, soft toothbrush or your finger to gently rub the toothpaste into the stain.
*   **Rinse and Blot:** Wipe away the toothpaste with a clean, damp cloth. Then blot dry. This method works best for minor incidents.

### Commercial Carpet Stain Removers

Many specialized carpet stain removers are on the market. These are formulated to tackle tough stains, including dyes.

*   **Choose Wisely:** Look for products specifically labeled for dye removal. Read reviews and product descriptions.
*   **Follow Instructions Precisely:** Each product has unique instructions. Follow them exactly regarding application, dwell time, and rinsing.
*   **Test First:** Always test the commercial cleaner on an inconspicuous spot of your carpet. Check for colorfastness and any adverse reactions.
*   **Apply and Blot:** Apply the product as directed. Usually, you apply, let it sit, and then blot.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Most commercial removers require thorough rinsing to prevent residue buildup. Residue can attract dirt over time.

### Ammonia Solution (for Synthetic Carpets)

Ammonia can be very effective on tough, permanent dye stains on synthetic carpets. **Never use ammonia on wool or other natural fibers, and never mix it with bleach or products containing bleach.**

*   **Dilute Ammonia:** Mix one tablespoon of clear household ammonia with one cup of cool water.
*   **Test First:** Test on a hidden area of your synthetic carpet.
*   **Apply and Blot:** Apply the solution to a clean white cloth. Blot the stain gently.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse the area by blotting with plain water. Then blot dry.
*   **Ventilation is Key:** Ensure the area is very well-ventilated when using ammonia. The fumes can be strong.

Tackling stubborn dye stains requires patience and careful execution. By starting with the least aggressive method and working your way up, you increase your chances of success while minimizing carpet damage. Always prioritize testing and safety.

## Specific Dye Types: Hair Dye and Fabric Dye Challenges

Dealing with dye on your carpet is tough, but certain types of dye present unique challenges. Hair dye and fabric dye are two of the most common culprits. They are often designed to be permanent, making removal a real test. I've learned that understanding the specific dye helps immensely.

These dyes bond strongly with fibers. Knowing their properties guides you to the most effective cleaning strategy. It helps you avoid methods that might actually make the stain worse.

### Removing Hair Dye from Carpet

Hair dye is particularly notorious for staining carpets. It contains chemicals that penetrate and bond with hair, and carpet fibers are no different. [The question "does hair dye stain carpet?" is often answered with a resounding yes due to its potent nature.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-hair-dye-stain-carpet)

*   **Immediate Action is Crucial:** Blot up as much wet dye as possible right away. Use clean white cloths.
*   **Dish Soap and Vinegar:** Start with a dish soap and water solution. If that doesn't work, try a white vinegar and water mix. Apply, blot, rinse, and repeat.
*   **Rubbing Alcohol (Isopropyl Alcohol):** For tougher hair dye stains, rubbing alcohol can be very effective.
    *   Dampen a clean white cloth with rubbing alcohol.
    *   Blot the stain, working from the outside in.
    *   Change cloths frequently as dye transfers.
    *   Follow with a dish soap solution and rinse well.
*   **Hydrogen Peroxide (3% Solution):** This is often the most effective for set-in hair dye stains, especially on light-colored carpets.
    *   Test on an inconspicuous spot first.
    *   Apply a small amount of 3% hydrogen peroxide to the stain.
    *   Let it sit for 15-30 minutes.
    *   Blot thoroughly with a clean cloth.
    *   Rinse with plain water and blot dry.
    *   Be aware: Hydrogen peroxide can bleach darker carpets.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Some people find success with a paste of baking soda and a little water. Apply it to the stain, let it dry, then vacuum. This can absorb some dye.

### Removing Fabric Dye (e.g., from clothes, tie-dye kits)

Fabric dyes from laundry accidents, craft projects, or tie-dye can also be very challenging. These dyes are designed to color textiles permanently.

*   **Act Quickly:** As with hair dye, immediate blotting of wet dye is vital.
*   **Dish Soap and Water:** Begin with the mild dish soap and water solution. Blot the stain, rinse, and repeat.
*   **White Vinegar Solution:** If dish soap doesn't work, try the white vinegar and water mix. It's often effective on many fabric dyes.
*   **Commercial Stain Remover:** A commercial carpet stain remover specifically designed for fabric dyes can be highly effective. Always read product labels carefully.
    *   Test the product in an inconspicuous area first.
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and dwell time.
    *   Blot the stain, then rinse thoroughly.
*   **Ammonia Solution (Synthetic Carpets Only):** For stubborn fabric dye stains on synthetic carpets, a diluted ammonia solution can work.
    *   Mix 1 tablespoon of clear ammonia with 1 cup of water.
    *   Apply with a clean cloth, blot, rinse, and dry.
    *   **Crucial:** Never use on wool or natural fibers, and ensure good ventilation.
*   **For Tie-Dye Stains:** Tie-dye dyes are often quite concentrated. The methods for general fabric dyes apply, but you might need more persistence. [A dedicated guide on how to get tie-dye out of carpet can offer more detailed steps.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-tie-dye-out-of-carpet)

Dealing with hair and fabric dyes requires patience, persistence, and often a multi-pronged approach. Always proceed with caution and remember to test every product on a hidden spot. Your goal is to remove the stain without damaging your carpet.

## When to Call the Professionals

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a dye stain just won't budge. Or perhaps the stain is too large, too old, or the dye too permanent for DIY methods. I know it's tempting to keep trying, but there comes a point when calling in professional carpet cleaners is the wisest decision. They have specialized tools and expertise that we do not.

Recognizing your limits can save your carpet from irreversible damage. Professionals often have access to industrial-strength cleaners and advanced techniques that are not available to the average homeowner. They can assess the dye type and carpet fiber accurately.

### Types of Stains Best Left to Experts

Certain dye stains are notoriously difficult and often require professional intervention. Pushing too hard with DIY methods can worsen the problem.

*   **Large Dye Spills:** If an entire bottle of dye spills, the sheer volume makes it hard for a homeowner to manage. Professionals have powerful extraction equipment.
*   **Old, Set-In Stains:** Dyes that have dried and bonded deeply with carpet fibers are much harder to remove. Professionals can often break down these older bonds.
*   **Permanent Dyes:** Some dyes are chemically formulated to be truly permanent. Even hydrogen peroxide might not fully remove them. These require professional-grade solvents.
*   **Delicate Carpet Fibers:** Wool, silk, and antique rugs are highly susceptible to damage from harsh chemicals or excessive moisture. Professionals know how to treat these materials gently.
*   **Unknown Dye Types:** If you do not know what kind of dye spilled, it is safer to let an expert identify it. They can then choose the correct removal strategy.
*   **Stains You've Already Tried to Remove:** If you've attempted multiple DIY methods without success, further attempts might just set the stain deeper or damage the carpet.

### The Benefits of Professional Carpet Cleaning

Hiring professionals offers several advantages that go beyond just stain removal. They provide a comprehensive service that ensures your carpet's longevity and appearance.

*   **Specialized Knowledge:** Professionals have extensive knowledge of different carpet types and dye chemistries. They can identify the exact type of dye and tailor their approach.
*   **Advanced Equipment:** They use powerful steam cleaners, hot water extraction units, and commercial-grade vacuums. This equipment provides a deeper clean and faster drying times.
*   **Industrial-Strength Cleaners:** Access to cleaning solutions much stronger than anything available to consumers. These chemicals are formulated to break down stubborn dyes.
*   **No Risk of Damage:** Professionals are trained to remove stains without damaging your carpet's color, texture, or backing. They understand pH levels and material compatibility.
*   **Time and Effort Saving:** DIY dye removal can be time-consuming and frustrating. Professionals get the job done efficiently.
*   **Odor Removal:** Beyond removing the visible stain, they can also eliminate any lingering odors associated with the dye or cleaning solutions.
*   **Warranty Protection:** Many carpet manufacturers specify professional cleaning to maintain warranties.

### How to Choose a Professional Cleaner

If you decide to call in the experts, choose wisely. Not all carpet cleaners are created equal.

*   **Look for IICRC Certification:** The Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC) is a reputable organization. Certification indicates a high level of training and expertise.
*   **Ask for Dye Removal Experience:** Specifically inquire about their experience with dye stains. Ask if they have before-and-after photos.
*   **Get Multiple Quotes:** Contact a few companies for estimates. Compare prices, services, and guarantees.
*   **Read Reviews:** Check online reviews and ask for local references.
*   **Discuss Guarantees:** A reputable cleaner will offer some form of satisfaction guarantee.

While DIY methods are great for many stains, knowing when to call the pros is a sign of smart home maintenance. They are an investment that often saves you from replacing an entire carpet.

## Preventive Measures and Future Protection

Dealing with a dye stain is a stressful experience. The best way to avoid it is by preventing spills in the first place. Taking proactive steps can save you a lot of time, money, and worry. I always emphasize prevention as the ultimate cleaning strategy.

Protecting your carpet from future dye disasters does not have to be difficult. Simple habits and a few smart products can make a big difference.

### Smart Habits to Prevent Dye Spills

Everyday actions can significantly reduce the risk of dye spills. These are small changes that yield big results.

*   **Use Drop Cloths:** Whenever you are working with dyes – whether it's hair dye, fabric dye, or even painting – lay down old sheets or plastic drop cloths. Cover not just the immediate area but also a generous perimeter. I make sure to cover more than I think I need.
*   **Work in Designated Areas:** If possible, do dye-related activities in rooms without carpet, like a tiled bathroom or kitchen. If that's not possible, create a clear, protected zone.
*   **Handle Dyes Carefully:** Be mindful when pouring, mixing, or applying dyes. Keep containers stable and away from edges. Avoid rushing.
*   **Secure Lids Tightly:** Always double-check that dye bottles and containers are sealed properly after use. A loose lid is an accident waiting to happen.
*   **Avoid Placing Dye Containers on Carpet:** Never rest an open or even closed dye container directly on the carpet. Use a tray or a stable, hard surface.
*   **Supervise Children and Pets:** Keep children and pets away from areas where dyes are in use. Their natural curiosity can lead to accidental spills.

### Carpet Protection Strategies

Beyond avoiding spills, you can also treat your carpet to make it more resistant to stains. These strategies add an extra layer of defense.

*   **Carpet Protector Sprays:** Many brands offer fabric or carpet protector sprays. These create an invisible barrier on the carpet fibers. This barrier repels liquids, making spills bead up instead of soaking in.
    *   **Apply Regularly:** These treatments are not permanent. Reapply them every 6-12 months, or after professional cleaning.
    *   **Test First:** Always test the spray on an inconspicuous area to ensure it does not alter carpet color or texture.
*   **Area Rugs:** For high-traffic areas or spots prone to spills (like under a dining table or near a craft station), place an area rug. It protects the main carpet and is easier to clean or replace if stained. [You can even dye area rugs if they get old and faded.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-dye-area-rugs)
*   **Mats and Runners:** Use mats at entryways to reduce dirt and grime tracked onto carpets. Runners in hallways protect against wear and potential spills.
