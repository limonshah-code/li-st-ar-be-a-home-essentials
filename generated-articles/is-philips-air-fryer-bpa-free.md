**Is Philips Air Fryer BPA Free?** Yes, Philips actively states that the food-contact parts of their air fryers are free from BPA. They design their products with consumer health in mind. This means the basket, drawer, and other surfaces that touch your food do not contain Bisphenol A.

### Understanding BPA: Why It Matters for Your Kitchen Appliances

BPA stands for Bisphenol A. It is an industrial chemical. Manufacturers have used it to make certain plastics and resins since the 1950s. These materials include polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Polycarbonate plastics are often in food containers. They are also in water bottles. Epoxy resins coat the inside of metal products. These include food cans and bottle tops.

The concern with BPA comes from its ability to leach. Small amounts of BPA can move from containers into food or drinks. This happens more when containers are heated. High temperatures in an air fryer could potentially cause this. Many studies have explored the effects of BPA on health. Some studies suggest BPA can affect the brain and prostate gland of fetuses, infants, and children. It can also impact children's behavior.

The FDA says BPA is safe at very low levels. However, consumer groups push for its removal. This is why "BPA-free" labels became common. People want to avoid possible risks.
