Heat pumps use refrigerant to absorb and release heat. A compressor circulates the refrigerant between an indoor coil and an outdoor coil. This cycle allows the system to extract heat from one place and release it into another. This process is very different from a furnace that burns fuel for heat. It also differs from an air conditioner that only provides cooling.

Because heat pumps move heat, they use less energy than systems that generate heat. This efficiency translates into lower utility bills. Many people find their homes more comfortable with a heat pump. The system provides steady heating and cooling without extreme temperature swings. This steady operation contributes to a pleasant indoor environment.

## The Financial Commitment: Heat Pump Installation Costs

The initial cost of installing a heat pump can be a major consideration. Prices vary widely based on several factors.
