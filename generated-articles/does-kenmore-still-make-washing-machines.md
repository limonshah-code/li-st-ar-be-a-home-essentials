This partnership meant Sears was a one-stop shop for Kenmore appliances. People trusted Kenmore for quality and affordable prices. Many homes relied on Kenmore washing machines for decades.

The combined strength of Kenmore's product line and Sears' retail power was unmatched for many years.

## Who Manufactures Kenmore Washing Machines Today?

Kenmore does not own any factories. Instead, it licenses its brand name to various manufacturers. These manufacturers build the washing machines under the Kenmore label. This business model allows Kenmore to offer a wide range of appliances. It also lets them adapt to market changes quickly. This practice is common in the appliance industry. Many brands operate this way.

Over the years, several major appliance companies have produced Kenmore washing machines. These include Whirlpool, LG, Samsung, and Electrolux. For example, some Kenmore models closely resembled Whirlpool or LG designs. This means a Kenmore washing machine might have internal components from one of these companies. The specific manufacturer can vary by model and year. This makes understanding your Kenmore appliance a bit more complex.

When you buy a Kenmore washing machine, you are buying a product made by another company. The Kenmore badge means it meets Kenmore's specifications. It also means it comes with Kenmore's warranty and support. This system lets Kenmore focus on design and marketing. The manufacturing partners handle the actual production. It is a win-win for both sides.

### Past and Present Manufacturing Partners

Historically, Whirlpool was a primary manufacturer for Kenmore. Many older Kenmore washing machines were essentially rebranded Whirlpool models. This partnership brought reliability to Kenmore products. Whirlpool has a long history in appliance manufacturing. Their expertise helped build Kenmore's reputation.

In more recent times, other companies joined the list. LG and Samsung have also produced Kenmore washing machines. [Does LG make good washing machines](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-lg-make-good-washing-machines)? Many consumers believe so, and their technology often appeared in Kenmore's higher-end models. This allowed Kenmore to offer advanced features and modern designs. These partnerships reflect the global nature of appliance manufacturing. Companies constantly seek new ways to optimize production. This ensures the Kenmore brand remains competitive.

Today, various manufacturers still produce Kenmore appliances. The exact company can change. It depends on the specific model and the current market agreements. Consumers can often find clues about the manufacturer by checking model numbers. Researching the model number can reveal similar appliances from other brands. This helps consumers understand the underlying technology. Knowing the manufacturer can also guide parts searches. It can also help with repair service selection.

## Where to Find Kenmore Washing Machines Now

The retail landscape for Kenmore washing machines has changed. Sears stores were once the exclusive sellers. Now, Sears has a much smaller retail presence. This means consumers need to look elsewhere for new Kenmore models. Fortunately, Kenmore washing machines are still available. You just need to know where to search.

Online retailers have become a major channel for Kenmore appliances. Websites specializing in home goods often carry Kenmore products. These platforms offer convenience for shoppers. You can compare models and read reviews from home. Online shopping provides a wide selection. It also often includes delivery and installation services. This makes buying a new washing machine easier.

Some independent appliance stores also carry Kenmore. These local shops may offer personalized service. They often have knowledgeable staff. They can help you select the right model. Checking with appliance dealers in your area is a good idea. They might have Kenmore models in stock. They can also order them for you.

Several major online retailers now list Kenmore washing machines. These include popular e-commerce sites. These sites act as a direct portal for many brands. They provide detailed product descriptions. You can view specifications and customer ratings. This helps in making an informed purchase decision.

Some specialized appliance websites also feature Kenmore. These platforms often have a broader selection of models. They might offer specific deals or bundles. My advice is to always check multiple sites. Compare prices and shipping options. Look for sites that offer appliance installation services. This can save you time and effort. [Does Best Buy have washing machines](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-best-buy-have-washing-machines)? Yes, and sometimes they carry Kenmore or Kenmore-related brands. Also, keep an eye out for appliance sales events. These can offer significant savings on Kenmore models.

When buying online, verify the seller's return policy. Also, check their warranty support for Kenmore appliances. Ensure you understand delivery and installation charges. Some retailers offer free delivery. Others might charge extra for complex installations. Reading the fine print avoids surprises. This careful approach ensures a smooth buying experience.

### Local Stores and Outlet Opportunities

While Sears' physical footprint has shrunk, some locations remain. These remaining Sears stores might still carry Kenmore appliances. It is worth checking if a Sears store operates near you. They might have a limited selection. However, they could offer competitive prices. Especially on floor models or clearance items.

Appliance outlet stores are another option. These stores sell new, open-box, or slightly damaged appliances. You might find Kenmore washing machines there at reduced prices. These items often come with a warranty. It is important to inspect the appliance carefully before buying. Check for any cosmetic damage. Ensure all parts are present. Outlets can be a great way to save money.

Independent appliance dealers are a crucial resource. Many local shops have long-standing relationships with distributors. They may have access to Kenmore inventory. I always recommend supporting local businesses. They often provide excellent customer service. They can also help with future repairs or parts. Do not overlook these community-based options. They often have unique offerings.

## Are Kenmore Washing Machines Still a Good Buy?

Deciding if a Kenmore washing machine is a good buy requires thought. The brand's reputation for reliability remains strong for many. However, the current manufacturing model means performance can vary. Kenmore relies on different companies to build its machines. This means the quality of a new Kenmore unit depends on its specific manufacturer. It is wise to research the particular model you are considering.

Look for reviews of specific Kenmore washing machine models. These reviews can offer insights into durability and common issues. Pay attention to comments about noise levels, wash performance, and repair frequency. Understanding who made that particular model can also help. For instance, a Kenmore machine built by LG might share characteristics with LG-branded units. [How reliable are LG washing machines](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-reliable-are-lg-washing-machines)? This research helps set proper expectations.

Kenmore appliances often provide good value for money. They generally offer a solid set of features without a premium price tag. This balance makes them appealing to many buyers. However, always weigh the price against the features and reported reliability. Consider your personal laundry needs. A basic Kenmore model might be perfect for some households. Others might prefer more advanced features. This careful evaluation ensures you make the right choice.

### What to Consider Before Buying a New Kenmore

Before purchasing a Kenmore washing machine, assess its features. Do you need a top-load or front-load model? What capacity do you require for your household? Modern washing machines offer many cycles and settings. Consider if you need steam options or smart features. [Are smart washing machines worth it](https://homeessentialsguide.com/are-smart-washing-machines-worth-it)? Think about how these features fit into your laundry routine.

Energy efficiency is another important factor. Look for the Energy Star label. Energy-efficient models save money on utility bills over time. They also reduce your environmental footprint. Check the water usage ratings as well. Some models use less water per cycle. This is especially important if you live in an area with water restrictions.

Warranty coverage is essential. Understand the length and terms of the Kenmore warranty. Does it cover parts and labor? How long is the warranty period for major components like the motor? Knowing your warranty protects your investment. It also gives you peace of mind. Compare Kenmore's warranty to other brands. This helps you gauge its value.

## Maintaining Your Kenmore Washing Machine

Proper maintenance extends the life of any appliance. Your Kenmore washing machine is no exception. Regular care can prevent common problems. It also ensures efficient operation. I always tell people that a little bit of effort goes a long way. Taking good care of your washing machine saves money on repairs. It also keeps your clothes cleaner.

One simple step is to clean the dispenser drawers regularly. Detergent and fabric softener can build up. This buildup can block dispenser holes. It can also lead to mold or mildew growth. Use a damp cloth to wipe them out. For removable drawers, wash them in warm soapy water. This keeps your cleaning products flowing freely.

Inspect and clean the washing machine filter. Many front-load machines have a drain pump filter. This filter catches lint, coins, and other small items. A clogged filter can prevent proper draining. It can also cause odors. Refer to your owner's manual for filter location and cleaning instructions. I find cleaning it every few months works well.

### Essential Cleaning and Care Tips

After each wash cycle, leave the washing machine door ajar. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps prevent mold and mildew growth. Mold causes unpleasant odors in your washing machine and on your clothes. This simple habit keeps your machine smelling fresh. It also helps dry out the rubber gasket on front-loaders.

Run a cleaning cycle regularly. Most modern Kenmore washing machines have a "Clean Washer" cycle. Use a specialized washing machine cleaner or white vinegar. This helps remove detergent residue and mineral buildup. It also sanitizes the drum. I recommend doing this once a month. This practice keeps the interior spotless.

Check washing machine hoses for leaks or cracks. Old hoses can burst, causing significant water damage. Replace rubber hoses every 3-5 years. Braided stainless steel hoses offer more durability. Ensure connections are tight. This simple check protects your home from potential floods. This is a small task with big benefits. Also, remember to [how to drain Kenmore washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-kenmore-washing-machine) if you ever need to move it or clear a blockage.

### Troubleshooting Common Kenmore Issues

Sometimes, your Kenmore washing machine might act up. Common issues include unusual noises, clothes not spinning dry, or error codes. Before calling for service, check the simple things. Make sure the machine is level. An unbalanced load can cause loud vibrations. Redistribute clothes evenly in the drum.

If your clothes are still wet, check the drain hose. Ensure it is not kinked or clogged. A clogged pump filter can also prevent proper draining. Also, make sure the spin speed is set correctly. Sometimes, specific fabric settings use lower spin speeds. Adjust the setting if needed for drier clothes.

Error codes often point to specific problems. Your Kenmore owner's manual has a list of error codes. It also provides troubleshooting steps for each. For example, a "F7E1" code might mean a speed control issue. [How to reset my Kenmore washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-my-kenmore-washing-machine) is often the first step in clearing an error code. Unplugging the machine for a few minutes can sometimes reset the system. This can clear minor glitches.

## Kenmore Washing Machine Alternatives and Competitors

The appliance market offers many choices beyond Kenmore. If you are looking for a new washing machine, consider other reputable brands. These brands often offer similar features and price points. Researching alternatives helps you find the best fit for your home. It ensures you get the most value for your money.

Major competitors include Whirlpool, Maytag, LG, Samsung, and GE. Each brand has its strengths. Whirlpool and Maytag are known for durability and robust performance. LG and Samsung often feature innovative technology and sleek designs. GE offers a wide range of models at various price points. [Who makes KitchenAid washing machines](https://homeessentialsguide.com/who-makes-kitchenaid-washing-machines)? That would be Whirlpool, for example, showing how brands connect.

Think about what matters most to you. Do you prioritize energy efficiency, quiet operation, or smart features? Some brands excel in specific areas. Reading reviews and comparing specifications is helpful. Visit appliance showrooms to see models in person. This lets you compare features directly. It also helps you visualize the size in your laundry area.

When comparing washing machines, set a budget. Prices vary widely based on brand, features, and capacity. Entry-level models offer basic washing functions. High-end machines include many specialized cycles. They might have steam cleaning or automatic detergent dispensing. Decide which features are essential for you.

Consider the long-term cost of ownership. This includes the purchase price, energy costs, and potential repairs. Some cheaper models might consume more energy. They might also require more frequent repairs. A slightly more expensive model might save you money over time. It could offer better energy efficiency and durability.

Look for sales and promotions. Appliance retailers frequently offer discounts. Holidays are often good times to buy.
