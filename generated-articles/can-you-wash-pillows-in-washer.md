## Can You Wash Pillows In Washer? A Comprehensive Guide

Have you ever wondered if you can wash pillows in your washer? It is a common question. Many people use pillows nightly, but often neglect their cleaning needs. Over time, pillows collect dust mites, sweat, skin cells, and allergens. This buildup can affect your sleep quality and overall health. Knowing how to properly care for your pillows keeps them fresh and clean. This article will guide you through the process. We will explore various pillow types, preparation steps, and the best washing and drying methods.

**Takeaway:**

*   Most pillows, except solid foam and some latex, are safe for machine washing.
*   Always check the care label on your pillow before washing.
*   Use a gentle cycle, mild detergent, and warm or cool water for best results.
*   Wash two pillows at a time to balance the load in the washer.
*   Thoroughly dry pillows to prevent mold and mildew growth.

Yes, you can wash pillows in a washer, but it depends on the pillow material. Most synthetic and down or feather pillows are machine washable. Memory foam and solid latex pillows generally require spot cleaning or hand washing. Always check the care label before attempting to wash pillows in a washer.

### Understanding Pillow Types for Washing

Knowing your pillow type is the first step before you wash pillows in your washer. Different materials react differently to water and agitation. You want to avoid damaging your pillows or your washing machine. Checking the care label on each pillow provides essential instructions.

#### Down and Feather Pillows

Down and feather pillows are often washable. These pillows offer great comfort. They can accumulate allergens and dust mites quickly. Use a front-loading or top-loading washer without a central agitator. An agitator can damage the delicate feathers. Choose a gentle cycle with cold or warm water. You should also use a mild detergent. These steps protect the natural fill.

#### Synthetic Fiber Pillows

Most synthetic fiber pillows, like polyester fill, are easy to wash. These pillows are durable and hold their shape well. They are generally resistant to clumping. You can safely wash these pillows in most washing machines. Use a gentle cycle and warm water. A mild liquid detergent works best for these types. Synthetic pillows often spring back into shape after washing.

#### Memory Foam and Latex Pillows

Memory foam and solid latex pillows are usually not machine washable. Water can break down the foam structure. This makes the pillow brittle or causes it to crumble. For these types, spot cleaning is the best method. Use a damp cloth with a small amount of mild soap. Gently dab the stained area. Air dry completely before use. Some shredded memory foam pillows may be washable; always read the label. For specific guidance on these types, see [how to wash latex pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-latex-pillows) or [how to clean foam pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-foam-pillows).

#### Other Specialty Pillows

Pillows with buckwheat hulls, microbeads, or gel are typically not machine washable. These materials can absorb too much water or spill out. This can damage your washer. Always refer to the care label for these specific items. Many specialty pillows come with removable, washable covers. This makes maintenance easier.

### Preparing Your Pillows for the Washer

Proper preparation ensures a successful wash cycle. This step is important before you wash pillows in your washer. A little preparation goes a long way. It helps protect both your pillows and your appliance.

#### Inspect for Tears and Damage

Before washing, check each pillow for any rips or holes. Even a small tear can cause stuffing to escape during the wash. This can clog your machine or create a mess. If you find a small tear, sew it up with a needle and thread. Repairing it beforehand prevents larger issues. This simple check saves you time and effort later.

#### Remove Pillowcases and Protectors

Always remove pillowcases and pillow protectors. These items should be washed separately. Washing them together can prevent a thorough cleaning of the pillow itself. It also ensures that the pillow's material gets direct contact with water and detergent. This step helps in achieving maximum freshness.

#### Spot Treat Stains

Address any visible stains before putting the pillow in the washer. Use a mild stain remover or a mixture of water and gentle detergent. Apply it directly to the stain. Gently rub the area with a soft brush or cloth. Let it sit for a few minutes. This pre-treatment helps lift stubborn spots. It prepares the pillow for a deeper clean.

#### Load the Washer Correctly

Load two pillows at a time. This balances the washing machine drum. An unbalanced load can cause the machine to shake violently. It can also prevent thorough rinsing. If you have a top-loader with an agitator, place one pillow on each side of the agitator. For front-loaders, simply place them inside the drum. This ensures even distribution and better washing performance.

### The Right Washer Settings and Detergents

Choosing the correct settings and detergent is vital when you wash pillows in your washer. Incorrect choices can ruin your pillows. They can also leave them less than clean. Pay close attention to these details for the best outcome.

#### Selecting the Washer Cycle

A gentle or delicate cycle is usually the best choice for pillows. This setting minimizes agitation. It protects the pillow's fill material from damage. Avoid heavy-duty cycles, as they are too aggressive. Excessive spinning can cause clumping. It can also stress the pillow's seams. Some machines have a "bulky" or "bedding" setting. This might also be suitable. To learn more about specific settings, refer to [what setting to wash pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-setting-to-wash-pillows).

#### Water Temperature Considerations

Warm water is generally recommended for washing pillows. It helps to sanitize and remove allergens effectively. Hot water can sometimes damage synthetic fills. It can also shrink certain materials. Cold water is an option for very delicate pillows. It helps preserve colors and prevent fading. Always refer to the care label for precise temperature guidance.

#### Choosing the Right Detergent

Use a small amount of mild, liquid detergent. Powder detergents may not dissolve completely. They can leave residue on your pillows. Avoid using too much detergent. Excess suds are hard to rinse out. They can leave pillows feeling stiff or soapy. Look for detergents free of harsh chemicals or dyes. These can irritate skin. You only need about one tablespoon of detergent per pillow.

#### Adding an Extra Rinse Cycle

Consider adding an extra rinse cycle. This ensures all detergent is thoroughly removed. Leftover detergent can cause allergic reactions. It can also attract dust mites faster. An extra rinse ensures your pillows are truly clean and fresh. This step is often worth the extra time. It ensures no residue remains inside the pillow's stuffing.

### Washing Different Pillow Materials Safely

Washing pillows in a washer requires specific methods for different materials. Understanding these nuances helps keep your pillows in great condition. Each material has unique properties. These properties dictate the safest washing approach.

#### Washing Down and Feather Pillows

When washing down pillows, use a gentle cycle. Use cold or warm water. A small amount of liquid detergent is ideal. Place two pillows in the washer to balance the load. This prevents the machine from becoming unbalanced. Do not use bleach, as it can damage the natural feathers. An extra rinse cycle ensures all soap is gone. For more details, refer to [how to clean down pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-down-pillows).

#### Washing Synthetic and Polyester Pillows

Synthetic and polyester pillows are generally more resilient. Wash them on a gentle or delicate cycle with warm water. Use a mild liquid detergent. These pillows can sometimes be washed with a bit more agitation than down. However, sticking to a gentle cycle extends their lifespan. Wash two at a time for balance. Spin thoroughly to remove excess water.

#### Washing Shredded Memory Foam Pillows

Some shredded memory foam pillows are machine washable. This is different from solid memory foam. Always check the care label first. If machine washable, use a gentle cycle with cold water. Use a very small amount of mild liquid detergent. Agitation can break down the foam pieces. An extra rinse is crucial to remove all detergent. Ensure they are thoroughly dried afterward to prevent mold.

#### Important Washing Tips

*   **Avoid Overloading:** Never cram too many pillows into the washer. This prevents proper cleaning and rinsing. It can also damage your machine.
*   **Balance the Load:** Washing two pillows at a time balances the machine. This is crucial for efficient spinning. It also protects your washer from vibrations.
*   **No Fabric Softener:** Fabric softener can coat the pillow fibers. This makes them less fluffy and absorbent. Avoid using it for pillows.
*   **Pre-Soak Option:** For very dirty pillows, a pre-soak cycle can help. This loosens grime before the main wash. This is part of [how to deep clean pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-deep-clean-pillows).

### Drying Pillows Effectively After Washing

Drying pillows correctly is as important as washing them. Improper drying can lead to mildew. It can also cause clumping and damage. When you wash pillows in your washer, ensure you follow these drying steps.

#### Tumble Drying with Dryer Balls

Use a low heat setting on your dryer. High heat can damage natural and synthetic fibers. It can also cause shrinkage. Place two clean tennis balls or wool dryer balls in the dryer with the pillows. These balls help fluff the pillows. They prevent the fill from clumping. They also speed up the drying process. Check the pillows frequently.

#### Fluffing During Drying

Periodically remove the pillows from the dryer. Fluff them by hand. This redistributes the filling. It also helps expose damp spots to the air. This prevents moisture from getting trapped. It ensures even drying. This step is crucial for maintaining pillow loft. You can do this every 20-30 minutes during the drying cycle.

#### Ensuring Complete Dryness

Pillows must be completely dry before use or storage. Any remaining moisture can lead to mold and mildew. Squeeze and feel the pillow all over. Pay special attention to the center. If it feels even slightly damp, continue drying. It can take several hours for pillows to dry fully. Do not rush this process.

#### Air Drying Considerations

If you prefer, you can air dry pillows. Place them on a clean, flat surface in a well-ventilated area. Direct sunlight can help. However, sunlight can also yellow some fabrics. Rotate and flip the pillows often. This ensures even drying. Air drying can take a full day or longer. Combine air drying with a short tumble dry. This can speed up the process while maintaining freshness.

### Tips for Maintaining Pillow Cleanliness

Maintaining cleanliness extends pillow life. It also keeps your sleep environment healthy. Once you wash pillows in your washer, proper care helps keep them fresh longer. Simple habits make a big difference.

#### Use Pillow Protectors

Pillow protectors act as a barrier. They shield your pillows from sweat, oils, and allergens. These covers are usually zippered and washable. They are much easier to wash frequently than the pillow itself. Using protectors significantly reduces how often you need to wash the actual pillow. Change and wash protectors weekly with your bedding.

#### Regular Fluffing and Airing

Fluff your pillows daily. This helps to redistribute the fill. It maintains loft and shape. It also allows air to circulate through the pillow. This helps evaporate moisture. Periodically air out your pillows outdoors on a sunny, dry day. This refreshes them and helps kill dust mites. This simple act reduces dust and allergens.

#### Address Spills Immediately

Clean spills or stains as soon as they happen. Immediate action prevents stains from setting. Use a damp cloth with a mild cleaner. Dab the area gently. Avoid rubbing, which can spread the stain. Quick action reduces the need for full machine washing. It keeps your pillows looking better longer.

#### When to Replace Pillows

Even with regular cleaning, pillows do not last forever. Over time, they lose their support and shape. A good test: fold your pillow in half. If it does not spring back, it is time for a new one. Generally, replace pillows every 1 to 2 years. This ensures optimal support and hygiene. For more details on replacement, see [how often should you replace pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-replace-pillows). Regular replacement is vital for health.

### When Not to Wash Your Pillows in the Washer

While many pillows can go into the washer, some should not. Knowing these exceptions prevents damage. It also saves you from a potential laundry disaster. Always prioritize the pillow's care label.

#### Solid Memory Foam and Latex Pillows

As mentioned, solid memory foam and latex pillows should not be machine washed. The dense material absorbs too much water. This makes them extremely heavy. It can damage the washer motor. Water also breaks down their unique cell structure. This causes them to crumble or lose shape. Spot cleaning is the only safe option for these types.

#### Buckwheat or Microbead Pillows

Pillows filled with buckwheat hulls or microbeads are not designed for machine washing. Buckwheat hulls absorb water. They become very heavy and can mold if not dried perfectly. Microbeads can spill out if the pillow tears. This can clog your washer's drain system. These pillows usually have removable, washable covers. The inner filling part should not get wet.

#### Gel or Water-Filled Pillows

Any pillow with a gel or water core should never go into a washing machine. The core can burst. This will flood your machine and create a huge mess. These pillows are designed for surface cleaning only. Use a damp cloth to wipe them down. Always check for any external damage before cleaning these.

#### Pillows with Electronics or Heating Elements

Some specialty pillows include electronic components. These might be for massage, heat, or sound. Washing these pillows in a machine is extremely dangerous. It can cause electrical shorts. It can also damage the components permanently. Such pillows are typically spot clean only. Always follow the manufacturer's specific cleaning instructions carefully.

#### Compromised Pillows

If a pillow has large rips, exposed stuffing, or a very old, fragile fabric, do not machine wash it. The washing machine's agitation can worsen the damage. This can scatter the filling inside your machine. It is better to repair it first or consider replacing it. A damaged pillow may not survive the wash cycle anyway.

### Troubleshooting Common Pillow Washing Issues

Even when following guidelines, issues can arise. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps. This ensures your efforts to wash pillows in your washer are successful. Common problems include clumping and residual odors.

#### Dealing with Clumped Filling

If your pillow filling clumps after washing, it usually means it did not dry evenly. To fix this, put the pillow back in the dryer. Add a few dryer balls. Tumble dry on low heat. Pause frequently to fluff and break up clumps by hand. This process might take several cycles. Patience is key to restoring fluffiness.

#### Removing Lingering Odors

Sometimes, pillows retain a faint musty smell. This can happen if they were not completely dry. Airing them out in fresh air helps. You can also sprinkle baking soda generously over the pillow. Let it sit for several hours, then vacuum it off. For future washes, ensure thorough drying. Adding a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle can also neutralize odors.

#### Pillow Damage Prevention

To prevent damage, always check the care label. Use the gentle cycle. Avoid harsh detergents or bleach. Make sure the washer is not overloaded. Repair any small tears before washing. These steps minimize the risk of damage. They help your pillows last longer and stay intact.

#### Preventing Mold and Mildew

Mold and mildew thrive in damp environments. The best prevention is thorough drying. Ensure pillows are completely dry before putting them back on your bed. If you notice any mold spots, it is usually best to discard the pillow. Mold spores can be difficult to remove entirely. They pose health risks. Proper drying is the most important step for health.

#### When to Seek Professional Cleaning

For very delicate or expensive pillows, professional cleaning might be a better option. This includes some antique pillows or those with intricate designs. Professionals have specialized equipment and knowledge. They can clean pillows without risking damage. If you are unsure about washing a particular pillow, consult a professional cleaner. They can offer expert advice. This ensures your cherished pillows stay in good condition.
