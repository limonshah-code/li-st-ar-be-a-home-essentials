When your coffee machine stops dispensing water, it often indicates a blockage, an airlock, or a problem with the water pump or reservoir. Start by checking basic elements like water levels and proper reservoir placement. Then, move to descaling, cleaning filters, and addressing air trapped in the system.

## Basic Checks: Water Reservoir and Power Supply

When your coffee machine is not working, start with the easiest checks. Many water flow issues stem from simple oversights. These steps ensure your machine has the necessary basic conditions to operate. Skipping these quick checks can lead to unnecessary troubleshooting.

### Check the Water Reservoir

The water reservoir is the first place to look. Ensure it contains enough water. A low water level prevents the pump from drawing water. Refill the tank to its maximum line.

Next, check if the reservoir sits correctly in its slot. A misaligned or loose reservoir can break the seal. This prevents water from flowing into the machine's system. Remove the reservoir and reinsert it firmly. Listen for a click or feel it seat properly.

Some machines have a float valve inside the reservoir. This valve tells the machine if water is present. Make sure this float moves freely. A stuck float can trick the machine into thinking the tank is empty. Gently shake or tap the reservoir to free it.

### Ensure Proper Power Supply

Electrical issues can also stop water flow. Confirm your coffee machine is plugged into a live outlet. Check if the power cord is loose. A firm connection ensures the machine gets power.

Look at the power switch. Is it in the "on" position? Sometimes, a quick power cycle helps. Turn the machine off, unplug it for a minute, then plug it back in and turn it on. This can reset the internal system.

Check your circuit breaker. A tripped breaker can cut power to the outlet. Reset the breaker if it is off. These simple power checks eliminate common electrical causes. They ensure your machine has the power it needs to operate.

## The Silent Culprit: Clogs and Mineral Buildup

Mineral buildup, also known as limescale, is a common reason your **coffee machine water not coming through**. Hard water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. These minerals deposit inside the machine's heating elements and pipes over time. This buildup narrows water passages. Eventually, it can block them completely.

### Descaling Your Coffee Machine

Descaling is essential maintenance. It removes mineral deposits. You can buy commercial descaling solutions. Vinegar is also a natural option. Check your machine's manual for specific descaling instructions.

To descale:
1.  **Prepare the solution:** Mix the descaling agent with water according to instructions. For vinegar, mix equal parts white vinegar and water.
2.  **Fill reservoir:** Pour the solution into the water reservoir.
3.  **Run cycle:** Place a large container under the dispenser. Run a brewing cycle without coffee. Allow half the solution to pass through.
4.  **Pause and soak:** Turn off the machine. Let the remaining solution sit inside the machine for 20-30 minutes. This allows the descaler to break down stubborn buildup.
5.  **Complete cycle:** Turn the machine back on and let the rest of the solution run through.
6.  **Rinse:** Refill the reservoir with fresh water. Run two or three full cycles with only water. This flushes out any remaining descaling solution.

Regular descaling prevents future clogs. Most manufacturers recommend descaling every 1-3 months. This depends on your water hardness and usage. You can learn more about specific descaling methods, such as how to properly [clean your Breville coffee machine water filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-breville-coffee-machine-water-filter) which often involves descaling.

### Cleaning the Water Filter

Many modern coffee machines use a water filter. This filter removes impurities from the water. It also helps reduce mineral buildup. However, a clogged water filter can restrict water flow. This prevents water from reaching the brewing system.

Your machine's filter might be inside the water reservoir. Inspect it for visible dirt or discoloration. A dirty filter needs replacement. Most filters last about 2-3 months. The manufacturer's manual provides replacement schedules.

To clean or replace:
1.  **Locate filter:** Find the filter, usually in the water tank.
2.  **Remove filter:** Take out the old filter according to the manual.
3.  **Clean filter housing:** Wipe the area where the filter sits.
4.  **Insert new filter:** Place a new filter firmly into position.
5.  **Prime new filter:** Some new filters require priming. Submerge them in water briefly before installation.

Regularly changing your water filter helps maintain water flow. It also improves coffee taste. Neglecting the filter is a common reason for water issues. You can find general tips on [how to clean a coffee filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-coffee-filter) effectively to ensure optimal performance.

## Addressing Clogged Brew Group and Spray Heads

Even after descaling and checking the filter, water might still not come through. The problem could lie closer to where the coffee brews. The brew group and spray head are critical components. They deliver water directly to the coffee grounds. Blockages here can severely impact water flow.

### Inspecting the Brew Group

The brew group is where coffee is made. It consists of several parts that move and seal. Old coffee grounds or oils can accumulate here. This sticky residue can restrict water pathways. If your machine has a removable brew group, take it out.

Most brew groups detach easily. Consult your machine's manual for removal instructions. Once removed, rinse it under warm water. Use a soft brush to scrub away any visible debris. Pay attention to small openings and crevices. Ensure all moving parts operate smoothly.

Some fixed brew groups require specific cleaning cycles. Follow the manufacturer's advice. Running a cleaning tablet cycle can help dissolve stubborn blockages. This helps maintain clean internal parts. Regular cleaning of the brew group ensures proper water flow and better coffee taste.

### Clearing the Spray Head

The spray head, also called the shower screen, is at the top of the brew chamber. Water comes through this part to saturate the coffee grounds. Tiny holes in the spray head can become clogged. Coffee oils and fine grounds are often the culprits. These blockages prevent water from evenly dispersing.

To clean the spray head:
1.  **Locate:** Identify the spray head. It is usually above where the coffee grounds sit.
2.  **Remove:** Some spray heads unscrew. Others are fixed. If removable, take it off.
3.  **Clean:** Use a small brush or toothpick to clear each hole. Soak the spray head in warm, soapy water. A descaling solution can also help dissolve oil buildup.
4.  **Rinse and Reattach:** Rinse thoroughly and reattach.

If the spray head is not removable, use a small, stiff brush to clean its surface. Run a cycle with only water to flush it. A clogged spray head is a frequent cause of poor water distribution. It also leads to weak or unevenly brewed coffee. Cleaning this component is a quick fix. Regular attention prevents future clogs.

## Water Pump and Airlock Issues

After addressing clogs, if your **coffee machine water not coming through** remains a problem, the issue might be with the machine's internal mechanics. The water pump is essential for moving water. An airlock can also halt water flow. These problems often require specific troubleshooting.

### Resetting for an Airlock

An airlock occurs when air becomes trapped in the water lines. This trapped air prevents the pump from drawing water. It acts as a barrier. Airlocks are common after refilling an empty reservoir or after the machine has been off for a long time.

To clear an airlock:
1.  **Run Hot Water Function:** If your machine has a hot water dispenser, try running it. This can often push the air through the system.
2.  **Run Steam Function:** For espresso machines with a steam wand, activate the steam function. The high pressure can force trapped air out. Run it until a steady stream of steam or water appears.
3.  **Prime the Pump Manually:** Some machines have a specific priming procedure. Check your manual. Often, it involves filling the reservoir and running a cycle while gently tilting the machine. This can help dislodge air bubbles.
4.  **Repeat Cycles:** Sometimes, running a few short brewing cycles with water can help dislodge the air. Be patient; it might take a few tries.

Clearing an airlock often restores water flow immediately. It is a common, yet often overlooked, solution.

### Understanding Pump Failure

The water pump creates the pressure needed to push water through the machine. If the pump fails, water will not move. Signs of a failing pump include:
*   **No sound:** The pump makes no operating sound when you try to brew.
*   **Weak sound:** The pump sounds weak or struggles.
*   **No water movement:** Even with a full reservoir and clear lines, water does not dispense.

Pump failure can result from:
*   **Overheating:** Prolonged use or blockages can cause the pump to overheat.
*   **Wear and Tear:** Pumps wear out over time.
*   **Electrical issues:** A faulty connection or motor can cause failure.
