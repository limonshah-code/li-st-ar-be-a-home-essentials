    *   Look up solutions for minor cooling problems.
    *   Knowing [how to turn your LG refrigerator on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-lg-refrigerator-on) correctly after a power outage can prevent damage.

Also, avoid overfilling your refrigerator. Air needs to circulate freely for efficient cooling. Leave some space between items. Finally, if you notice any unusual noises or performance changes, investigate them quickly. Early detection of problems can prevent larger repairs. Following these simple maintenance tips will help your LG refrigerator stay reliable for many years.
