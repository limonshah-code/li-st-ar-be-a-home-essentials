### Clear the Path and Remove Bedding

Before the delivery team arrives, make sure the path is clear. Remove any obstacles from the bedroom to the exit. Clear hallways, stairwells, and doorways. This prevents damage to your home and injury to the movers. It allows for quick and efficient removal.

Strip your old mattress completely. Take off all sheets, blankets, and pillowcases. Also, remove any mattress pads or toppers. The haul away service only takes the bare mattress.

Consider donating or properly disposing of old pillows, similar to how you might [throw away pillows](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-throw-away-pillows) separately.

### Securing and Protecting the Mattress

Some haul away services suggest or require you to bag your mattress. Using a large plastic mattress bag can be helpful. These bags protect your home from dust or allergens from the old mattress. They also keep the mattress contained during transport. You can buy these bags online or at moving supply stores.

If your mattress is very old or damaged, bagging it is a good idea. This prevents any debris from falling off. It also makes the process more sanitary for the movers.
