Sheepskin rugs are synonymous with warmth and softness. They are instantly recognizable by their thick, plush wool. These rugs bring an unparalleled level of comfort to any space. People often use them to create cozy nooks. They are perfect for draping over chairs or placing next to a bed.

### Reindeer Hides: Unique Nordic Charm

Reindeer hides offer a distinct alternative to other animal skin rugs. They are most common in Nordic and rustic decor themes. Reindeer hair is hollow, providing excellent insulation.

Spot clean only with a damp cloth and mild soap. Proper care ensures the hide retains its beauty and warmth for years.
