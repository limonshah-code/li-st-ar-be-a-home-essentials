### How do you remove an LG microwave from a wall?

To remove an LG microwave from a wall, first disconnect its power supply. Then, locate and remove the two bolts securing the microwave to the upper cabinet. Have a helper support the unit. Carefully lift the microwave off its wall mounting plate. Finally, disengage any ventilation ductwork and pull the unit away from the wall.

## Preparing for LG Microwave Removal

Before you begin to remove an LG microwave from the wall, prepare your workspace. Preparation makes the job easier and safer. First, gather all necessary tools. You will need a stepladder, screwdrivers, and a voltage tester. A drill with appropriate bits may also be helpful. Safety glasses and work gloves protect you during the process.

Next, clear the area around the microwave. Remove all items from your stovetop below the microwave. Clear any items from countertops nearby. This prevents damage and provides ample space. You might need a sturdy surface to place the microwave on after removal. Consider covering your range or countertop with a moving blanket or cardboard. This protects surfaces from scratches or dents. I find this simple step saves a lot of headaches later.

### Essential Tools and Materials

Having the right tools ready is very important. This helps the removal go smoothly. Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Screwdrivers:** You will likely need both Phillips-head and flat-head screwdrivers. These remove various screws on the microwave and cabinet.
*   **Power Drill (optional):** A drill with a Phillips bit speeds up screw removal. Be careful not to strip screws.
*   **Adjustable Wrench or Socket Set:** These tools remove the bolts that secure the microwave to the upper cabinet.
*   **Voltage Tester:** This is crucial for verifying that the power is off. Never skip this step.
*   **Stepladder:** Essential for reaching the top of the microwave and cabinet. Choose a stable, secure ladder.
*   **Work Gloves:** Protect your hands from sharp edges or grime.
*   **Safety Glasses:** Protect your eyes from falling debris or dust.
*   **Duct Tape or Painter's Tape:** Useful for securing wires or marking positions.
*   **Cardboard or Moving Blanket:** Place these on your stovetop or countertop to protect them.
*   **Marker or Pencil:** Mark the bracket location if you plan to install a new microwave.

Gathering everything before you start saves time. It prevents interruptions during the removal process. This preparation step sets you up for a successful removal.

### Safety Measures: Prioritizing Your Well-being

Safety is the most important part of any appliance removal. Electricity can cause serious harm. Always prioritize safety first. Begin by turning off the power to the microwave. Go to your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker that controls your kitchen outlets or the microwave specifically. Flip it to the "off" position. Label it if you can, to prevent accidental re-engagement.

After turning off the breaker, use a voltage tester. Touch the probes of the tester to the outlet where the microwave plugs in. If it is hardwired, test the wires at the junction box. The tester should show no power. This confirms the circuit is dead. Do not proceed until you confirm no power is present. Never assume the power is off without testing.

It is also wise to have a second person assist you. Microwaves are heavy and awkward. Lifting one alone can lead to injury or damage to the unit. Your helper can support the microwave as you remove fasteners. They can also help guide it down from the wall. Communication with your helper is key for a smooth lift. We focus on safe, effective removal.

## Disconnecting Power and Ventilation for LG Microwave

Once your workspace is ready and safety measures are in place, focus on the connections. Your LG microwave has two main connections: electrical power and ventilation. Both must be disconnected properly before removal. This step ensures safety and prevents damage. Take your time to understand how your specific model is connected.

The electrical connection is usually a standard three-prong plug. It plugs into an outlet in the cabinet above the microwave. Sometimes, it is hardwired into a junction box. For hardwired units, you will need to open the junction box cover. Carefully disconnect the wires. Remember to test for power again even if you think it is off.

Ventilation connections vary. Your LG microwave might vent directly into the room, outside through a wall, or up through a cabinet and roof. Identify your specific setup. Disconnecting the vent might involve removing screws from a duct cover. It might require carefully separating the ductwork from the microwave's exhaust port.

### Unplugging the Microwave

Most over-the-range LG microwaves plug into an outlet. This outlet is typically inside the cabinet directly above the microwave. Accessing this plug is usually the first electrical step. Open the cabinet doors above the microwave. Look for an electrical outlet with the microwave's cord plugged into it.

Once you have located it, simply unplug the cord. Give it a firm, steady pull. Do not yank the cord. This prevents damage to the outlet or the cord itself. Sometimes, the cord might be secured with a tie or clip to the cabinet wall. Remove any such fasteners before unplugging.

If your LG microwave is hardwired, the process is different. You will find a metal or plastic junction box. This box is usually inside the upper cabinet or behind the microwave. Carefully remove the cover of this box. Inside, you will see electrical wires connected with wire nuts. These are often black, white, and green (or bare copper) wires. Use your voltage tester on these wires. Confirm no power before touching them. Then, carefully twist off the wire nuts. Separate the microwave's wires from your home's electrical wiring. Be sure to note which wires connect to which. You might want to take a picture for reinstallation guidance.

### Detaching the Ventilation System

LG over-the-range microwaves include a ventilation fan. This fan pulls air from your stovetop. This air can vent in a few ways. Some models vent directly back into the kitchen through a grille at the top front of the microwave. In this case, there is no ductwork to disconnect.

Other models vent outside. They use a rectangular metal duct. This duct usually goes up through the cabinet above the microwave. It then connects to external venting. You will need to access the ductwork inside the upper cabinet. Look for screws that secure the microwave's exhaust port to the duct. Remove these screws carefully. The duct might be sealed with tape or caulk. You might need to cut through these seals. Once disconnected, the ductwork will stay in place. The microwave can then be pulled away.

Some microwaves might vent directly through the exterior wall. For these units, the duct runs horizontally. It goes from the back of the microwave to an outside vent cover. You will likely disconnect the duct at the back of the microwave. This involves similar steps to the vertical duct. Ensure all connections are free. This allows the microwave to move freely from the wall. Proper disconnection prevents damage to your ventilation system.

## Locating and Removing Mounting Fasteners

Your LG microwave is secured to the wall and the upper cabinet. It uses specific fasteners for stability. Understanding where these fasteners are located is crucial for safe removal. There are usually two main attachment points. The first is at the top, securing the microwave to the cabinet above. The second is a wall mounting plate or bracket, which supports the bottom and back of the microwave.

Locating these fasteners requires a good light source and perhaps a measuring tape. The top bolts are typically visible when you open the cabinet doors. The wall plate is usually hidden behind the microwave itself. Knowing their positions helps you plan your next steps. Do not try to force the microwave before all fasteners are free. This can cause damage to your appliance or your cabinets.

You might find that different models have slightly varied fastener locations. Always consult your LG microwave's owner's manual if you have it. The manual often includes detailed diagrams. These diagrams show all mounting points. If you do not have the manual, look for common attachment points. Most over-the-range microwaves use a similar installation method.

### Upper Cabinet Bolts

Most LG over-the-range microwaves are secured by two large bolts. These bolts extend down from the bottom of the upper cabinet. They screw directly into the top of the microwave unit. To access these bolts, open the cabinet doors directly above the microwave. Look for two large holes on the bottom shelf of the cabinet. These holes usually have decorative caps covering the bolts.

Use a Phillips-head screwdriver or a socket wrench to remove these bolts. Turn them counter-clockwise. They might be quite long. Continue turning until they are completely free. Make sure you remove both bolts. If only one is removed, the microwave will still be partially secured. This could make it dangerously unstable during removal.

Sometimes, the bolts might be tight or rusted. Apply steady pressure. If they resist, a bit of penetrating oil can help. Be careful not to strip the bolt heads. Stripped bolts make removal much harder. If a bolt head strips, you might need to use a bolt extractor. I always suggest using the correct size tool to avoid stripping. Removing these top bolts is a critical step. It allows the microwave to separate from the cabinet structure.

### Wall Mounting Plate (Bracket)

The lower portion of your LG microwave rests on a metal wall mounting plate. This plate is often called a bracket. This bracket is securely screwed into the wall studs behind the microwave. You cannot access these screws directly while the microwave is in place. The microwave itself covers them.

The microwave hooks onto this bracket. It has small lips or tabs on its back bottom edge. These tabs slide into slots or over the edge of the mounting plate. To disengage the microwave from the bracket, you typically need to lift the front of the microwave slightly. Then, pull the unit forward and away from the wall. This action unhooks the tabs from the bracket.

Ensure both upper bolts are fully removed before attempting to lift. If the microwave does not lift easily, check for any remaining fasteners. Sometimes, there might be a small screw or two along the bottom edge of the microwave. These screws go into the wall or a hidden bracket. Such screws are less common for over-the-range models. But they are worth checking for if the unit feels stuck. Once the microwave is off the bracket, the bracket itself stays on the wall. You can remove it later if you do not plan to install a new microwave.

## Supporting and Lowering the LG Microwave

Once all fasteners and connections are free, the heavy lifting begins. This is where having a helper is absolutely essential. An over-the-range LG microwave can weigh between 50 and 80 pounds. It is also bulky and difficult to grip. Trying to lower it alone risks injury to yourself and damage to your kitchen.

Your helper needs to be strong enough to manage this weight. They should stand ready to support the microwave's weight as you perform the final detachment. Communication is key during this phase. Talk through each movement with your helper. Plan exactly how you will lift, pull, and lower the unit. Agree on a signal to ensure you both lift at the same time.

Before you begin, ensure you have a clear path to the floor. Have a designated spot for the microwave. This could be your protected stovetop or a cleared area on the floor. I prefer placing it on the stovetop first. It is usually closer and provides a flat surface.

### Lifting and Pulling Forward

With your helper in position, stand on your stepladder. Position yourself in front of the microwave. Your helper should also be ready to support the unit from below. The next step is to lift the front of the microwave slightly. This action unhooks the microwave from its wall mounting bracket.

Apply a gentle upward force to the front of the microwave. You might hear a slight click as the tabs disengage. Once disengaged, the microwave will still be resting on the wall bracket. It will feel much lighter as its weight is no longer being pulled down by the upper cabinet bolts.

Next, carefully pull the microwave straight forward. Pull it away from the wall. This action slides the unit off the wall mounting bracket. Your helper must be ready to take the full weight of the microwave as it comes off the bracket. If you pull too quickly, the microwave could fall. Maintain a slow, controlled movement. This ensures safety for both you and the appliance. Remember, these are heavy appliances.

### Lowering the Unit Safely

Once the LG microwave is pulled clear of the wall mounting bracket, it is completely free. At this point, you and your helper are supporting its entire weight. This is the most critical moment of the removal process. Do not rush this step.

Carefully begin to lower the microwave. Coordinate with your helper to lower it slowly and evenly. Keep your backs straight. Lift with your legs, not your back. Take small steps if you need to reposition. Guide the microwave down onto your prepared surface. This might be your stovetop or a sturdy countertop.

Once the microwave is resting safely, you can take a moment to rest. Double-check its stability on the surface. Ensure it will not tip over. Now you can move the microwave to its final destination. This could be outdoors, into another room, or ready for disposal. Congratulations, you have successfully removed your LG microwave from the wall! The physical removal is the hardest part.

## Addressing the Mounting Bracket and Wall

After you remove the LG microwave, you will see the wall mounting bracket. This metal plate remains attached to the wall. You also see the exposed wall area. This area might show old screw holes, paint marks, or grime. Decide what to do with the bracket and the wall. Your plans depend on what you will do next.

If you are installing a new over-the-range microwave, you might reuse the existing bracket. Check if your new microwave is compatible with the old bracket. Many brands use a similar design. However, some manufacturers use unique bracket designs. It is best to check the new microwave's instructions. If the new microwave comes with its own bracket, you should use it.

If you are not replacing the microwave, you will want to remove the old bracket. You might also want to repair and repaint the wall. This gives your kitchen a fresh, clean look. This part of the process cleans up the area. It prepares it for its next use.

### Removing the Old Mounting Plate

To remove the old LG microwave mounting plate, you will need your drill or screwdriver. The plate is usually secured with several screws. These screws go into wall studs for strong support. Locate all the screws holding the bracket to the wall. They are typically spaced along the top and bottom edges of the plate.

Use the appropriate screwdriver bit or tip. Carefully unscrew each screw. Keep the screws together if you might reuse them. Once all screws are removed, the bracket should lift away from the wall easily. If it resists, double-check for any missed screws. Sometimes, the plate might be stuck due to old paint or grime. A gentle pry with a flat-head screwdriver might help.

After removing the bracket, you will see the holes left by the screws. You will also see the outline of the bracket. This area of the wall might be dirty or discolored. It might also have damage from previous installations. Plan to clean and repair this section of the wall. This prepares the area for whatever comes next.

### Wall Repair and Preparation

With the microwave and bracket gone, your wall is exposed. This is a good time for repairs and cleaning. Start by cleaning the wall surface. Use a mild all-purpose cleaner to remove grease and grime. Pay special attention to the area where the microwave used to be. Old splatters and dust build up.

Next, address any holes in the wall. Use spackle or wall putty to fill the screw holes. Apply the putty with a putty knife. Smooth it out flush with the wall surface. Let the spackle dry completely. Drying time varies. Check the product instructions. Once dry, lightly sand the patched areas. This creates a smooth surface.

Finally, prime and paint the wall. Use a primer specifically designed for patched walls. This ensures a uniform finish. Then, apply paint that matches your existing kitchen walls. If you do not have matching paint, consider painting the entire wall section. This creates a seamless look. A fresh coat of paint brightens the kitchen. It removes any traces of the old microwave. This step completes the wall transformation.

## Disposing of Your Old LG Microwave

After successfully removing your LG microwave, you face a new task: disposal. Microwaves contain various materials. These include metal, plastic, and electronic components. Proper disposal is important. It protects the environment. It also ensures safety. You cannot simply throw a microwave into your regular trash. Many areas have specific rules for appliance disposal.

Check your local municipality's waste management guidelines. Many cities offer special pickup days for large appliances or electronic waste. Some have designated drop-off centers. These centers collect appliances for recycling. Recycling ensures that valuable materials are recovered. It also keeps hazardous materials out of landfills.

Consider the condition of your old microwave. If it is still in working order, even with minor issues, it might have value. Someone else might be able to use it. If it is completely broken, recycling is the best option. Do not abandon an old microwave. Responsible disposal is part of being a good homeowner.
