## Does Your LG Dishwasher Include a Water Supply Line?

Buying a new appliance for your home is always exciting. You might be upgrading an old model or installing a dishwasher for the first time. As you unbox your new LG dishwasher, a common question often comes to mind: "Does LG dishwasher come with water supply line?" This is a crucial detail for installation. I know the feeling of opening a new appliance box, ready to set it up, only to find a key component missing.

This article answers that important question directly. We will explore what typically comes in an LG dishwasher box. We will also discuss why water supply lines are often sold separately. Understanding this helps you prepare for a smooth installation. We cover the different types of supply lines. You will also learn what other components you need for a complete setup. I want to help you avoid surprises during your installation process.

### Takeaway

*   LG dishwashers generally **do not include a water supply line**.
*   You will need to purchase a **separate supply line**.
*   Choose a **braided stainless steel hose** for durability.
*   Ensure the line has the **correct fittings** (3/8" compression to 3/4" FHT).
*   Always **check local plumbing codes** before installation.

A new LG dishwasher typically does not include a water supply line in the box. Manufacturers usually expect you to purchase this component separately. This allows you to select a line that matches your home's specific plumbing connections and desired length. You will need to buy a water supply hose before you install your new appliance.

## What's Inside the Standard LG Dishwasher Package?

When you unbox a new LG dishwasher, you will find several key components. Manufacturers include essential items for basic operation. These items help get your dishwasher running quickly. However, some crucial parts are not always included.

Typically, an LG dishwasher package contains the dishwasher unit itself. You will also find an owner's manual. This manual has important information about operating and maintaining your appliance. It often includes installation instructions too. Look for the included drain hose. This hose connects your dishwasher to your home's drainage system. It is vital for removing dirty water after a wash cycle.

The power cord is another standard inclusion. This cord connects your dishwasher to an electrical outlet. Sometimes, it might be a direct wire connection, depending on the model. You might also find a user guide or quick start guide. This helps you get familiar with the dishwasher's features. Installation brackets are usually in the box too. These brackets secure the dishwasher to your countertop. They prevent the appliance from tipping.

What you generally will not find is the water supply line. This line brings fresh water into the dishwasher. It is a critical component for the appliance to function. Manufacturers often omit this part. This allows for flexibility in installation. Home plumbing setups vary greatly. A single standard water supply line would not fit every home. So, you must buy this separately. This ensures you get the right length and connection type for your specific needs. Understanding these inclusions and exclusions prevents surprises during installation.

## Why Water Supply Lines Are Often Separate

You might wonder why a necessary component like a water supply line is not included with your new LG dishwasher. There are several good reasons for this. Manufacturers make this choice to accommodate various home setups. It also ensures safety and compliance with different building codes.

Firstly, homes have different plumbing configurations. Water supply connections can vary in location relative to the dishwasher. This means different lengths of supply lines are needed. A line that is too short will not reach. A line that is too long can create kinks or hazards. It also wastes space behind the appliance. By not including a line, you can buy the exact length you need. This makes for a cleaner and safer installation.

Secondly, connection types can differ. Some homes might use copper piping. Others might have flexible braided lines already installed. The type of fitting on your home's water valve can also vary. A universal supply line might not fit every valve perfectly. Allowing you to choose ensures compatibility. You can select a line with the correct end fittings for your specific plumbing. This helps create a secure and leak-free connection. An improper fit can lead to leaks, which can damage your home.

Thirdly, local building codes and regulations vary by region. Some areas might require specific types of water supply lines. For instance, some codes may mandate braided stainless steel lines over rubber ones for durability and flood prevention. Including one specific type of line might violate codes in certain areas. Manufacturers avoid this issue by letting the consumer choose a compliant line. This puts the responsibility on the installer to meet local requirements. This ensures the installation is safe and up to code. If your LG dishwasher is not filling with water, it could be due to an improperly connected or kinked water supply line. Check out [why is my lg dishwasher not filling with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dishwasher-not-filling-with-water) for troubleshooting tips.

Finally, materials and quality can differ. Consumers can choose a higher quality or more durable supply line if they wish. A standard, low-cost line might be included otherwise. Offering the line separately gives you control over the quality. Many people prefer braided stainless steel lines for their strength and longevity. These reasons combine to make selling the water supply line separately a practical choice for both manufacturers and consumers.

## Types of Dishwasher Water Supply Lines

When it comes to purchasing a water supply line for your LG dishwasher, you will find a few common types. Each type has its own characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Knowing these differences helps you make an informed choice for your home. You want a line that is durable and provides a secure connection.

The most popular choice today is the **braided stainless steel water supply line**. These lines have an inner rubber or PVC hose. An outer layer of woven stainless steel wire protects this inner hose. The steel braiding makes the line extremely durable and resistant to kinking. It also helps prevent bursting under pressure. This makes them a very reliable option for dishwashers. I personally recommend these for their longevity and peace of mind. They are flexible, which helps during installation in tight spaces. They also tend to last longer than older rubber hoses.

Another option is the **copper water supply line**. These lines are made from solid copper tubing. Copper is very durable and long-lasting. It resists corrosion well. However, copper lines are less flexible than braided hoses. This can make installation more challenging, especially in confined areas. They require special tools for bending and flaring connections. This often means a professional installer is needed. Copper lines are generally more expensive too. They are less common for new dishwasher installations today compared to braided lines.

Older installations might still use **reinforced rubber hoses**. These hoses are typically thicker and less flexible than braided lines. They are also more prone to kinking and cracking over time. Rubber can degrade, especially if exposed to harsh chemicals or high temperatures. This increases the risk of leaks or bursts. I generally advise against using old rubber hoses for a new installation. Always replace them with a new, high-quality line. For other LG appliances, the hot water supply is also a common consideration. See [does lg washing machine need hot water supply](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-lg-washing-machine-need-hot-water-supply) for more information on washing machine water connections.

When choosing a line, look for certifications like UPC (Uniform Plumbing Code) or IAPMO (International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials). These certifications ensure the product meets industry safety and quality standards. Always select a line that is specifically designed for dishwashers. This ensures it can handle the water pressure and temperature. Choosing the right type of water supply line is essential for a safe and leak-free dishwasher operation.

## What You Need for LG Dishwasher Installation

Installing an LG dishwasher involves more than just plugging it in. You need several key components to ensure it functions properly and safely. Understanding these requirements beforehand will make your installation process much smoother. I always make a checklist before starting any appliance installation project.

First and foremost, you will need the **water supply line**. As we discussed, this typically does not come with the dishwasher. You need a specific type of hose that connects your home's water shut-off valve to the dishwasher's water inlet. Most dishwashers require a 3/8-inch compression fitting on one end and a 3/4-inch female hose thread (FHT) fitting on the other. Always choose a braided stainless steel line for durability and safety.

Next, you need a **shut-off valve** for the water supply. This valve allows you to turn off the water to the dishwasher without affecting the rest of your home's water supply. It is a critical safety feature. If you do not have an existing shut-off valve under your sink, you will need to install one. This might involve some basic plumbing work.

The **electrical connection** is another vital part. LG dishwashers usually come with a power cord or are designed for direct wiring. If it's a direct wire model, you might need a junction box and wire connectors. Ensure your electrical circuit can handle the dishwasher's power requirements. Always follow electrical safety guidelines or hire a qualified electrician.

You will also need a **drain connection**. LG dishwashers include a drain hose. This hose needs to connect to your home's drainage system. This is usually done through an air gap on the sink or directly into the garbage disposal or a dedicated drain line. An air gap prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Check local codes, as some areas require an air gap. If your LG dishwasher has water in the bottom, a clogged or improperly installed drain line could be the cause. Find more details at [why does my lg dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom).

Finally, you will need **basic tools**. These include wrenches for tightening fittings, screwdrivers, a drill, and possibly a level. Some models might require specific mounting brackets or screws, which are usually included. Before starting, always read your LG dishwasher's installation manual carefully. It provides model-specific instructions and a detailed list of required parts and tools. Being prepared with all these components ensures a successful and safe installation.

## Choosing the Right Water Supply Line for Your LG

Selecting the correct water supply line for your new LG dishwasher is a critical step. An improper line can lead to leaks, water damage, or even a flood. I always emphasize getting the right parts for any home appliance. Here are the key factors to consider.

First, consider the **length** of the supply line. Measure the distance from your home's water shut-off valve to the dishwasher's inlet connection. You want a line that is long enough to reach comfortably without being taut. However, do not get one that is excessively long. Too much slack can create kinks or make it difficult to push the dishwasher back into place. A length of 6 to 10 feet is common, but measure your specific setup.

Next, focus on the **fitting size**. Most dishwashers, including LG models, require a 3/8-inch compression fitting on the end that connects to your home's water supply valve. The other end, which connects to the dishwasher itself, typically needs a 3/4-inch female hose thread (FHT) fitting. Double-check your dishwasher's manual to confirm these sizes. Using the wrong size fittings will prevent a secure, leak-free connection.

The **material** of the supply line is also important. As discussed earlier, braided stainless steel is the preferred choice. It offers superior durability, flexibility, and resistance to kinking and bursting compared to rubber or plastic lines. Copper lines are also durable but are less flexible and harder to install for DIYers. Always choose a new, high-quality line rather than reusing an old one. Old lines can degrade over time and fail.

Check for **certifications**. Look for supply lines that are certified by reputable organizations such as the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC), International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), or NSF International. These certifications mean the product has met strict standards for safety, performance, and material quality. They give you confidence in the line's reliability.

Lastly, consider any **additional features**. Some supply lines come with an integrated shut-off valve or a specialized elbow fitting. These can simplify the installation process. However, ensure they are compatible with your existing setup and that the quality is high. Investing in a good quality water supply line is a small cost compared to the potential damage from a water leak. Ensure you know how to handle water lines, just like you would if you were dealing with a refrigerator water line, as seen in [how to remove lg refrigerator door with water line](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-lg-refrigerator-door-with-water-line).

## DIY vs. Professional Dishwasher Installation

When it comes to installing your new LG dishwasher, you have two main options: doing it yourself (DIY) or hiring a professional. Both approaches have their pros and cons. I often weigh these factors carefully before deciding on a home project. Your choice depends on your skill level, comfort with plumbing and electrical work, and local regulations.

**DIY Installation:**
If you are comfortable with basic plumbing and electrical tasks, installing a dishwasher yourself can save money. Many homeowners successfully install their own dishwashers. The process involves connecting the water supply line, the drain hose, and the electrical power. You also need to secure the unit to the cabinetry. Modern dishwashers often come with clear, step-by-step installation manuals. These guides are designed to help a capable DIYer. I find a sense of accomplishment in completing these tasks myself. However, a small mistake can lead to big problems. Water leaks can cause significant damage to your floors and cabinets. Improper electrical connections can be a fire hazard.

**Professional Installation:**
Hiring a professional plumber or appliance installer is often the safer choice. Professionals have the experience and tools to ensure the job is done correctly. They are familiar with local building codes. This means your installation will meet all safety and legal requirements. A professional can quickly identify and resolve any unexpected issues. They can handle complex plumbing or electrical adjustments if needed. While it costs more upfront, it can save you from costly repairs down the line. Many appliance retailers offer installation services when you purchase the dishwasher. This is a convenient option. They often guarantee their work. If your dishwasher has water in the bottom, a professional installation can help avoid such issues. Consider [why does my lg dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) for related troubleshooting.

**When to Consider a Professional:**
*   **No existing connections:** If you are installing a dishwasher where there was not one before, you might need new water lines, drain lines, or electrical outlets. This work is best left to a professional.
*   **Complex plumbing:** If your existing plumbing is old, corroded, or looks complicated, a professional can assess and safely handle it.
*   **Electrical concerns:** If you are unsure about wiring or circuit capacity, always call an electrician.
*   **Time constraints:** If you need the dishwasher installed quickly and do not have the time, a professional can get it done efficiently.
*   **Warranty implications:** Some manufacturers might have specific installation requirements for warranty validity. A professional can ensure these are met.

Ultimately, safety and peace of mind are paramount. If you have any doubts about your ability to perform the installation safely and correctly, hire a professional. It is an investment in your home's safety and the longevity of your new LG dishwasher.

## Troubleshooting Water Supply Issues with Your LG Dishwasher

Even after a proper installation, you might sometimes encounter issues with your LG dishwasher's water supply. These problems can prevent the dishwasher from filling, cleaning properly, or even starting a cycle. I have learned that a systematic approach helps resolve most issues.

One common problem is the dishwasher not filling with water at all. First, check the **water shut-off valve**. Ensure it is fully open. Sometimes, it might be partially closed, restricting water flow. Next, inspect the **water supply line** itself. Look for any kinks or bends in the hose. A kinked hose will prevent water from reaching the dishwasher. Also, check if the mesh filter at the dishwasher's inlet connection is clogged. Mineral deposits or debris can block water flow. You can usually unscrew the supply line from the dishwasher to check and clean this filter. If your LG dishwasher is not filling with water, these steps are a good starting point. You can find more comprehensive solutions at [why is my lg dishwasher not filling with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dishwasher-not-filling-with-water).

Another issue could be **low water pressure**. If your dishwasher takes a very long time to fill, or the wash cycle seems inefficient, low water pressure might be the cause. You can test your home's water pressure by turning on a faucet nearby. If the flow is weak there too, the problem might be with your home's main water supply, not just the dishwasher. Check your main water shut-off valve, ensure it is fully open, and confirm there are no widespread plumbing issues in your home. Sometimes, an old or partially corroded supply line can also restrict flow.

**Leaks** are a serious concern. If you notice water pooling under your LG dishwasher, turn off the water supply immediately. Then, try to identify the source of the leak. Common leak points include the connections at the water shut-off valve, the dishwasher's inlet valve, or within the supply line itself if it is damaged. Ensure all fittings are tight but not overtightened, which can strip threads. If the supply line is old or shows signs of wear, replace it immediately. Small drips can turn into major floods quickly. If you are dealing with other appliance water line issues, such as a frozen refrigerator line, solutions often involve similar steps of checking connections and ensuring clear flow, as discussed in [why does my frigidaire refrigerator water line keep freezing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-refrigerator-water-line-keep-freezing).

If after checking these points, the issue persists, it might indicate a problem with the dishwasher's internal components, such as the inlet valve. In such cases, it is best to consult your LG owner's manual or contact LG customer support for professional assistance.
