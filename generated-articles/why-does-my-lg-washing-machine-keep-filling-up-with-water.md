### Clear Answer to the Main Query

Your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water often due to a faulty water inlet valve that fails to close properly, a malfunctioning pressure sensor not detecting the correct water level, or an incorrectly installed drain hose creating a siphon effect. These issues cause the washer to continuously draw or retain water.

### Why Your LG Washing Machine Keeps Filling Up: An Overview

It is certainly confusing when your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water. This issue can seem mysterious, but several common causes explain it. Understanding these reasons is the first step toward finding a solution. You might notice water collecting even when the washer is off, or the cycle seems to never end because it just keeps adding water.

One major reason is a problem with the water inlet valve. This valve controls the flow of water into the tub. If it fails to close completely, water will continue to trickle in. Another frequent culprit is the pressure sensor or its air trap hose. The pressure sensor tells your washer how much water is inside. If it gives a wrong reading, the machine might think it needs more water and keep filling.

Sometimes, the problem is simpler, related to the drain hose setup. An improperly installed drain hose can create a siphon effect, pulling water back into the tub from your drain standpipe or sink. Less common but still possible, a faulty main control board can send incorrect signals, causing the machine to overfill. I will guide you through checking each of these potential issues. Diagnosing the problem accurately helps you decide whether you can fix it yourself or need professional help. Knowing the cause saves time and effort. It also prevents potential water damage in your laundry area.

### Diagnosing a Faulty Water Inlet Valve in Your LG Washer

The water inlet valve is a critical part of your LG washing machine's water system. If your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water, this valve is often the primary suspect. This valve has solenoids that open and close, allowing water into the tub. If one of these solenoids sticks open, or the valve itself fails, water will continually seep into the washer, even when the machine is turned off or between cycles. I have seen this issue many times, and it is a common reason for overfilling.

You can often test this valve by observing your washer. Unplug the washing machine from power and shut off the water supply. After about 30 minutes, open the washer door. If you still see water accumulating inside the tub, it strongly suggests the inlet valve is leaking. Even a slow drip will eventually fill the tub. This test is simple and helps confirm if the valve is failing to seal properly.

Replacing a water inlet valve is a common DIY repair. First, you must disconnect the washer from its power source and turn off both hot and cold water supply lines. Then, carefully disconnect the water hoses from the back of the washer. You will need to access the valve, which is usually located where the water hoses connect to the machine's back panel. Remove the screws securing the panel and the valve. Disconnect the electrical connectors and hose clamps from the old valve. Install the new valve, ensuring all connections are secure. Remember to check for leaks after turning the water back on and before plugging in the machine. Taking care during this process ensures a safe and effective repair.

### Understanding and Fixing LG Washing Machine Pressure Sensor Issues

Another major reason your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water is a problem with the pressure sensor or its connecting hose. The pressure sensor is essential for accurate water level detection. It works by measuring the air pressure in a small hose connected to the bottom of the wash tub. As water fills the tub, it compresses the air in this hose. The sensor reads this pressure change and signals the control board when the desired water level is reached. If this system malfunctions, the washer will not know when to stop filling.

A common issue is a clogged or kinked air trap hose leading to the pressure sensor. Soap residue, lint, or mineral deposits can build up inside this hose, blocking the airflow. This blockage prevents the sensor from accurately sensing the water level. The washer then believes there isn't enough water and continues to fill. To check this, you will need to access the pressure sensor and its hose, usually located behind the control panel or near the tub. Carefully disconnect the hose from both ends. You can then try blowing through the hose to check for blockages. If it is clogged, you can often clear it with warm water and mild detergent.

The pressure sensor itself can also fail. If the hose is clear and the problem persists, the sensor might be faulty. A faulty sensor sends incorrect signals to the main control board, leading to overfilling or underfilling. Testing the sensor usually requires a multimeter to check for continuity or specific resistance readings, which can be more complex. If you are not comfortable with electrical testing, a professional can help diagnose a faulty sensor. Replacing a pressure sensor involves disconnecting its electrical connector and the air hose, then securing the new one in place. Ensure all connections are tight before reassembling your washer. This step is vital for proper function and safety.

### Addressing Siphon Effect and Drain Hose Problems

Sometimes, the reason your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water is not a faulty part, but an improper installation of the drain hose. This is a common and often overlooked cause called the "siphon effect." If the drain hose is inserted too far down into your standpipe or drain utility sink, it can create a continuous siphon. This means the washer tries to drain, but simultaneously, water from the drain line gets pulled back into the wash tub. It creates a cycle where the machine keeps filling, trying to drain, and then refilling.

To prevent this siphon effect, the drain hose needs proper air gap. The end of the drain hose should be positioned correctly. For a standpipe, the hose should only go about 6-8 inches down. It should not create a tight seal. For a utility sink, the hose should be secured above the water level in the sink. Most washing machine manuals provide a specific height range for the drain hose, often between 30 and 36 inches from the floor. This high loop or air gap prevents dirty drain water from flowing back into the washer tub.

Check your current drain hose setup. Is it too low? Is it too deep in the drain pipe? Adjust its position according to your LG washer's manual. You can use a zip tie or a hose clamp to secure it to the back of the washer or to the standpipe to maintain the correct height. Ensure the hose is not kinked or blocked, as this can also impede proper drainage and lead to water issues. Sometimes, lint or debris can accumulate in the drain hose over time. You might want to clean the hose if you suspect a blockage. Proper drain hose setup is a simple but effective fix that can resolve many unexpected water level problems. This kind of easy fix shows why a [DIY Washing Machine Repair](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) approach can be very helpful.

### When the LG Washer Control Board Causes Overfilling

While less common than a faulty valve or sensor, a malfunctioning main control board can also be why your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water. The control board is the "brain" of your washing machine. It receives signals from all the sensors, including the pressure sensor and water inlet valve. It then sends commands to the various components to start and stop functions. If the control board develops an internal fault, it might incorrectly interpret sensor readings or send continuous signals to the water inlet valve, causing the washer to fill endlessly.

Diagnosing a control board issue is often more challenging than other problems. You cannot simply look at it to see if it is broken. Symptoms of a faulty control board might include erratic behavior, such as cycles not completing, lights flashing randomly, or, in this case, constant water filling even when the machine is unplugged (if the water inlet valve's solenoid is powered directly by a stuck relay on the board). Before suspecting the control board, it is wise to rule out all other possibilities first, such as the water inlet valve, pressure sensor, and drain hose. These are typically easier and less expensive to fix.

If you suspect the control board, you might try a hard reset of the washing machine. Unplug the washer from the power outlet for a few minutes (e.g., 5-10 minutes) and then plug it back in. This can sometimes clear minor electronic glitches. However, if the issue persists, the control board might need replacement. Replacing a control board involves disconnecting multiple wire harnesses and mounting screws. It is a more complex repair that might be best left to a qualified appliance technician, especially given the cost of the part. Improper installation of a new board can lead to further damage to your machine. Always prioritize safety and disconnect power before any internal inspection.

### Checking for Overflow Sensor and Dispenser Clogs

Beyond the primary components, an LG washing machine keeps filling up with water due to less obvious issues. Your machine might have an additional overflow sensor or safety float switch. This component acts as a backup, designed to prevent flooding if the water level exceeds a safe limit. If this sensor is faulty or obstructed, it might fail to trigger the drain pump when the water level gets too high. This is usually a secondary safety measure, but its malfunction can contribute to a perpetual filling problem or failure to stop filling at all. You can usually find this float switch at the bottom of the tub, and it should move freely.

Another subtle cause can be related to the detergent dispenser. While not directly causing the washer to fill, severe detergent residue buildup or clogs in the dispenser can sometimes redirect water flow. In rare cases, water meant for the wash cycle might not fully enter the tub or might cause back pressure issues that trick the system. More often, excessive suds from too much detergent can fool the pressure sensor into thinking there isn't enough water, causing it to add more. Using too much detergent, especially with HE washers, creates a high volume of suds that mimic water, leading to overfilling. Remember, LG HE washers need very little detergent. For help with routine cleaning, check out our guide on [Cleaning Your LG Washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washer).

To address these possibilities, first, check the overflow sensor or float switch for any physical obstructions. Ensure it moves freely and is not stuck. For the detergent dispenser, regularly clean it to prevent residue buildup. Many LG washers have removable dispenser drawers that you can wash under warm water. You should also ensure you are using the correct type and amount of detergent. Always use high-efficiency (HE) detergent in HE washers, and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for quantity. These preventative measures can help avoid future overfilling issues and keep your machine running smoothly. It's also a good idea to periodically consider [Cleaning Your Washing Machine Filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter) to prevent drain issues.

### External Factors and Professional Help for LG Washer Water Issues

Sometimes, the reason your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water is not entirely internal to the machine itself. External factors like household water pressure can play a role. While high water pressure alone usually does not cause continuous filling, extremely fluctuating or high pressure could put stress on the water inlet valve over time, leading to its eventual failure. If you live in an area with known water pressure issues, installing a pressure regulator on your home's main water line might be beneficial to protect all your appliances, including your LG washer.

Also, consider the electrical supply to your washer. While unlikely to cause constant filling by itself, unstable power can affect the control board's operation. Ensure your washer is plugged into a dedicated outlet and that there are no loose connections. A power surge protector can offer an extra layer of defense for the machine's sensitive electronics. These are general checks that contribute to the overall health of your appliance.

If you have systematically checked the water inlet valve, pressure sensor and hose, drain hose setup, and dispenser, and your LG washing machine still keeps filling up with water, it is time to call a professional. Some issues, like a faulty control board or deeply internal leaks, require specialized tools and expertise. A certified appliance technician can accurately diagnose complex electrical problems or component failures. They have the experience to repair your LG washer safely and effectively, ensuring no further damage occurs. Ignoring the problem can lead to water damage, mold growth, or even electrical hazards. Do not hesitate to seek expert help if you are unsure or uncomfortable with any repair step.
