### Clear Answer to the Main Query

To effectively get blood out of bedding, act quickly. Rinse fresh stains with cold water. For persistent or dried blood, apply hydrogen peroxide, an enzyme cleaner, or a paste of salt and cold water. Gently blot, then wash the bedding in cold water with appropriate detergent, avoiding heat until the stain is gone.

## Act Quickly: Removing Fresh Blood Stains From Bedding

You just found a fresh blood stain on your bedding. Do not panic. Speed is your best friend when dealing with these marks. The faster you act, the easier the stain comes out. I always tell my friends this crucial first step.

The first rule is simple: use cold water. Hot water makes blood proteins set into the fabric. This makes the stain much harder to remove. Think of it like cooking an egg; heat makes it solid. You want to avoid this effect on your sheets. Immediately take the stained bedding off the bed.

Next, hold the stained area under a stream of cold running water. Let the water run through the back of the fabric. This pushes the blood out of the fibers, not deeper into them. You will see the stain lighten and sometimes disappear completely. If the stain is small, a simple cold water rinse might be all you need. Keep rinsing until no more blood comes out.

If some blood remains, rub a little bar soap or liquid laundry detergent onto the damp spot. Use a gentle scrubbing motion. You can also use an old toothbrush. Then
