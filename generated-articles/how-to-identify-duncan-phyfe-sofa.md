Many furniture makers created pieces in the Duncan Phyfe style. This makes identification challenging. True Duncan Phyfe pieces are rare. They were expensive when new. Later reproductions often lack the finesse and precise details of originals.

Look for a general sense of mass-production in reproductions. The carvings might be less crisp. The wood quality could be inferior. Joinery might be less precise. Originals show a master's hand in every detail. Reproductions often feel heavier or less graceful.

Condition plays a role in identifying and valuing antique furniture. An authentic Duncan Phyfe sofa will show signs of age. This includes minor scratches, wear on the wood, or fading. These imperfections contribute to its patina. Patina is the natural sheen that develops over time.
