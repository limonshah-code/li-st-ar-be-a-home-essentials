## Wash Suede Shoes in Your Machine: A Gentle Guide

Suede shoes add a touch of elegance to any outfit. However, they also attract dirt and stains easily. Many people think washing suede shoes in a washing machine is impossible. They worry about ruining the delicate material.

I understand this concern completely. I have faced the same dilemma with my favorite suede boots. The good news is, you can wash suede shoes in a washing machine if you follow the right steps. This guide will show you how to do it safely and effectively. We will cover everything from preparation to drying and post-wash care.

### Takeaway

### Can You Wash Suede Shoes In A Washing Machine?

Yes, you can machine wash suede shoes, but you must take specific precautions. Real suede is delicate, so a gentle cycle with cold water is essential. Proper preparation and careful air drying prevent damage and help maintain the shoe's look.

### Understanding Suede: Is Your Pair Machine Washable?

Knowing your shoe material is the first step. Not all suede is the same. Some shoes handle machine washing better than others. It is important to identify your specific type of suede before you begin.

Real suede is made from the underside of animal skin. It feels soft and velvety. Faux suede is a synthetic material. It often looks like real suede but can be more durable. Faux suede usually holds up better in a washing machine.

Always check the care label inside your shoes. This label gives specific cleaning instructions. If there is no label, or it says "dry clean only," be extra careful. Shoes with delicate embellishments, glued soles, or very fragile structures may not survive a machine wash. These types of shoes should be cleaned by hand instead. If you are unsure, it is better to clean by hand to avoid damage. You can learn more about if you can machine wash suede shoes by checking resources like [Can I Machine Wash Suede Shoes?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-machine-wash-suede-shoes).

I always inspect my shoes closely for any loose parts. I also check for any areas that seem delicate. Shoes with complex stitching or multiple materials might be too risky for the washer. It's important to differentiate between machine washable materials and those that are not. For general guidance, explore articles like [Can You Put Suede In The Washing Machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-u-put-suede-in-the-washing-machine) and [Can Suede Be Washed In Washing Machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-suede-be-washed-in-washing-machine). These resources explain the nuances of washing different types of suede. They also highlight potential risks involved.

Consider the overall condition of your shoes too. Very old or worn-out shoes may not withstand the agitation. The material might tear or the sole might separate. Brand new shoes might be a better candidate for gentle machine washing. This section helps you make an informed decision. You want to ensure your shoes come out clean, not damaged.

### Gathering Your Tools: Essential Items for Suede Shoe Washing

Proper tools make the washing process easier and safer. You do not need many special items to wash suede shoes. Most things you might already have around your house. Having everything ready beforehand saves time and prevents mistakes.

First, you will need a soft-bristled brush. A dedicated suede brush is ideal. If you do not have one, a soft toothbrush or a clean nail brush works well. This brush helps remove loose dirt without harming the nap. I always keep a suede brush handy for quick touch-ups.

Next, get a mild liquid laundry detergent. Choose a detergent free of harsh chemicals or bleach. Powders can leave residue on the suede. A small amount is all you need. Harsh detergents can strip the natural oils from suede, making it stiff.

A mesh laundry bag is crucial. This bag protects your shoes from bumping around inside the washing machine. It also keeps laces and insoles from getting tangled. Using a bag is a simple step that provides great protection. I never wash shoes without placing them in a mesh bag first.

Collect a few old towels. These towels will go into the washer with your shoes. They balance the load and absorb some of the impact. This prevents the shoes from slamming against the drum. They also help cushion the shoes.

Finally, prepare some shoe trees or crumpled newspaper. You will use these for drying. They help maintain the shoe's shape. This prevents shrinking or misshaping as the suede dries. These tools are simple but important for a successful wash. For stubborn dirt, you might also want a specific cleaner.

### Pre-Wash Preparations: Getting Your Suede Shoes Ready

Preparation is key to successful machine washing. Skipping these steps can lead to poor results or even damage. Taking a few minutes to prepare will protect your shoes. It also ensures a deeper clean.

Start by removing the laces from your shoes. Laces can get tangled in the washing machine. They can also prevent a thorough cleaning of the tongue area. I usually wash laces separately by hand or in a small mesh bag. Take out any removable insoles as well. Insoles often hold a lot of odor and moisture. Washing them separately allows them to dry more quickly and completely.

Next, use your soft brush to remove loose dirt, mud, and debris. Gently brush the entire surface of the suede. Brush in one direction to maintain the nap. Pay special attention to the soles and edges. This step prevents dirt from being ground deeper into the suede during washing. It also stops it from clogging your machine's filter.

Spot treat any stubborn stains. You can use a suede cleaner or a small amount of mild liquid detergent mixed with water. Apply it to the stain with a clean cloth or sponge. Gently rub the area. For tough stains, a suede eraser can work wonders. Address oil, grease, or mud spots before they set.

If your shoes have a strong odor, this is a good time to address it. You can sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit overnight. This absorbs smells. Pre-treating odors ensures your shoes come out smelling fresh.

These steps ensure your suede shoes are truly ready for their wash cycle.

### Washing Suede Shoes in the Machine: Step-by-Step Guide

The actual washing part requires precision. Setting your machine correctly is vital. Incorrect settings can cause irreversible damage to your suede. We aim for a gentle, effective clean.

First, place your prepared suede shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. If you are washing two shoes, put them in separate bags or one large bag. This prevents them from knocking against each other. It also keeps them from directly hitting the washer drum. I always zip the bag securely.

Next, add 2-4 old towels to the washing machine drum. These towels serve two main purposes. They help balance the load, preventing the machine from becoming unbalanced. They also provide cushioning. This cushioning protects your shoes from harsh impacts during the wash cycle. The towels absorb some of the agitation.

Now, set your washing machine. Always choose a cold water setting. Hot water can shrink suede, warp its shape, or cause colors to bleed. Select the delicate or gentle cycle. This cycle uses less agitation. It mimics a hand wash, which is ideal for sensitive materials like suede. Avoid any cycles with high spin speeds. These can be too harsh.

Add a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent. I usually use about half the amount I would for a normal load. Use liquid detergent, not powder. Powdered detergent can leave white residue on the suede. Distribute the detergent evenly in the dispenser. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. These chemicals can damage suede fibers. For general advice on machine washing shoes, refer to [How To Machine Wash Shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-machine-wash-shoes). The wash cycle duration is also important; you can find more information about it in articles like [How Long To Wash Shoes In Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-to-wash-shoes-in-washing-machine). If you have specific machine brands, checking their guidelines can be helpful, for example, [Can You Wash Shoes In LG Washing Machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-lg-washing-machine).

Once you have everything set, start the machine. Monitor the wash process. Listen for any unusual sounds. The gentle cycle should keep the shoes from thumping loudly. When the cycle finishes, immediately remove the shoes from the machine. Do not let them sit in damp conditions.

### Drying Suede Shoes Safely: Protecting Their Shape and Texture

Drying suede shoes correctly is as important as washing them. Incorrect drying methods can permanently ruin the material. The goal is to air dry them gently and slowly. This helps maintain their shape and softness.

The most critical rule: never put suede shoes in a dryer. High heat is suede's enemy. It will shrink the material, make it stiff, and likely cause cracking. The heat can also melt glues used in shoe construction. This can lead to the soles separating. I have seen many shoes ruined this way, and I always advise against it. You can explore more about drying shoes in articles like [Can I Dry Shoes In Washing Machine?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-dry-shoes-in-washing-machine) to understand potential risks and alternative methods.

After removing your shoes from the washing machine, gently blot them with a clean, dry towel. This removes excess moisture. Do not wring or twist the shoes. Just a light patting is enough. The less water in the suede, the faster it will dry.

Next, stuff the shoes with crumpled white paper towels or newspaper. You can also use shoe trees if you have them. The paper absorbs remaining moisture from the inside. It also helps the shoes keep their original shape as they dry. Make sure to use plain white paper. Ink from colored newspaper can transfer onto the damp suede. Replace the paper every few hours if it becomes saturated. This speeds up the drying process.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight or artificial heat sources. Direct heat can dry suede too quickly and make it brittle. A shaded spot indoors, perhaps near an open window, is perfect. Air circulation is vital for even drying.

Allow your suede shoes to dry completely. This can take 24 to 48 hours, or even longer for thicker suede. Do not rush the process. Suede that is not fully dry can develop mildew or become stiff. Periodically check the shoes. Feel for any dampness, especially in thicker areas. Patience is key during this stage.

### Post-Wash Care: Restoring Suede's Softness and Appearance

Once your suede shoes are completely dry, they might look a bit stiff or matted. This is normal. The fibers have been wet and compressed. The final steps involve restoring their original soft, fuzzy texture. This post-wash care brings your shoes back to life.

The most important step is re-brushing the suede. Use your suede brush or a clean, soft-bristled brush. Gently brush the entire surface of the shoes. Brush in multiple directions to lift the nap. This separates the individual suede fibers. You will notice the suede becoming softer and more velvety again. Keep brushing until the texture is even.

If the suede feels a little stiff, you can gently flex the shoes. This helps to break up any stiffness. Do not bend them too harshly. Just a gentle movement can restore flexibility. Some minor water spots might appear. You can usually remove these with a suede eraser or by gently rubbing the spot with a clean, dry cloth.

Consider applying a suede protector spray. This spray creates a barrier against water and stains. It does not make your shoes waterproof, but it offers a good level of protection. Apply the spray evenly according to the product instructions. Always do a patch test on an inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not alter the color of your suede. A protector spray extends the life of your clean shoes.

Regular maintenance will keep your suede shoes looking good for longer. Brush them regularly to remove dust and light dirt. Address new stains quickly. Store them in a dust bag when not in use. These habits prevent future deep cleaning needs. Your efforts in washing and drying will be rewarded with revived, beautiful suede shoes.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues After Washing Suede

Sometimes, despite following all the steps, you might encounter minor issues. Do not panic. Most problems after washing suede are fixable. Knowing how to address them quickly helps restore your shoes.

One common issue is stiffness. Suede can feel rigid after drying. This happens because the fibers contract. To fix this, gently brush the suede with a suede brush. Brush in different directions. This helps to loosen the fibers and restore softness. You can also gently flex the shoe. This movement helps break down the stiffness. Just be careful not to crease the material.

Water spots or rings might appear, even with cold water. This often happens if the shoes did not dry evenly. To remove these, try a suede eraser. Gently rub the eraser over the spot. You can also lightly dampen a clean cloth with distilled water. Gently dab the water ring from the outside in. This helps to "feather out" the ring. Then, let the shoe air dry again.

The nap might look matted or uneven. This is also a common occurrence. The washing process can press the fibers down. Use your suede brush to lift the nap. Brush vigorously but gently. Brush against the grain first, then with the grain. This brings back the uniform, soft texture of the suede. Patience is important here.

Color fading is less common with cold water washing. However, if you notice slight fading, there are suede dyes available. These can restore the original color. Always test any dye on an unseen area first. This ensures the color match is correct. Read the product instructions carefully.

If your shoes still have a faint odor, try a baking soda treatment again. Sprinkle baking soda inside the dry shoes. Let it sit for 24 hours, then vacuum it out. This often absorbs any lingering smells. Addressing these issues correctly ensures your hard work pays off. Your suede shoes can look great again.
