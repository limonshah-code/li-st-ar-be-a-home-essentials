## First-Time Cleaning and Maintenance Tips

Maintaining your new LG refrigerator from the start extends its lifespan. Regular cleaning prevents odors and keeps your food safe. For the interior, use a solution of warm water and mild dish soap. Wipe down all surfaces, including shelves, drawers, and the door gasket. The door gasket is the seal around the door; keep it clean to ensure a tight seal. A dirty or sticky gasket can prevent the door from closing properly. This wastes energy.

For stubborn spills, a baking soda paste can work wonders. Mix baking soda with a little water to form a paste. Apply it to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe clean. Always dry interior surfaces thoroughly after cleaning. This prevents mold and mildew growth. Regular interior cleaning helps maintain a fresh environment for your food. This practice is similar to the care taken when learning [how to clean Samsung oven first time](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-samsung-oven-first-time) to preserve its initial quality.

### Exterior Care and Condenser Coil Cleaning

The exterior of your LG refrigerator also needs attention. For stainless steel finishes, use a microfiber cloth and a specialized stainless steel cleaner. Always wipe in the direction of the grain to avoid streaks. For other finishes, a soft cloth and mild soap and water are sufficient. Keep the exterior clean to maintain its appearance.

One of the most important maintenance tasks is cleaning the condenser coils. These coils are usually located at the back or bottom of the refrigerator. They dissipate heat, and if covered in dust, the refrigerator works harder. This increases energy consumption and reduces efficiency. Unplug the refrigerator before cleaning the coils. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to gently remove dust and debris. Do this at least once or twice a year.

### Managing Odors and Understanding Door Alarms

Even in a new refrigerator, odors can develop over time. To prevent this, promptly clean up spills. Store strong-smelling foods in airtight containers. A box of baking soda placed in the refrigerator can help absorb odors. Replace it every three months. For persistent odors, try wiping the interior with a solution of white vinegar and water.

Your LG refrigerator has a door alarm feature. This alarm sounds if a door stays open for too long. It helps prevent energy waste and food spoilage. Make sure doors close completely after each use.

Proper and regular maintenance ensures your LG refrigerator continues to perform at its best.

## Maximizing Energy Efficiency and Lifespan

Making your LG refrigerator energy efficient begins with how you use it daily. Keeping the doors open for short periods saves energy. Decide what you need before opening the door. Close the door quickly once you get your items. This simple habit prevents cold air from escaping. The refrigerator does not need to work as hard to maintain its temperature.

Proper temperature settings are also key. The recommended 37°F (3°C) for the refrigerator and 0°F (-18°C) for the freezer balances food safety and energy use. Colder settings use more energy without providing significant benefits for most foods. Avoid placing hot food directly into the refrigerator. Let it cool down on the counter first. Hot food makes the refrigerator work harder to cool itself down.

### Strategic Food Placement for Better Efficiency

The way you arrange food impacts efficiency. Do not overfill the refrigerator. Overpacking blocks airflow, making the compressor work harder. This means uneven cooling and higher energy consumption. Leave some space between items for air to circulate.

However, a nearly empty refrigerator is also less efficient. When your refrigerator is partly empty, the air inside changes temperature more quickly when the door opens. Fill empty spaces with water bottles or empty milk jugs. These items act as thermal masses. They help maintain a stable temperature when the door is opened. A full, but not overstuffed, refrigerator operates more efficiently.

### Regular Checks and Professional Servicing

Regular maintenance checks contribute to your refrigerator's long life. Check the door seals (gaskets) every few months. Close a dollar bill in the door; if you can pull it out easily, the seal might be weak. A weak seal allows cold air to escape. Clean gaskets regularly to keep them pliable and effective.

Consider professional servicing if you notice persistent issues. Unusual noises, inefficient cooling, or excessive energy consumption are signs. A professional technician can diagnose and fix problems before they become major. Regular care and proactive maintenance ensure your LG refrigerator provides reliable service for many years. These steps help your appliance run smoothly and efficiently.
