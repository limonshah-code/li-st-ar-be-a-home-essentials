## Understanding OEM vs. Aftermarket Kenmore Parts

When searching for Kenmore dishwasher parts, you will encounter two main types. These are Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts and aftermarket parts. Knowing the difference helps you make the right choice. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. Your decision often depends on budget and priority for quality.

### Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Parts

OEM parts are made by the same company that manufactured your Kenmore dishwasher. Or by a supplier approved by Kenmore. These parts are identical to the ones originally installed in your appliance. They guarantee the best fit and performance. OEM parts meet strict quality standards. They often come with a manufacturer's warranty. This protects you if the part fails prematurely.

The main advantage of OEM parts is reliability. You know they will work correctly. They help maintain your dishwasher's warranty. They also ensure the longevity of your appliance. The main drawback is their cost. OEM parts are usually more expensive. This can affect your repair budget. For critical components like control boards or pumps, OEM is often the safest choice.

### Aftermarket and Compatible Parts

Aftermarket parts are produced by companies other than the original manufacturer. These parts are designed to be compatible with Kenmore dishwashers. They aim to replicate the function of OEM parts. Aftermarket parts are typically more affordable. This is their biggest appeal. They can offer a cost-effective repair solution. Many aftermarket parts perform well.

However, aftermarket parts can vary in quality. Some are excellent. Others might not fit as precisely or last as long as OEM parts. The warranty on aftermarket parts might also differ. It is important to research the brand and read reviews. For less critical components like racks, wheels, or spray arms, aftermarket options are often suitable. Consider the specific part's role. Assess if the cost savings outweigh any potential risks.

*   **When to Choose Which:**
    *   **Choose OEM:** For critical components (motor, control board, heating element). When warranty is important. For peace of mind about perfect fit and quality.
    *   **Choose Aftermarket:** For non-critical parts (racks, handles, common gaskets). When budget is a primary concern. When reputable aftermarket brands are available.
