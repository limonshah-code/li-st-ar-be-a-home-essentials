*   **Develop Sewing Skills:** This project is suitable for various skill levels.
*   **Save Money:** Make a cover for less than buying one.
*   **Extend Mixer Life:** Keep your KitchenAid looking new.

### Quick Answer:

To sew a KitchenAid stand mixer cover, measure your mixer's height, width, and depth. Use these measurements to draft a simple pattern on paper. Cut your chosen fabric according to the pattern. Stitch the fabric pieces together with a sewing machine. Add any desired decorative elements.

## Why Sew a KitchenAid Stand Mixer Cover?

Your KitchenAid stand mixer is a valuable kitchen tool. It helps you bake delicious treats. Protecting this appliance makes good sense. A custom cover keeps dust and grime away. It also guards against scratches and spills.

Many people keep their mixers on the counter. This makes them prone to collecting dust. A cover acts as a shield. It keeps your mixer clean between uses. This means less cleaning time for you. You can just remove the cover and start baking.

Beyond protection, a homemade cover adds style. You choose the fabric. This allows you to match your kitchen decor perfectly. You can select colors, patterns, and textures. A custom cover makes your mixer look like a planned part of your kitchen design. It adds a personal touch to your home.

Sewing your own cover also saves money. Store-bought covers can be expensive. Making one yourself is often much cheaper. You only pay for the fabric and thread. This project also uses your sewing skills. It is a satisfying way to create something useful. You can feel proud of your handmade item.

## Gathering Your Sewing Essentials for the Mixer Cover

Before you start sewing, collect all necessary tools. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. You will need a sewing machine. Make sure it is in good working order. A basic sewing machine works well for this project.

Fabric is the most important material. Choose a sturdy fabric. Cotton duck, canvas, or even quilting cotton work well. Consider the fabric's weight. A heavier fabric offers better protection. It also holds its shape nicely. Lighter fabrics might need a lining for stability. Think about how easy the fabric is to clean. You want something durable for kitchen use.

Thread should match your fabric color. Strong polyester thread is a good choice. You will also need sharp fabric scissors. A rotary cutter and mat are useful for straight cuts. Measuring tools are crucial. Get a flexible tape measure and a clear ruler. Straight pins will hold your fabric pieces together.

Other helpful items include an iron and ironing board. Pressing seams makes your cover look professional. A seam ripper is handy for fixing mistakes. Don't forget a fabric marker or tailor's chalk. This helps you mark your cutting lines accurately. Having these supplies ready will set you up for success.

## Accurate Measurements for Your KitchenAid Mixer Cover

Taking precise measurements is key to a well-fitting cover. Do not guess your mixer's size. Take out your KitchenAid stand mixer. Make sure it is empty and ready to be measured. You need three main measurements: height, width, and depth.

First, measure the height. Place your tape measure at the base of the mixer. Extend it straight up to the top. Include the bowl lift mechanism if your mixer has one. Write down this number. Then, measure the width. This is usually the widest part of the mixer from side to side. It is often the top or the base. Note this measurement. Finally, measure the depth. This is from the front to the back of the mixer. Again, find the deepest point.

Add some ease to your measurements. You do not want the cover to be too tight. Add 1 inch to the height. Add 2 inches to both the width and depth measurements. This extra room allows the cover to slip on easily. It also accounts for seam allowances. Write down your adjusted measurements clearly. This will be your cutting guide.

*   **Height:** From base to highest point, add 1 inch.
*   **Width:** Widest point side to side, add 2 inches.
*   **Depth:** Front to back, add 2 inches.

Double-check your numbers. An incorrect measurement means a poorly fitting cover. Accuracy here saves time later. If you are unsure, measure again. This step is like planning a project; good plans lead to good results. Knowing how to measure properly is vital for any sewing project, similar to how you would measure for [how to sew a chair slipcover](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-sew-a-chair-slipcover).

## Creating Your Custom KitchenAid Mixer Cover Pattern

Now you have your measurements. It is time to create a pattern. This step makes cutting fabric much easier. You will typically create a three-piece pattern. This includes one main body piece and two side pieces.

First, draw the main body piece. This piece will go over the top and down the front and back of your mixer. Its width will be your adjusted width measurement. Its length will be your adjusted height multiplied by two, plus your adjusted depth. For example, if your height is 16 inches and depth is 10 inches, the length would be (16 * 2) + 10 = 42 inches. Mark this rectangle on a large piece of paper. Brown craft paper or newspaper works well.

Next, draw the two side pieces. These will be rectangular or slightly shaped. Their width will be your adjusted depth measurement. Their height will be your adjusted height measurement. Draw two identical rectangles. Remember, these are the ends of your mixer cover. You can slightly round the top corners of these side pieces if you want a softer look for your cover.

Now, add seam allowances to all pattern pieces. A standard seam allowance is 1/2 inch or 5/8 inch. I recommend 1/2 inch for this project. Draw a line 1/2 inch outside the main outline of each pattern piece. This outer line is where you will cut. Cut out all your pattern pieces carefully. Lay them out on your fabric. Pin them down. Cut the fabric accurately following your marked lines. You will have one large main piece and two side pieces. If you've ever thought about sewing other covers, the principles are similar, like creating a [how to sew a cover for a pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-sew-a-cover-for-a-pillow).

## Stitching Your KitchenAid Stand Mixer Cover Together

With your fabric pieces cut, you are ready to sew. This is where your custom KitchenAid stand mixer cover takes shape. I suggest using a straight stitch. A standard stitch length of 2.5 mm works well.

First, prepare your side panels. Hem the bottom edge of each side panel. Fold the bottom edge up by 1/2 inch. Press it with an iron. Fold it up another 1/2 inch. Press again. Stitch this hem in place. This creates a neat finish at the base of your cover. Repeat for both side panels.

Next, attach the side panels to the main body piece. Take one side panel. Align its top edge with the top edge of the main body piece. The right sides of the fabric should be facing each other. Pin them together along the top edge. Stitch this seam. Use a 1/2-inch seam allowance. Repeat for the other side panel. You should now have a long piece of fabric with two side panels attached at the top.

Now, fold the main body piece in half lengthwise. This brings the two long raw edges together. The side panels will now align. Pin the raw long edges of the main body piece together. Pin the side seams where the side panels meet the main body. Stitch these seams. This forms the basic shape of your mixer cover. Press all seams open for a clean look. You are almost done. This step requires precision, much like when you learn [how to sew a box cushion cover with velcro closure](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-sew-a-box-cushion-cover-with-velcro-closure).

## Adding Finishing Touches to Your Mixer Cover

Finishing touches elevate your homemade KitchenAid stand mixer cover. These details make your cover look professional and custom. After assembling the main body, you need to hem the bottom edge. This creates a clean, durable finish. Fold the raw bottom edge up by 1/2 inch. Press it with an iron to create a crisp fold. Then, fold it up another 1 inch. Press again. Stitch this hem securely in place. Use a straight stitch close to the folded edge.

Consider adding decorative elements. Pockets are a useful addition. You can sew a pocket onto one of the side panels. This pocket can hold mixer attachments or recipe cards. Cut a rectangle of fabric for the pocket. Hem the top edge of the pocket. Press the other three edges under by 1/2 inch. Pin the pocket to the desired location on a side panel before sewing the cover together. Stitch the pocket onto the cover. This makes your cover even more functional.

You might also add trim or piping. Piping along the seams adds a professional look. Bias tape can finish raw edges inside the cover neatly. You could also embroider a design. Maybe your initial or a small kitchen motif. Ribbons or decorative buttons can also enhance the design. These small details show care and craftsmanship. They make your cover truly unique.

*   **Bottom Hem:** Fold, press, and stitch a double hem.
*   **Pockets:** Add a practical pocket for attachments.
*   **Decorative Trim:** Use piping, bias tape, or ribbon.
*   **Embroidery:** Personalize with a stitched design.

Taking time for these finishing touches will make your mixer cover a prized item. It won't just protect your mixer; it will also be a beautiful addition to your kitchen.

## Caring for Your Homemade KitchenAid Mixer Cover

Once your beautiful KitchenAid stand mixer cover is complete, you will want to keep it looking new. Proper care ensures its longevity and maintains its appearance. The cleaning instructions for your cover depend on the fabric you chose.

For most cotton or canvas covers, machine washing is an option. Use cold water and a gentle cycle. Harsh detergents can fade colors. Avoid using bleach, as it can damage fabric fibers. If your fabric has a print, turn the cover inside out before washing. This helps protect the print from fading. For minor spills or dust, a damp cloth can often wipe the cover clean. Spot cleaning can prevent the need for a full wash.

Drying your cover properly is also important. Air drying is always the best choice for handmade items. Hang the cover on a clothesline or drying rack. Let it dry completely. This prevents shrinkage and helps the cover maintain its shape. If you must use a dryer, choose a low heat setting. Remove the cover while it is still slightly damp. Then, air dry it flat to avoid wrinkles. High heat can shrink fabrics.

Iron your cover for a crisp, neat look. Use an iron setting appropriate for your fabric type. If your fabric is cotton, a medium-to-high heat setting is usually fine. Always iron on the wrong side of the fabric if there is a decorative print. This prevents damage to the design. Store your cover folded neatly when not in use. Following these simple care steps ensures your custom mixer cover protects your appliance for many years.
