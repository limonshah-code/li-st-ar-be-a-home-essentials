## Understanding and Testing Your KitchenAid Dishwasher Pump

Having a dishwasher that does not clean or drain properly frustrates anyone. Often, the pump is the main cause of these problems. If your KitchenAid dishwasher is leaving water at the bottom, or dishes come out dirty, you might need to test the pump. Learning how to test a KitchenAid dishwasher pump can save you time and money.

This guide helps you understand how dishwasher pumps work. We will show you common symptoms of a bad pump. You will learn the steps to safely access and test both the drain and circulation pumps. We also cover what tools you need and how to perform electrical tests. Following these instructions will help you diagnose the issue accurately.

**Takeaway:**
*   Always disconnect power and water before starting any dishwasher repair.
*   Identify the type of pump issue (drainage or wash performance) to guide your troubleshooting.
*   Use a multimeter to check for continuity, resistance, and voltage at the pump.
*   Visually inspect impellers and remove any obstructions that can prevent pump function.

To test a KitchenAid dishwasher pump, first disconnect power and water. Then, access the pump by removing the lower spray arm and sump cover. Use a multimeter to check the pump motor for continuity, resistance, and proper voltage supply, looking for values within the manufacturer's specifications.

## Understanding Your KitchenAid Dishwasher Pump System

Your KitchenAid dishwasher has two main pumps: the drain pump and the circulation pump. Each pump does a specific job. The drain pump removes water from the tub after a wash cycle. The circulation pump, also called the wash pump, moves water through the spray arms to clean your dishes. Both pumps are essential for your dishwasher's performance.

If dishes are still dirty after a cycle, the circulation pump might have a problem. If water remains in the tub, the drain pump likely has a fault. Knowing which pump to suspect helps narrow down your troubleshooting. This understanding saves you effort and time during repairs. I find it helpful to think of them as two separate systems, each with its own signs of trouble.

KitchenAid dishwashers, like many Whirlpool models, use robust pump designs. However, mechanical parts can wear out over time. Debris, hard water, or electrical faults can cause pumps to fail. Recognizing the symptoms of a failing pump is the first step in fixing your appliance.

Common pump issues often include strange noises during operation. You might hear a humming sound if the motor struggles or is jammed. No sound at all means no power or a completely failed motor. Pay attention to these early warning signs. Addressing them quickly can prevent more serious damage to your dishwasher.

## Safety First: Preparing for KitchenAid Dishwasher Pump Testing

Before you touch any part of your KitchenAid dishwasher, safety must come first. Working with appliances and electricity can be dangerous if you do not take proper precautions. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before starting any inspection or repair. This prevents electric shock. I always make sure the power is off before I even pick up a tool.

Locate your home's circuit breaker box and switch off the breaker for the kitchen or the dishwasher circuit. If you are unsure which breaker it is, turn off the main breaker for the house. It is better to be safe than sorry. You can also unplug the dishwasher if it has an accessible power cord.

Next, shut off the water supply to the dishwasher. Most dishwashers have a dedicated shut-off valve under the kitchen sink. Turn this valve clockwise until the water flow stops completely. This prevents water spills during the repair. If there is no dedicated valve, you may need to turn off the main water supply to your house.

Gather all your necessary tools before you start. You will need a Phillips head screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, adjustable pliers, and a bucket or towels for any residual water. A flashlight is also useful for seeing into tight spaces. Most importantly, you need a multimeter for electrical testing.

Having the right tools ready makes the job smoother and safer. Always wear work gloves to protect your hands from sharp edges or chemicals. A dry work area is also important. If you need help turning off the power, refer to our guide on [how to turn off KitchenAid dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-off-kitchenaid-dishwasher) for detailed instructions.

## Troubleshooting Common KitchenAid Dishwasher Pump Symptoms

When your KitchenAid dishwasher acts up, the symptoms often point directly to the pump. One of the most common signs of a bad drain pump is standing water in the bottom of the tub. After a wash cycle, the water should be completely gone. If you see water there, the drain pump is not doing its job. This can also cause a bad odor over time.

Another clear symptom related to the drain pump is slow drainage. The dishwasher may eventually drain, but it takes much longer than normal. This suggests the pump is struggling, perhaps due to partial clogs or a weakening motor. You might hear the pump working harder than usual. I always listen for any changes in sound during the drain cycle.

If your dishes are not getting clean, even after a full wash cycle, the circulation pump is likely the culprit. The spray arms might not be getting enough water pressure. This results in food particles remaining on your plates and glasses. You might also notice a lack of water spraying inside the tub during the wash cycle.

Strange noises coming from the dishwasher can also indicate a pump problem. A high-pitched whine or a grinding sound often points to a worn-out pump motor bearing. A humming noise with no water movement might mean the pump motor is receiving power but cannot spin due to an obstruction. If you see water standing, understand [why does my KitchenAid dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) to narrow down possibilities.

Sometimes, the dishwasher completes its cycle, but the dishes are still soaking wet. While this can relate to the heating element, a failing circulation pump that struggles to move hot water efficiently can also contribute. Always consider these symptoms together to form a clear picture of the problem.

## How To Access KitchenAid Dishwasher Pumps

Accessing the dishwasher pumps involves a few steps, but it is manageable for most DIYers. First, pull the dishwasher out from under the counter. You will need to disconnect the power cord and water supply hose from the back. It is often easier to lay the dishwasher on its back or side for better access to the bottom. Make sure to place towels or cardboard underneath to protect your floor.

Once the dishwasher is on its back, you can see the components on the underside. The drain pump is usually smaller and located near the front of the unit, connected to the drain hose. The circulation pump is typically larger, located closer to the center or rear, and connects to the wash manifold. Identifying these two pumps is crucial for proper testing.

To gain full access, you might need to remove a metal access panel or cover from the bottom of the dishwasher. This panel is usually held in place by a few screws. Use your Phillips head screwdriver to remove these screws carefully. Keep the screws in a safe place so you do not lose them.

The drain pump is often secured with a few screws or a twist-lock mechanism. You may need to disconnect the drain hose and electrical wiring from the pump. The circulation pump can be more involved to remove. It might require disconnecting several hoses and wires. For specific guidance on removing this component, refer to resources on [how to remove KitchenAid dishwasher circulation pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-kitchenaid-dishwasher-circulation-pump).

Once the pumps are exposed, you can begin your visual inspection and electrical testing. Always be gentle when disconnecting hoses and wires to avoid damaging other components. Take pictures if it helps you remember how everything connects. This ensures you can put it all back together correctly later.

## Testing The KitchenAid Dishwasher Drain Pump

Testing your KitchenAid dishwasher drain pump involves checking its electrical components and looking for physical obstructions. After safely accessing the pump, disconnect the electrical connectors from the pump motor. Always ensure the power is off before touching these wires. This is a critical safety step I never skip.

First, perform a visual inspection. Check for any obvious signs of damage, like burnt wires or a cracked housing. Look into the pump impeller area for debris such as food particles, broken glass, or small utensils. Even a tiny obstruction can prevent the pump from spinning freely. You can often remove small blockages with pliers or tweezers.

Next, use your multimeter to perform a continuity test. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Î©) setting. Place one probe on each of the pump motor's terminals. A good pump motor will show a reading, typically between 10-20 ohms. If the multimeter shows an "OL" (open loop) or infinity reading, it means the motor winding is broken, and the pump needs replacement.

You can also test for resistance. The resistance value tells you about the condition of the motor windings. Refer to your dishwasher's service manual or a parts diagram for the specific resistance range for your KitchenAid drain pump. If your reading falls outside this range, the motor is likely failing. I consider this a strong indicator of a faulty pump.

Finally, if the pump passes these tests, you can test for voltage supply. Reconnect the pump's electrical wires. Turn on the dishwasher and start a drain cycle. Carefully use your multimeter to test for 120V AC at the pump's terminals while it is supposed to be running. If you get voltage but the pump does not hum or spin, the pump motor is dead. If there is no voltage, the issue might be with the control board or wiring, not the pump itself. Remember, a common symptom of issues here is [why does my KitchenAid dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom). For broader pump testing knowledge, you can also look into [how to test Whirlpool dishwasher drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-whirlpool-dishwasher-drain-pump), since KitchenAid is a Whirlpool brand.

## Testing The KitchenAid Dishwasher Circulation Pump

Testing the KitchenAid dishwasher circulation pump requires similar steps to the drain pump, but it addresses different symptoms. This pump is responsible for circulating water through the spray arms for cleaning. If your dishes are not getting clean, or you notice low water pressure in the spray arms, the circulation pump is the likely culprit. Just like with the drain pump, ensure the power is completely disconnected before you begin.

Once you have accessed the circulation pump, start with a thorough visual inspection. Look for any blockages around the impeller, which is the fan-like component that spins to move water. Food debris, broken glass, or even a piece of plastic can jam the impeller, preventing the pump from working. Clear any obstructions carefully using pliers or your fingers. Also check for signs of leaks or corrosion around the pump housing.

Next, use your multimeter to check the motor's electrical health. Disconnect the electrical connector from the circulation pump motor. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Î©) setting for a continuity test. Place one probe on each terminal of the motor. A continuous reading, typically a low resistance value, indicates a healthy motor winding. If the multimeter shows an "OL" or infinity reading, the motor winding is open, and the pump needs replacement.

You can also test the resistance of the motor windings. Consult your KitchenAid dishwasher's service manual or a reliable online resource for the specific resistance range for your circulation pump model. A reading outside this specified range indicates a failing motor. I always compare my readings to the manufacturer's specs for accuracy.

Finally, you can test for voltage supply if the pump passes the continuity and resistance tests. Reconnect the pump's electrical wires. With caution and ensuring safety, temporarily restore power to the dishwasher and start a wash cycle. Use your multimeter to check for 120V AC at the pump's terminals. If the pump receives power but does not operate, the pump motor itself is faulty. If there is no voltage, the issue lies elsewhere, possibly with the control board or wiring. If the pump is clearly struggling with debris, learning [how to clean dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-pump) can be a helpful preventative step before replacement.

## Addressing Obstructions and Minor Pump Issues

Before deciding to replace a KitchenAid dishwasher pump, check for simple obstructions or minor issues. Many pump problems are not due to a faulty motor but rather a blockage preventing it from working. This is a common and often overlooked cause. I always start with visual checks for easy fixes.

First, examine the drain filter and the sump area at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Remove the lower spray arm and the filter assembly. You will often find food debris, bits of plastic, or even small bones trapped there. Clear any visible blockages. This can dramatically improve drainage and wash performance.

Next, carefully inspect the pump impellers themselves. For the drain pump, access its impeller from the bottom of the dishwasher. For the circulation pump, you might need to remove the motor housing to reach its impeller. Look for anything wrapped around the impeller blades, like hair, string, or paper labels from dishes. Use pliers or a small tool to carefully remove these obstructions. Ensure the impeller spins freely by hand once cleared.

Check the drain hose for clogs. Disconnect the drain hose from the dishwasher and the sink drain or garbage disposal. Inspect it for kinks or blockages. You can often clear minor clogs by flushing the hose with water or using a plumber's snake. A completely blocked drain hose will prevent any water from leaving the tub, even with a working pump.

Sometimes, a pump motor hums but does not spin. This often means the motor is receiving power but cannot turn. A capacitor might be weak, or the impeller might be stuck. If you have a pump with an external capacitor, you can test it for capacitance. However, many modern dishwasher pumps have integrated capacitors, making replacement of the entire pump unit more practical. If the pump impeller is just a bit stiff, sometimes a gentle nudge can free it, but be careful not to damage it.

## When To Replace Your KitchenAid Dishwasher Pump

You have performed all the tests and troubleshooting steps. Now you need to decide if your KitchenAid dishwasher pump needs replacing. If your multimeter readings show no continuity or extremely high resistance, the motor windings are open, and the pump is dead. This is a clear sign to replace the pump. There is no repair for a burned-out motor.

Similarly, if the pump receives the correct voltage but makes no noise or motion, the internal motor has failed. This also indicates a necessary replacement. I consider these "no-brainer" scenarios for pump replacement. A pump that hums but does not move water after clearing all obstructions also likely needs replacement. The motor might be seizing up, or internal components are worn beyond repair.

Sometimes, a pump might work intermittently or make loud grinding noises. This suggests worn bearings or internal damage. While it might still operate for a short time, it will eventually fail completely. Replacing it proactively prevents future inconvenience. Listening to your dishwasher during operation can give clues about its health.

Consider the age of your dishwasher. If it is an older model and the pump fails, weigh the cost of a new pump against the cost of a new dishwasher. Pumps can be expensive, and other components might be nearing the end of their life as well. If the pump replacement cost is more than half the price of a new dishwasher, a new appliance might be a better investment.

If you are replacing the drain pump, be sure to match the part number exactly. The same goes for the circulation pump. KitchenAid dishwashers, being part of the Whirlpool family, often share pump designs with other Whirlpool brands. If you decide to tackle the replacement yourself, remember to follow safety procedures diligently. After replacing the pump, you will need to reassemble the dishwasher.
