### Can putting shoes in the washing machine break it?

Yes, putting shoes in the washing machine can break it or cause significant damage if done improperly. The weight, hard parts, and imbalance created by shoes can strain the machine's drum, motor, and internal components. This action may lead to costly repairs or a shortened appliance lifespan. Always follow safety guidelines to prevent damage.

## Understanding the Risks of Washing Shoes in a Machine

Putting shoes in a washing machine can lead to various problems. The machine spins at high speeds. Hard materials on shoes can hit the drum. This impact can cause damage over time. It is important to know these risks before you start a shoe washing cycle.

### Machine Imbalance and Vibration

Shoes are not like clothes. They often have uneven weight. When a washing machine spins, shoes can get stuck on one side of the drum. This creates an imbalance. An unbalanced load causes the machine to vibrate violently. Strong vibrations put stress on the washing machine's suspension system. This system includes springs and shock absorbers. Damage to these parts can lead to expensive repairs. It also makes the machine louder and less efficient.

### Damage to Internal Components

The drum of a washing machine moves to clean clothes. Shoes have hard soles, metal eyelets, or other rigid parts. These parts can strike the drum forcefully during agitation and spin cycles. Such impacts can dent the drum or scratch its surface. Over time, this wear can lead to rust or leaks. Small items like laces or shoe inserts might slip past the drum. They can then get caught in the drain pump or other mechanical parts. A clogged drain pump stops the machine from draining water. This requires a repair. Understanding how the [washing machine filter works](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter) can help you protect your machine's internal components.

### Drain System Clogs

Shoes can shed dirt, small stones, or bits of debris. This material can come loose during the wash cycle. It then goes into the machine's drain system. The drain pump and hoses are designed for lint and water. They are not made for solid debris. Accumulated dirt can clog the system. This prevents the machine from draining water properly. A clogged drain system can lead to water backup, foul odors, or even machine failure. Regularly [cleaning the rubber gasket in your washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.co m/how-to-clean-rubber-gasket-in-washing-machine) can also help prevent clogs and maintain hygiene.

## Types of Shoes You Can (and Can't) Wash in a Machine

Not all shoes are suitable for machine washing. The material of your shoes determines if they can withstand the wash cycle. Knowing this helps protect both your footwear and your washing machine. We will look at common shoe types.

### Washable Shoe Materials

Most athletic shoes, sneakers, and casual canvas shoes can be machine washed. Materials like cotton, nylon, and some synthetic fabrics hold up well. These materials are durable and absorb water without damage. Many running shoes or trainers fall into this category. They often get dirty from outdoor activities. My running shoes get quite muddy after a long trail run. I find that washing them correctly extends their life. Shoes with breathable mesh uppers also tend to be machine-wash friendly. For specific guidance on cleaning athletic footwear, you can learn [how to clean sneakers in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-sneakers-in-the-washing-machine). This method applies to many common sneaker types. Also, if you own Skechers, you might wonder, [can I put Skechers in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-put-skechers-in-the-washing-machine)? The answer is often yes, with proper care.

### Shoes to Avoid Machine Washing

Some shoes should never enter a washing machine. Materials like leather, suede, silk, and rubber boots can suffer damage. Leather can shrink, crack, or lose its shape. Suede can become stiff and discolored. Delicates like silk can tear. Shoes with embellishments, sequins, or delicate glued parts may fall apart. Machine washing can dissolve the glue. For example, [cleaning leather shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leather-shoes) requires a very different approach. It involves gentle cleaning products and hand-wiping. High heels, dress shoes, and specialized athletic shoes with complex support systems are also not machine-friendly. The agitation can ruin their structure.

## Preparing Shoes for the Washing Machine

Proper preparation is key to washing shoes safely. This step protects both your shoes and your appliance. Skipping these steps increases the risk of damage. I always take a few minutes for preparation before starting a wash cycle for shoes.

### Remove Laces and Inserts

Before putting shoes into the washing machine, remove their laces. Also take out any removable insoles or arch supports. Laces can tangle around the agitator or drum. This can damage the machine or the laces themselves. Insoles can shrink or get damaged during the wash. Cleaning laces and insoles separately ensures they get clean without causing issues. You can hand wash laces or put them in a small mesh bag. For more specific advice, learn [how to clean sneakers in a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-sneakers-in-washing-machine) properly.

### Pre-Clean Mud and Debris

Shoes often carry mud, dirt, and small stones. These can clog your washing machine's drain system. Before washing, knock off loose dirt. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away caked-on mud. Rinse heavily soiled areas under a faucet. This reduces the amount of debris entering the machine. It also helps your shoes get cleaner during the wash cycle. This step is crucial for preventing machine problems.

### Use a Mesh Laundry Bag

Placing shoes inside a mesh laundry bag is a must. This bag acts as a protective barrier. It prevents the shoes from banging directly against the washing machine drum. The bag also keeps laces and insoles contained if you choose to wash them with the shoes. I always use a sturdy bag designed for delicates. This simple step reduces noise and protects your machine's interior. It also keeps your shoes from getting scuffed or damaged.

### Add Towels for Balance

Washing shoes alone can cause an unbalanced load. This leads to severe vibrations. To prevent this, add a few old towels to the wash. The towels help absorb the impact of the shoes. They also distribute the load more evenly in the drum. I usually add two to four old bath towels. Make sure the towels are dark-colored. This prevents dye transfer to your shoes. The towels also act as a buffer. This protects both your shoes and your washing machine from impact. This helps [keep your shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean) throughout the wash.

## Choosing the Right Wash Settings for Shoes

Selecting the correct wash settings is crucial for safe shoe cleaning. Incorrect settings can damage both the shoes and the washing machine. I always double-check these settings before starting a load of shoes. This ensures a gentle but effective clean.

### Cold Water and Gentle Cycle

Always use cold water when washing shoes. Hot water can cause shoes to shrink, fade, or lose their shape. It can also dissolve glues in shoe construction. A gentle or delicate cycle is the best choice. This cycle uses less agitation. It mimics hand washing more closely. Low spin speeds are also important. High spin speeds put more stress on the shoes and the machine. They can also launch shoes around the drum. My preferred setting is "Delicates" with cold water and the lowest spin possible.

### Mild Detergent Only

Use a mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid powdered detergents. Powders can sometimes leave residue on shoes. Do not use too much detergent. A small amount is enough for shoes. Harsh detergents, bleach, or fabric softeners should not be used. Bleach can discolor shoes or damage materials. Fabric softener can leave a sticky residue or break down shoe components. If you are ever [cleaning your washing machine inside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-washing-machine-inside), remember that excess detergent from any wash can contribute to buildup.

### Avoid Fabric Softener

Fabric softener can damage the materials in your shoes. It can break down the adhesives that hold shoes together. It can also leave a film on the fabric. This film can attract more dirt over time. My rule is simple: never use fabric softener with shoes. It is unnecessary for cleaning shoes. It also poses a risk to their structure and appearance. Stick to just mild detergent for the best results.

## Drying Shoes Safely After Washing

Drying shoes correctly is as important as washing them properly. Improper drying can cause shrinkage, cracking, or odor problems. It can also damage your shoes' shape. Always avoid machine drying for shoes.

### Air Dry is Best

The safest way to dry shoes is to air dry them. Remove them from the mesh bag immediately after the wash cycle. Place them in a well-ventilated area. My preferred spot is outdoors on a sunny, warm day. If drying indoors, ensure good air circulation. A fan can help speed up the process. Avoid direct sunlight for prolonged periods, especially for colored shoes, as it can cause fading. This method preserves the shoe's shape and material integrity. It also prevents any heat-related damage. For a comprehensive guide on keeping shoes clean, you can also explore [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean), which often involves proper drying techniques.

### Stuff with Paper or Cloth

To help shoes maintain their shape while drying, stuff them with paper towels or old newspapers. This absorbs moisture from inside the shoe. It also helps prevent the shoe from collapsing or deforming. Change the paper or cloth frequently if the shoes are very wet. I usually check and replace the stuffing every few hours. This speeds up drying and prevents mildew. Make sure to use plain, unprinted newspaper to avoid ink transfer onto light-colored shoes. This technique is especially useful when you want to dry [white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes) without leaving any stains.

### Avoid Direct Heat

Never put shoes in a clothes dryer. The high heat from a dryer can cause significant damage. It can melt glues, shrink materials, or warp the soles. This can ruin the shoe's fit and comfort. It also creates a lot of noise as the shoes tumble around. Avoid placing shoes directly on heating vents or near radiators. The intense, localized heat can still cause material damage. Patience is key when air drying shoes. Let them dry naturally, even if it takes a day or two.

## When Hand Washing is the Better Option for Shoes

Sometimes, hand washing shoes is the safer and more effective method. Certain shoe types or levels of dirt require a gentler touch. Hand washing gives you more control over the cleaning process. I often choose hand washing for delicate or heavily soiled pairs.

### Delicate Materials

Shoes made of delicate materials benefit greatly from hand washing. Leather, suede, silk, and embellished shoes are prime candidates. Machine agitation can ruin these materials. For instance, leather can crack, and suede can get stiff. Hand washing allows you to gently clean specific areas. You can use mild cleaners designed for these materials. This prevents damage and helps maintain the shoe's original look and feel. Always check the shoe's care label if it has one.

### Heavily Stained Shoes

For shoes with stubborn or specific stains, hand washing is often more effective. A washing machine provides a general clean. It might not remove concentrated spots. With hand washing, you can pre-treat stains directly. You can use a brush to scrub affected areas with more force. This targeted approach works better for things like oil stains, grass marks, or scuffs. For example, [how to clean water shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-water-shoes) might involve hand scrubbing specific areas where sand or grime is trapped. After hand washing, you can rinse the shoe thoroughly.

### Prolonging Shoe Life

Hand washing can significantly extend the life of your shoes. Machine washing, even on a gentle cycle, can cause wear and tear over time. The constant tumbling and friction can weaken seams and materials. Hand washing is less abrasive. It puts less stress on the shoe's structure. This method helps shoes last longer and look better. If you have expensive or sentimental shoes, hand washing is a worthwhile investment of your time. This method applies to many footwear types, including specific sports shoes. If you are wondering about [can you put football boots in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-football-boots-in-the-washing-machine), hand cleaning might be a safer choice.

## Maintaining Your Washing Machine After Washing Shoes

Washing shoes in your machine requires some post-wash care for the appliance. This ensures your washing machine stays clean and functions properly. It helps prevent future issues caused by shoe debris. I make it a point to perform these maintenance steps after washing shoes.

### Check Filters and Drains

Shoes can shed dirt, small stones, or lint. These particles can accumulate in your washing machine's filter and drain pump. After washing shoes, it is wise to check these areas. Locate your machine's drain pump filter. It is usually at the bottom front of the machine. Remove any debris you find. Clear the drain hose if it appears to be clogged. This prevents blockages and ensures proper water drainage. Regular checks help maintain your machine's efficiency. Learning [how to clean your washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter) is a simple task that protects your appliance.

### Run a Cleaning Cycle

After washing dirty shoes, your washing machine drum might have residual dirt or odors. Run an empty hot water cycle with a washing machine cleaner. You can use specialized cleaners or a simple mixture of white vinegar and baking soda. This cycle flushes out any remaining grime or soap scum. It also helps sanitize the drum. For effective cleaning, consider using vinegar. You can learn [how to clean a washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-vinegar) for a natural cleaning solution. This keeps the machine fresh for your next laundry load. This is especially important for [top-loading washing machines](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-top-loading-washing-machine), which can accumulate grime over time.

### Wipe Down the Drum and Gasket

After the cleaning cycle, wipe down the inside of the washing machine drum. Use a clean cloth. Pay close attention to the rubber gasket around the door of front-loading machines. Dirt, mold, and mildew can accumulate here. A mixture of water and a mild cleaner or even just water can be effective. This step prevents odors and keeps your machine hygienic. It also extends the life of the gasket. If you notice persistent odors, you might need to learn [how to clean mold from your washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing-machine), as shoes can introduce more dirt and moisture, potentially leading to mold growth.

## FAQ Section
