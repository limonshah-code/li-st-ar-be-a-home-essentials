## Finding a 21-Inch Wide Dishwasher: Is It Made?

Welcome to our guide on compact dishwashers! Many homeowners face a common challenge: fitting essential appliances into smaller kitchens. A key question often arises when planning kitchen layouts or replacing old units: "Do they make a 21 inch wide dishwasher?" This specific dimension is quite narrow, leading many to wonder about its availability. You are looking for a compact solution, and understanding appliance dimensions is important for your space.

This article will answer that question directly. We will explore standard dishwasher sizes and common narrow options. We will also discuss alternatives for tight spaces. Furthermore, we will provide tips for measuring your area and choosing the best compact dishwasher. My goal is to help you find the right fit for your home, even with limited space.

### Takeaway:

*   Dishwashers are not typically made in a precise 21-inch width.
*   The closest common compact sizes are 18-inch and 24-inch wide units.
*   Portable and countertop dishwashers offer alternatives for very small spaces.
*   Careful measurement is key before purchasing any compact appliance.

### Is a 21-Inch Wide Dishwasher Available?

No, dishwashers are not commonly manufactured in a precise 21-inch width for residential use. Standard compact dishwashers are typically 18 inches wide. Full-size dishwashers are usually 24 inches wide. While some variations exist, 21 inches is not a standard or readily available dimension in the appliance market.

## Understanding Standard Dishwasher Sizes

When you look for a dishwasher, you find specific standard sizes. These sizes fit most kitchen designs. Knowing these dimensions helps you plan your kitchen layout. It also prevents buying an appliance that will not fit.

The most common widths for dishwashers are 18 inches and 24 inches. The 24-inch wide model is the industry standard. This size fits most homes and offers maximum capacity. It can handle dishes for a large family or for entertaining guests. If you are comparing, you can see how wide a standard size dishwasher is. This provides a baseline for your search.

Eighteen-inch dishwashers are known as compact or slimline models. They save space in smaller kitchens or apartments. While they hold fewer dishes, they offer the convenience of machine washing. These are popular for urban living or secondary kitchens. We often see these in apartments or accessory dwelling units.

There are also specialized models like dishwasher drawers. These units come in 24-inch widths but operate as one or two separate drawers. They offer flexibility for smaller loads. Some manufacturers also produce slightly larger units, such as a 23.5-inch dishwasher. These are still within the standard full-size range. You can check if [they make 23.5 inch dishwashers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-they-make-23-5-inch-dishwashers) if you have a slightly wider opening.

Understanding these standards is crucial. It helps you recognize that a 21-inch width is outside the typical manufacturing norms. This information guides your search toward available options. It ensures you select a dishwasher that actually fits your space.

## Why 21 Inches Is Not a Standard Size

The appliance industry operates on standardized dimensions. This helps manufacturers with production efficiency. It also helps builders with kitchen cabinet design. Most kitchen cabinets and appliance openings are built to accommodate these standard sizes. This makes installation easy.

Twenty-one inches does not align with these established standards. Dishwasher widths are generally multiples of 6 inches or designed around common cabinet sizes. For instance, an 18-inch dishwasher often fits into a 1.5-foot cabinet space. A 24-inch dishwasher fits a 2-foot cabinet space. This modular approach simplifies kitchen planning and construction. You can learn more about [how wide a dishwasher cabinet is](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-wide-is-a-dishwasher-cabinet) for typical installations.

Creating a 21-inch wide dishwasher would require unique cabinet configurations. This would increase manufacturing costs for the appliance. It would also increase installation costs for consumers. Such a size would not be compatible with existing kitchen designs. This would limit its market appeal significantly. Appliance makers focus on sizes that serve the largest customer base efficiently.

Furthermore, internal components and insulation impact a dishwasher's outer dimensions. Designing a 21-inch unit would present engineering challenges. It would require custom parts for a niche market. This makes it less feasible for mass production. Most manufacturers find it more practical to offer 18-inch and 24-inch models. These options cover the vast majority of consumer needs for both compact and full-sized units.

Therefore, the lack of a 21-inch wide dishwasher is a result of industry standardization. It also reflects manufacturing efficiency and market demand. You will find that companies concentrate on sizes that are most practical for everyone.

## Exploring 18-Inch Compact Dishwashers

If you are looking for a 21-inch wide dishwasher, an 18-inch compact model is likely your best alternative. These units are specifically designed for small spaces. They offer a great solution for apartments, tiny homes, or kitchens with limited cabinet width. While they are slightly narrower than your ideal 21 inches, they are the closest readily available built-in option.

Eighteen-inch dishwashers do not hold as many dishes as their 24-inch counterparts. However, they are still very efficient. They can typically wash 6 to 8 place settings. This is sufficient for one or two people, or a small family. Many models come with features similar to full-size units. These include multiple wash cycles, delay start, and energy efficiency. You can find models in various finishes to match your kitchen decor.

These compact dishwashers are built for installation under a counter. They require a dedicated water line, drain, and electrical connection. The installation process is similar to a standard dishwasher. You need to ensure proper clearance and connections. Before installing, it is also important to consider [what to put under a dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-to-put-under-dishwasher) for leak protection.

Many reputable brands offer 18-inch dishwashers. These brands include Bosch, GE, Whirlpool, and Frigidaire. Each brand offers different features and price points. Researching these options will help you find a model that fits your budget and needs. While 21 inches is not an option, an 18-inch unit can still deliver excellent performance in a small footprint.

Consider the interior capacity carefully. Think about your daily dishwashing needs. If you only wash dishes for one or two people, an 18-inch unit might be perfect. If you often entertain, you might need to run it more frequently. This is a common trade-off when choosing a compact appliance for a smaller space.

## The 24-Inch Standard: A Common Option

The 24-inch wide dishwasher is the most common size available. If your kitchen space allows, this size offers the best capacity and feature set. It fits into standard kitchen cabinetry. Builders and remodelers often plan kitchen layouts around this dimension. This makes finding a replacement or new unit easy.

These full-size dishwashers typically hold 12 to 14 place settings. This capacity is ideal for families or households that cook frequently. You can wash large pots, pans, and serving dishes with ease. This saves you time and effort compared to hand washing. Most 24-inch models come with a wide range of cycles and options. These can include sanitize cycles, bottle wash jets, and adjustable racks.

Many brands produce excellent 24-inch dishwashers. You can find models from Samsung, LG, Bosch, KitchenAid, and many others. These units come in various price ranges. They also offer different levels of quietness and energy efficiency. If you are curious about specific brands, you might wonder, for example, [does Samsung make a good dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-samsung-make-a-good-dishwasher). Researching specific brands can help you decide.

While 24 inches is wider than your desired 21 inches, it is worth considering if your layout has flexibility. Sometimes, a small cabinet modification can create the necessary space. A 24-inch dishwasher provides more utility. It also offers a wider selection of models and features. It is the go-to choice for most homes due to its balance of capacity and standard fit.

Think about the long-term use of your kitchen. If you plan to expand your family or entertain more, the extra capacity of a 24-inch unit can be very beneficial. It reduces the frequency of washes. This saves on water and energy over time.

## Alternatives for Very Small or Unique Spaces

When a built-in 18-inch or 24-inch dishwasher does not fit, other options exist. These alternatives are great for very small kitchens. They also work well for renters or those needing a temporary solution. These units do not require permanent installation into cabinetry.

### Countertop Dishwashers

Countertop dishwashers are small and sit directly on your kitchen counter. They are usually compact, measuring around 17-18 inches in height, 17-20 inches in width, and 17-22 inches in depth. They connect to your kitchen faucet for water supply. They also drain into your sink. These are perfect for single individuals or couples. They hold about 4 to 6 place settings. No installation is needed beyond connecting hoses. This makes them highly convenient and movable.

### Portable Dishwashers

Portable dishwashers are larger than countertop models. They are designed on wheels. You can roll them to your sink for use. These units connect to the faucet just like countertop models. They typically come in 18-inch and 24-inch widths. This means they match the capacity of their built-in counterparts. Once the wash cycle finishes, you can disconnect them and store them away. This frees up counter or cabinet space. They are a good choice if you lack a permanent dishwasher opening. You can find out [who makes a 22 inch wide dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/who-makes-a-22-inch-wide-dishwasher) if you need a slightly different size in a portable option, as some unique sizes exist for portable models.

### Dishwasher Drawers

Dishwasher drawers offer a unique space-saving solution. These units look like large kitchen drawers. They fit into standard 24-inch wide cabinet openings. Some models have one drawer, while others have two independent drawers. Each drawer can run its own wash cycle. This allows you to wash smaller loads without wasting water and energy. They are often found in high-end kitchens or as an additional washing solution. While they are 24 inches wide, their flexible loading capacity makes them suitable for varied needs.

These alternative dishwasher types ensure that even the smallest kitchens can enjoy the convenience of machine dishwashing. You can choose the best option based on your available space, budget, and dishwashing needs. Each type offers distinct benefits for different living situations.

## Measuring Your Space for a New Dishwasher

Accurate measurements are very important when buying a new dishwasher. Even a small error can lead to big problems. A dishwasher that does not fit means wasted time and effort. It also means the hassle of returns or costly modifications. I want to help you avoid these issues.

First, measure the width of your existing dishwasher opening. Use a tape measure. Measure from cabinet to cabinet on both sides. Take measurements at the top, middle, and bottom of the opening. Kitchen cabinets can sometimes be uneven. Always use the smallest measurement you find. This gives you the tightest fit. For standard built-in models, the typical [how wide is a standard dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-wide-is-the-standard-dishwasher) is 24 inches.

Next, measure the height. Measure from the floor to the underside of your countertop. Again, take measurements at multiple points. Look for any obstructions like pipes or electrical outlets. Dishwashers typically need about 34 to 35 inches of height.

Then, consider the depth. Measure from the front edge of your cabinet to the back wall. Also, account for the depth of the dishwasher door when open. You need enough room to fully open the door for loading and unloading dishes. Factor in space for water lines and electrical connections at the back. These connections usually require a few inches behind the unit.

Always double-check your measurements. Write them down clearly. Bring these measurements with you when you shop. Appliance salespeople can help you find models that match your exact dimensions. Remember, while a 21-inch wide dishwasher is not standard, precise measurement will confirm if an 18-inch unit or an alternative is your best choice. Taking the time to measure correctly saves you from future headaches and ensures a smooth installation process.

## Key Considerations When Buying a Compact Dishwasher

Choosing a compact dishwasher involves more than just size. Several other factors impact your satisfaction. I want to make sure you pick the right model for your home. These considerations help you make an informed decision.

**Capacity:** An 18-inch dishwasher holds fewer dishes. Consider how many people are in your household. Think about how often you cook. If you frequently entertain, even a compact model might require more frequent runs. However, for a single person or a couple, the capacity is often sufficient.

**Features and Cycles:** Despite their smaller size, many compact dishwashers offer a range of features. Look for options like multiple wash cycles (e.g., heavy, light, eco), delay start, and sanitize options. Some even have adjustable racks to accommodate taller items. Decide which features are important to you for daily use.

**Energy and Water Efficiency:** Check the Energy Star rating. Efficient models save money on utility bills over time. They also reduce your environmental footprint. Look for the estimated annual energy consumption. Water usage per cycle is also important. Manufacturers are always improving efficiency, so newer models tend to be better.

**Noise Level (dB):** Dishwashers can be noisy. This is especially true in open-concept living spaces. Look for the decibel (dB) rating. Lower numbers mean quieter operation. A dishwasher running at 45 dB or lower is considered very quiet. If your kitchen is near a living area, a quiet model is a good investment.

**Installation Requirements:** Built-in compact dishwashers need permanent plumbing and electrical connections. Portable and countertop models offer more flexibility. They often connect to your sink faucet. Understand what your chosen model requires for installation. You might need professional help for built-in units. You can also research [how to take out a dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-take-out-a-dishwasher) if you are replacing an old unit.

**Budget:** Compact dishwashers vary in price. Set a budget before you start shopping. Factor in the cost of installation if needed. Remember that investing in a slightly more expensive, energy-efficient, or quieter model can pay off in the long run.

By considering these points, you can choose a compact dishwasher that fits your space and meets your needs. It is about finding the right balance between size, performance, and features.

## Professional Installation and Maintenance Tips

Getting your dishwasher installed correctly is as important as choosing the right one. Proper installation ensures efficient operation and prevents issues. Following good maintenance practices also extends your appliance's life.

### Professional Installation Benefits

While some homeowners might attempt DIY installation, professional installation is often recommended. Installers ensure all connections are secure. They properly connect water supply lines, drain hoses, and electrical wiring. This prevents leaks, electrical hazards, and drainage problems. A professional also ensures the unit is level and securely anchored. This prevents tipping and reduces noise during operation. They are familiar with local building codes. This guarantees your installation meets safety standards. If you are unsure about [how to make your Frigidaire dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-your-frigidaire-dishwasher-drain) after installation, a professional can also provide guidance or troubleshooting.

### Regular Maintenance for Longevity

Regular maintenance helps your dishwasher perform its best. It also prevents costly repairs. Here are some simple tips:

*   **Clean the Filter:** Most dishwashers have a filter at the bottom. This filter collects food particles. Check and clean it regularly, usually once a month. This prevents clogs and ensures proper draining.
*   **Wipe Down the Interior:** After each use, wipe down the interior and door seal. This removes food residue and prevents mold or mildew buildup.
*   **Run Hot Water Before Use:** Before starting a cycle, run hot water at your kitchen sink for a minute. This ensures hot water enters the dishwasher from the start. Hot water helps detergent dissolve better and improves cleaning.
*   **Use Dishwasher Cleaner:** Periodically run an empty cycle with a specialized dishwasher cleaner. This helps remove hard water deposits and grease. You can also use white vinegar.
*   **Check Spray Arms:** Make sure the spray arm holes are not clogged. Food particles can block them, reducing cleaning effectiveness. Use a toothpick to clear any blockages.
*   **Load Correctly:** Avoid overcrowding the dishwasher. Proper loading allows water and detergent to reach all surfaces. This ensures thorough cleaning.

By following these tips, your compact dishwasher will serve you well for many years. Regular care keeps it running efficiently and effectively. It also helps avoid common issues like poor drainage or cleaning performance.
