## Understanding Why Cats Explore Cabinets

Cats possess a natural instinct for exploration and hunting. They see cabinets as dark, enclosed spaces. These spaces often resemble caves or hideouts in the wild. This makes cabinets appealing to their natural instincts. Inside, they might find interesting textures, smells, or even moving objects.

This exploration instinct can become a problem quickly. Cats do not know what is dangerous. They can chew on electrical cords, ingest toxic substances, or get trapped. Protecting your cat means understanding their motives. Then, you can address their behavior safely.
