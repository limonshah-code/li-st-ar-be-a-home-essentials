## Master Your Ring: How to Reset Ring Doorbell on App for Peak Performance

Is your Ring Doorbell acting up? Perhaps it is not sending notifications, showing a poor video feed, or struggling with its connection. These common frustrations can disrupt your home security. Knowing how to reset your Ring Doorbell on the app becomes essential. I will guide you through the process step-by-step. This article explains the reasons for a reset, details the specific actions within the Ring app, and covers post-reset setup procedures.

### Takeaway:

*   Resetting your Ring Doorbell through the app resolves common performance issues.
*   It improves device connectivity and prepares the doorbell for new network settings.
*   This process often involves removing the device from your account for a fresh start.

To reset your Ring Doorbell via the app, you primarily remove the device from your Ring account within the app's settings. This action unlinks the doorbell from your profile. It allows for a fresh setup, much like reinstalling software. A physical factory reset button on the doorbell itself is sometimes needed for more severe issues.

### Understanding Why You Need to Reset Your Ring Doorbell via the App

You might ask, "Why do I need to reset my Ring Doorbell?" Many common problems cause frustration. Your device might go offline often. It might fail to send timely notifications to your phone. Sometimes, the video feed becomes inconsistent or completely black and white. These issues often relate to connectivity or software glitches.

Resetting your Ring Doorbell through the app helps resolve these problems. This action clears old settings and establishes a fresh connection. It acts like a digital refresh button for your device. A reset can often fix a slow or unresponsive doorbell. It improves overall device performance.

There is a difference between an app-based reset and a physical factory reset. An app-based reset primarily involves removing the device from your Ring account. This unlinks it from your profile and current settings. A physical factory reset wipes all data from the device itself. It returns the doorbell to its original factory state. Both methods prepare the doorbell for a fresh setup. The app method is often the first, less drastic step. If your doorbell is not notifying you, a reset can help. You can learn more about notification issues here: [Why is My Ring Doorbell Not Notifying Me?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ring-doorbell-not-notifying-me). Sometimes, the doorbell might even ring by itself, which indicates a software or sensor issue. See how to address this here: [Why Does My Doorbell Ring by Itself?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-doorbell-ring-by-itself).

### Preparing for an App-Based Ring Doorbell Reset

Before you begin the reset process, some preparation helps. First, ensure your Ring Doorbell has sufficient power. If it is battery-powered, check its charge level. A low battery can cause connectivity problems and interfere with the reset. For wired doorbells, confirm the power supply is stable.

Second, check your home Wi-Fi network. A strong, stable Wi-Fi signal is critical for your doorbell's operation. Make sure your router is working correctly. Consider moving closer to the router if the signal is weak. Poor Wi-Fi can prevent a successful reconnection after a reset.

Third, update your Ring App to the latest version. Developers constantly release updates. These updates include bug fixes and performance improvements. An outdated app can cause unexpected issues during device management. Visit your phone's app store to check for updates. Finally, have your Wi-Fi network name and password ready. You will need these details to reconnect your doorbell after the reset. This preparation ensures a smooth process.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Removing Your Ring Doorbell from the App

The main way to "reset Ring Doorbell on app" involves removing the device from your Ring account. This process unlinks the doorbell. It allows you to set it up again as a new device. It is a soft reset that often resolves minor glitches. I will walk you through each step.

Here is how to remove your Ring Doorbell from the app:

1.  **Open the Ring App:** Launch the Ring application on your smartphone or tablet. Make sure you are logged into the correct Ring account. This account should be the one linked to your doorbell.
2.  **Access Devices Section:** On the dashboard, you will see a list of your Ring devices. Find your Ring Doorbell in this list. Tap on its icon to select it. This action opens the device dashboard for your specific doorbell.
3.  **Go to Device Settings:** On the device dashboard, look for the "Device Settings" option. It usually appears as a gear icon or a specific menu item. Tap on it to access various configuration options.
4.  **Find General Settings:** Within Device Settings, locate "General Settings." This section contains core information about your device. It includes options for device removal.
5.  **Remove This Device:** Scroll down within General Settings. You will find an option labeled "Remove This Device" or similar wording. Tap on this option. Be careful, as this action cannot be undone easily.
6.  **Confirm Removal:** The app will prompt you to confirm your decision. Read the warning message carefully. Confirm that you want to remove the doorbell from your account. This step completes the app-based reset. Your doorbell is now unlinked.

Removing the device does not erase its internal firmware. It simply dissociates it from your account. You can then add it back as a new device. This process is crucial for troubleshooting or transferring ownership. Many Ring app functions, like ringing your doorbell from the app, rely on proper device linking. Explore how to do that here: [How to Ring Doorbell on Ring App](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-ring-doorbell-on-ring-app). Understanding how your doorbell connects to the app helps with troubleshooting. You can also check if you can trigger the doorbell sound directly from the app: [Can I Ring My Doorbell From My Ring App?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-ring-my-doorbell-from-my-ring-app). Remember, your Ring Doorbell can send notifications to your phone, but it is not the only device it rings on.

### Reconnecting Your Ring Doorbell After App Removal

After you remove your Ring Doorbell from the app, it is ready for a fresh setup. This is like installing a new device. Reconnecting it is a straightforward process. I will show you how to add your doorbell back to your Ring account. This step is necessary to restore its functionality.

Follow these steps to reconnect your Ring Doorbell:

1.  **Open the Ring App:** Launch the Ring application on your device again. Log in if you are not already.
2.  **Tap 'Set Up a Device':** On the app's dashboard, look for the "Set Up a Device" option. It often appears as a plus (+) icon or a direct button. Tap this to begin the setup wizard.
3.  **Select 'Doorbells':** The app will ask you to choose the type of device you are setting up. Select "Doorbells" from the list.
4.  **Scan the QR Code:** The app will instruct you to scan the QR code on your Ring Doorbell. This code is usually found on the back of the device. If you have removed the doorbell for maintenance, this is easy. If it is still mounted, find the QR code on the original packaging or in the device's manual. A 5-digit PIN might also be available if the QR code is inaccessible.
5.  **Connect to Ring Temporary Network:** Your phone will now try to connect to a temporary Wi-Fi network broadcast by your Ring Doorbell. This network usually starts with "RING-" followed by numbers. Follow the on-screen prompts to join this network.
6.  **Connect to Home Wi-Fi:** Once connected to the Ring network, the app will ask you to select your home Wi-Fi network. Choose your preferred 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz network. Enter your Wi-Fi password carefully. This step connects your doorbell to your internet.
7.  **Name Your Device:** The app will then ask you to give your doorbell a name. Choose a name that helps you identify it easily. For example, "Front Door" or "Main Entrance."
8.  **Test the Connection:** After naming, the setup is complete. The app will confirm the successful connection. Test your doorbell by pressing its button. Check if you receive a notification. Verify the video feed works correctly. This process is similar to setting up a new Ring doorbell that is already installed.

### When to Consider a Physical Factory Reset for Your Ring Doorbell

While removing your Ring Doorbell from the app performs a type of software reset, sometimes you need a deeper solution. A physical factory reset is necessary in certain situations. This action completely wipes all settings from the doorbell. It returns the device to its default, out-of-the-box state.

Consider a physical factory reset if:

*   **App Reset Fails:** You tried removing the device from the app and re-adding it, but the issues persist. This suggests a deeper problem not resolved by a simple unlinking.
*   **Selling or Gifting the Device:** You plan to sell or give away your Ring Doorbell. A factory reset ensures all your personal data is removed. It makes the device ready for a new owner. They can then set it up from scratch.
*   **Persistent Performance Issues:** Your doorbell constantly exhibits problems like freezing, extreme battery drain, or complete unresponsiveness. A factory reset can fix corrupted firmware or persistent software bugs.

The process for a physical reset varies slightly by Ring Doorbell model. Most models have a small button, usually located on the back or side. You might need a paperclip or a small tool to press it. You typically hold this button down for 15-20 seconds. The light ring on the front of the doorbell will flash. It eventually performs a complete cycle to indicate the reset is complete. After a physical factory reset, you must set up the device again as if it were brand new. This includes connecting it to your Wi-Fi and linking it to your Ring account. If your existing doorbell chime works with Ring, a factory reset might require re-establishing that connection.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues During Ring Doorbell Reset

Resetting your Ring Doorbell generally goes smoothly. However, you might encounter some common issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems helps. I want you to feel confident resolving any hiccups.

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

*   **Doorbell Not Appearing in App After Removal:** If you remove the device but it does not appear when trying to set up a new one, first restart your phone. Then, close and reopen the Ring app. Sometimes, a simple app refresh solves this. Ensure your phone's Bluetooth is on, as some setup processes use it.
*   **Connection Failure During Setup:** This is often a Wi-Fi issue. Double-check your Wi-Fi password. Passwords are case-sensitive. Ensure you are connecting to the correct network. Your Ring Doorbell typically connects to 2.4 GHz networks. Some models also support 5 GHz. Try moving your router closer to the doorbell temporarily.
*   **Error Messages During Reset:** Pay attention to any specific error codes or messages. These provide clues about the problem. A common message might relate to network issues. Try power cycling your Wi-Fi router. Unplug it for 30 seconds, then plug it back in. This refreshes your network.
*   **Doorbell Doesn't Power On After Reset:** If your battery-powered doorbell does not power on, fully charge its battery. For wired doorbells, check the wiring connections. Ensure the transformer provides enough power. You might need a multimeter to test voltage.
*   **Poor Video Quality After Reset:** If your video appears black and white or distorted, it might be due to low light or a night vision setting. However, persistent poor quality after a reset could indicate a hardware issue or a weak Wi-Fi signal. Check your Wi-Fi signal strength in the Ring app's Device Health section. If your Ring doorbell is black and white, learn more about it here: [Why is Ring Doorbell Black and White?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-ring-doorbell-black-and-white). Sometimes, a doorbell might go off on its own, which could be a sign of a sensor issue that a full reset might help with. More on this here: [Can Ring Doorbell Go Off On Its Own?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-ring-doorbell-go-off-on-its-own).

If you have tried all troubleshooting steps and still face issues, contact Ring customer support. They can provide specific guidance for your doorbell model.

### Maintaining Your Ring Doorbell's Performance Post-Reset

You have successfully reset and reconnected your Ring Doorbell. Now, let's talk about keeping it running smoothly. Regular maintenance prevents future problems. This ensures your home security stays reliable. I always recommend these practices to maximize your device's lifespan and performance.

Here are key maintenance tips:

*   **Regular App Updates:** Always keep your Ring App updated. New versions often fix bugs and improve stability. They also introduce new features. Enable automatic updates on your phone to stay current.
*   **Strong Wi-Fi Signal:** Monitor your doorbell's Wi-Fi signal strength. The Ring app's Device Health section shows this. A weak signal causes disconnects and poor performance. Consider a Wi-Fi extender if your doorbell is far from your router.
*   **Check Device Health Regularly:** Periodically review the "Device Health" section in your Ring App. It provides insights into battery life, Wi-Fi signal strength, and firmware version. This helps you catch issues early.
*   **Clean the Lens and Exterior:** Dust and dirt can accumulate on the doorbell's camera lens. Use a soft, damp cloth to gently clean it. This ensures clear video quality. Wipe down the entire exterior to keep it looking good.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Ring automatically pushes firmware updates to your doorbell. Ensure your doorbell remains powered on and connected to Wi-Fi for these updates to install. Firmware updates improve functionality and patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Consider Ring Protect Plan:** A Ring Protect subscription offers cloud video recording and other benefits. It ensures your recordings are saved even if your doorbell goes offline. This plan provides an added layer of security and convenience.

These simple steps keep your Ring Doorbell in top shape. They help prevent the need for frequent resets. A well-maintained doorbell offers peace of mind.

### FAQ Section

#### How do I hard reset my Ring Doorbell without the app?

To hard reset your Ring Doorbell without the app, locate the physical reset button on the device. This button is usually on the back or side. For battery-powered models, you may need to remove the faceplate. Press and hold this button for 15-20 seconds. The light ring will flash, indicating a successful factory reset.

#### Does resetting Ring Doorbell delete recordings?

Resetting your Ring Doorbell does not delete recordings stored in the cloud. If you have a Ring Protect Plan, your recorded videos remain accessible in your Ring account through the app. However, a factory reset will erase any local settings or stored Wi-Fi credentials from the device itself.

#### How long does a Ring Doorbell reset take?

Removing your Ring Doorbell from the app takes only a few seconds. Re-adding it can take 2-5 minutes, depending on your Wi-Fi setup process. A physical factory reset, including the button hold and subsequent setup, might take 5-10 minutes. The entire process is usually quite quick.

#### Why won't my Ring Doorbell connect to Wi-Fi after reset?

Your Ring Doorbell might not connect to Wi-Fi after a reset due to an incorrect Wi-Fi password. Double-check your network name and password during setup. Network interference or an unstable Wi-Fi signal can also cause issues. Try restarting your Wi-Fi router. Ensure your doorbell is within good range of your router.

#### What's the difference between removing a device and factory resetting it?

Removing a device from the app unlinks it from your Ring account. This is a software action. It keeps existing device settings but allows for re-assignment. A factory reset, usually via a physical button, wipes all data and settings from the device itself. It restores the doorbell to its original manufacturer state.
