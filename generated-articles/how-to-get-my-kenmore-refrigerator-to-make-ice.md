## How To Get My Kenmore Refrigerator To Make Ice

Imagine a warm day. You reach for your Kenmore refrigerator, ready to grab some ice for a refreshing drink. But the ice dispenser is silent. The ice bucket sits empty. This is a common problem many Kenmore owners face. I understand how frustrating it feels when your trusty appliance stops performing a basic function.

A Kenmore refrigerator not making ice is usually due to a few common culprits. These issues often relate to water supply, temperature settings, or the ice maker assembly itself. We will explore each potential problem methodically. This guide will help you diagnose the issue. You will learn the steps to restore ice production. Let's get your Kenmore refrigerator making ice again.

### Takeaway

Getting your Kenmore refrigerator to make ice again often involves simple troubleshooting steps.
*   Check basic settings like power and the ice maker switch.
*   Verify the water supply and filter condition.
*   Inspect the ice maker assembly for jams or defects.
*   Ensure the freezer temperature is correct.
*   Perform a manual reset or thaw any frozen components.
*   Regular maintenance prevents future issues.

### Clear Answer

To get your Kenmore refrigerator making ice, first check the ice maker's power, switch, and water supply valve. Ensure the freezer temperature is set between 0°F and 5°F. Inspect the water filter and water line for clogs or freezes. Finally, reset the ice maker or manually clear any ice jams within the assembly.

## Starting Simple: Basic Checks for Your Kenmore Refrigerator Ice Maker

When your Kenmore refrigerator stops making ice, start with the easiest checks. These initial steps often solve the problem quickly. They do not require tools or technical knowledge. Skipping these steps can lead to unnecessary repairs.

First, check if the refrigerator is plugged in and receiving power. Sometimes, a tripped circuit breaker can cut power to the appliance. Go to your electrical panel and reset any tripped breakers. Ensure the power cord is firmly seated in the outlet. A loose plug prevents the refrigerator from operating correctly. This simple check can save you time and effort.

Next, locate the ice maker's ON/OFF switch. This switch is typically a wire arm or a toggle switch on the ice maker assembly. People sometimes accidentally bump this arm up or switch it off during cleaning or stocking groceries. If the arm is in the "off" position (usually up), lower it. If it is a toggle switch, flip it to the "on" position. The ice maker needs this switch to be on to function.

Confirm that the water supply valve to your refrigerator is open. This valve is usually behind the refrigerator or under the sink. A partially closed valve restricts water flow. No water means no ice. Turn the valve fully counter-clockwise to ensure it is open. You should also check the main house water supply. Sometimes, general water pressure issues affect appliance function.

Lastly, inspect the freezer temperature setting. The freezer must be cold enough for water to freeze quickly. An ideal temperature for ice production is between 0°F (-18°C) and 5°F (-15°C). If the freezer is too warm, the ice maker cannot freeze water effectively. Adjust the temperature if necessary and allow several hours for ice production to resume. A full ice bucket can also trick the ice maker into stopping production. Ensure the bucket is not overflowing or preventing the control arm from moving.

## Water Flow Problems: Kenmore Refrigerator Ice Maker Water Supply

A common reason a Kenmore refrigerator stops making ice is an issue with the water supply. The ice maker needs a consistent flow of clean water. Several components work together to deliver water to the ice mold. Problems with any of these parts stop ice production. Understanding these parts helps you pinpoint the problem.

The water filter is often the first place to check. Kenmore refrigerators use a water filter to ensure clean drinking water and clear ice. Over time, this filter collects sediment and minerals. A clogged filter restricts water flow significantly. This means the ice maker receives little or no water. Most manufacturers recommend changing the filter every six months. If you cannot remember the last change, replacing it is a good first step. I have found this simple fix solves many "no ice" problems. You can learn [how to change the water filter on your Kenmore bottom freezer refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-water-filter-on-kenmore-bottom-freezer-refrigerator) easily.

Next, inspect the water supply line itself. This is the narrow tube that carries water from your home's water supply to the refrigerator. It can become kinked or frozen. A kinked line blocks water flow. You might find a kink if the refrigerator was recently moved. Straighten any bends you find. A frozen water line is another common issue. This often happens in the line inside the freezer door or in the back of the freezer compartment. You can gently thaw a frozen line using a hairdryer on a low setting. Direct the warm air at the suspected frozen area. Be careful not to use too much heat. This can damage plastic components. For a thorough cleaning, you might want to learn [how to clean your refrigerator ice maker water line](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-refrigerator-ice-maker-water-line).

The water inlet valve controls water flow into the ice maker. This valve is typically at the back of the refrigerator, near the water line connection. It is an electrical component. It opens when the ice maker signals for water. If this valve fails, water cannot enter the ice maker. You can often hear a buzzing sound when it tries to open. If you do not hear it, or if you suspect it is faulty, it might need testing with a multimeter. A professional appliance technician can test and replace a faulty water inlet valve if necessary.

Finally, consider your home's water pressure. Low water pressure can prevent the inlet valve from opening fully. It can also lead to smaller, misshapen ice cubes. If other water fixtures in your home also have low pressure, the issue might be with your main water supply. Contact your water utility provider if you suspect a home-wide pressure problem. Ensuring good water pressure is vital for consistent ice production.

## Inside the Machine: Kenmore Ice Maker Assembly Troubleshooting

If water flows to your Kenmore ice maker but it still produces no ice, the problem likely lies within the ice maker assembly itself. This is the unit responsible for freezing water and ejecting ice cubes. Many small parts work together. One faulty component can stop the entire process. A systematic check of these parts will help you diagnose the issue.

First, check the ice maker's control arm. This metal or plastic arm senses when the ice bin is full. If the ice bin is full, the arm moves up, stopping ice production. Sometimes, ice cubes can jam this arm in the "up" position, even if the bin is empty. Gently push the arm down to ensure it moves freely. Clear any ice that is blocking its path. If the arm is broken or bent, it might need replacement. This arm tells the ice maker when to stop and start.

Next, inspect the ice mold itself for any obstructions. The ice mold is where water fills and freezes into cubes. Old, stuck ice cubes or debris can prevent new water from filling the mold. They can also stop the ejector from rotating properly. Use a plastic utensil or your fingers to carefully clear any stuck ice or foreign objects. Do not use sharp metal objects. These can damage the mold.

The ejector motor and gears are crucial for pushing ice out of the mold. If you hear a humming or buzzing sound but no ice is ejected, the motor might be trying to work. It could be stripped gears or a burnt-out motor. Sometimes, the ejector arm itself breaks. You can often see the ejector arm if you look closely at the ice maker. If it is visibly broken or bent, it needs replacement. This repair usually involves replacing the entire ice maker module.

Many Kenmore ice makers use an optical sensor, or "eye," to detect ice levels. These sensors are small infrared emitters and receivers, usually located on the side walls of the freezer, near the ice maker. If these sensors become dirty, obstructed, or faulty, the ice maker believes the bin is full. This stops production. Clean the sensor lenses with a damp cloth. Make sure no ice cubes or debris block the beam between them. If cleaning does not help, the sensors might be defective. Replacing these sensors can be tricky for a DIY repair person.

Lastly, the mold thermostat plays a critical role. This thermostat senses when the ice in the mold is fully frozen. It then signals the ejector to start. If the thermostat fails, the ice maker might not recognize that the ice is ready. It will not eject. This results in the ice sitting in the mold. Testing this component often requires a multimeter and some electrical knowledge. If you are not comfortable with electrical tests, a professional can help.

## Temperature Matters: Ensuring Proper Freezer Conditions for Ice

The freezer temperature is paramount for effective ice production in your Kenmore refrigerator. If the freezer is not cold enough, the water in the ice maker mold will not freeze properly or quickly. This leads to slow ice production or no ice at all. It is important to maintain the correct temperature settings and ensure the freezer environment supports freezing.

The ideal temperature for a refrigerator freezer to make ice efficiently is between 0°F (-18°C) and 5°F (-15°C). Check your refrigerator's temperature display or use a separate freezer thermometer to verify the temperature. If it is higher, adjust the thermostat setting downwards. Give the freezer several hours to stabilize at the new temperature. A common misconception is that colder is always better. However, temperatures significantly below 0°F generally do not improve ice production speed much. They just use more energy.

Poor door seals can cause temperature fluctuations inside the freezer. Over time, door gaskets can become brittle, cracked, or loose. This allows warm air to leak into the freezer compartment. Warm air increases the internal temperature and introduces humidity. Humidity can lead to excessive frost buildup, which further hinders cooling and ice production. Check your door seals by closing the door on a piece of paper. If you can easily pull the paper out, the seal is likely faulty. Replacing worn-out door gaskets is a relatively simple repair.

Overloading the freezer can also impact its cooling performance. A freezer packed too tightly restricts airflow around items. This prevents the cold air from circulating evenly. Proper air circulation is essential for the ice maker to freeze water effectively. Try to leave some space between items for air to move freely. Keeping the freezer moderately full, however, can actually help maintain stable temperatures. Frozen items act as thermal masses.

The condenser coils, usually located at the bottom or back of your Kenmore refrigerator, are crucial for heat dissipation. If these coils are covered in dust, pet hair, or debris, the refrigerator struggles to release heat efficiently. This forces the compressor to work harder, leading to higher freezer temperatures. You should clean these coils every 6-12 months. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove accumulated dust. This simple maintenance step significantly improves cooling performance. It also helps your refrigerator use less energy. If your Kenmore refrigerator is not cooling properly, this could be a root cause affecting ice production. You can read more about [why your Kenmore bottom freezer refrigerator might not be cooling](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-bottom-freezer-refrigerator-not-cooling).

Finally, ensure the evaporator fan is working correctly. This fan circulates cold air throughout the freezer compartment. If the fan motor fails or is blocked by ice, cold air will not reach the ice maker effectively. You can often hear the fan running when the freezer door is closed. If you hear no fan noise or if the freezer seems unevenly cold, the evaporator fan might be the issue. Accessing this fan typically requires removing panels inside the freezer. This is a more advanced repair.

## Reset and Thaw: Reviving Your Kenmore Refrigerator Ice Maker

When your Kenmore refrigerator ice maker stops producing ice, performing a reset or thorough thawing can often solve the problem. These methods clear minor glitches. They also resolve issues caused by ice buildup. These are often easy DIY steps that save a service call.

Many Kenmore ice makers have a manual reset button. This button is usually red or black. It is located on the side or underside of the ice maker assembly. Press and hold this button for 3-5 seconds. You might hear the ice maker cycle through its motions. It will typically fill with water after a few minutes. This reset can clear minor electronic errors. It tells the ice maker to restart its cycle. Always check your specific model's manual for the exact location and procedure for the reset button.

If your ice maker does not have a visible reset button, you can perform a power cycle reset. This involves unplugging the refrigerator from the wall outlet. Wait for about 5-10 minutes. Then, plug it back in. This action is similar to restarting a computer. It clears the control board's memory. This often resolves electronic glitches that cause the ice maker to stop working. After plugging it back in, give the refrigerator several hours. The ice maker needs time to cool down and start its first ice production cycle.

A common problem is a frozen ice maker or a frozen water line within the ice maker. Water can freeze in the mold. It can also freeze in the fill tube. This prevents new water from entering or existing ice from ejecting. To thaw a frozen ice maker, turn off the ice maker or unplug the refrigerator. Use a hairdryer on a low setting. Direct warm air at the ice maker assembly. Be careful not to hold the hairdryer too close or use excessive heat. This can melt plastic components. Alternatively, place a bowl of hot water inside the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. The steam helps to melt the ice. You can also use a warm, damp cloth to wipe down frozen areas. Once thawed, ensure all water is wiped up. This prevents immediate refreezing.

Sometimes, large clumps of ice can form in the ice bucket or around the ice maker mechanism. These clumps can jam the ejector arm. They can also block the dispenser chute. Manually remove any large ice clumps from the bin. Break up any smaller pieces that are sticking together. Ensure the ice bucket fits correctly back into its position. An improperly seated bucket can also interfere with the ice maker's function. Clear any ice that is stuck in the dispenser chute. You can often use a wooden spoon or similar object to dislodge ice from the chute.

After performing a reset or thaw, allow ample time for the ice maker to resume normal operation. It can take several hours, sometimes up to 24 hours, for the first batch of ice to be made. This waiting period is normal. The freezer needs to reach its optimal temperature. The ice maker also needs to cycle through its initial water fill and freeze stages. Patience is key after troubleshooting these issues.

## Advanced Solutions: Deeper Dives into Kenmore Ice Maker Repairs

When basic troubleshooting and resets do not bring back ice production, it might be time for deeper diagnostics. These steps involve testing specific components. They often require a multimeter and a basic understanding of electrical circuits. If you are uncomfortable with these steps, consider calling a professional.

Testing the water inlet valve is a crucial step. This valve controls water flow into the ice maker. First, disconnect power to the refrigerator. Locate the water inlet valve at the back of the unit. Disconnect the electrical connector. Use a multimeter to check for continuity across the solenoid terminals. A lack of continuity indicates a faulty solenoid coil. You can also test if the valve is receiving proper voltage. Have someone turn on the water dispenser while you test the voltage at the valve's terminals with the power on. Be extremely careful when testing live electrical circuits. If no voltage is present, the issue might be with the main control board or wiring.

The ice maker's ejector motor and gears can fail. This motor rotates the ejector arms to push ice cubes out. To test the motor, you typically need to remove the ice maker assembly. Once removed, you can sometimes test the motor's continuity directly. If the motor is getting power but not turning, it is likely faulty. Often, the entire ice maker module is replaced if the motor fails. The gears within the module can also strip or break, preventing the ejector from working. Visually inspect the gears for any signs of damage.

The mold thermostat, also known as a bimetal thermostat or freezer thermostat, is embedded in the ice mold. It signals the ice maker to eject ice when the water is sufficiently frozen. To test it, you usually need to remove the ice maker. Use a multimeter to check for continuity across its terminals. The thermostat should have continuity when it is cold (below freezing point) and open continuity when warm. You can place it in a glass of ice water to test it when cold. If it does not show continuity when cold, it is likely defective.

Kenmore refrigerators often use optical sensors (or "ice level control board") to detect the ice level in the bin. These sensors are small circuit boards with infrared emitters and receivers. They are usually found on the side walls of the freezer compartment, near the ice maker. If these sensors are dirty, misaligned, or faulty, the ice maker will not produce ice. Clean them first with a soft cloth. If cleaning does not resolve the issue, you may need to test the continuity of the sensors. Replacing these boards can be complex. They are often sold as a pair.

Accessing service manuals for your specific Kenmore model can provide detailed diagnostic steps and wiring diagrams. These manuals show component locations and how to test them. They are invaluable for advanced troubleshooting. You can often find these manuals online. Search using your refrigerator's model number. Remember to always disconnect power before attempting any electrical tests or repairs. Safety should be your top priority when working with appliances. If any of these advanced steps feel beyond your comfort level, contact a certified technician.

## Maintenance for Consistent Kenmore Ice Production

Regular maintenance is key to keeping your Kenmore refrigerator making ice consistently. Many "no ice" problems arise from neglect. Simple, routine checks and cleaning prevent future breakdowns. Incorporating these tasks into your home maintenance schedule can save you money and inconvenience.

Regularly cleaning your ice maker components is essential. Over time, mineral deposits and slime can build up in the ice mold and water lines. This buildup affects ice quality and can clog the system. Turn off the ice maker or unplug the refrigerator. Remove the ice bucket. Wash it with warm, soapy water. Dry it completely. For the ice maker assembly itself, wipe down accessible parts with a damp cloth. Do not use abrasive cleaners. They can damage plastic. You can find detailed steps on [how to clean your refrigerator ice maker](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-refrigerator-ice-maker) thoroughly. This prevents future issues.

Timely water filter replacement is another critical maintenance task. Kenmore recommends changing your refrigerator's water filter every six months. A clogged filter restricts water flow to the ice maker. This results in small, misshapen cubes or no ice production. Even if water still flows, a heavily used filter might not purify water effectively. Check your refrigerator's display for a "change filter" indicator. Even without an indicator, stick to the six-month schedule. It ensures a consistent supply of clean water for ice.

Keeping your freezer organized also helps with ice production. An overly full freezer restricts proper air circulation. Cold air needs to move freely around the ice maker for efficient freezing. Avoid packing items tightly against the back wall or the ice maker itself. Leave some space for air to flow. Also, remove any ice that spills from the bucket and freezes at the bottom of the freezer. This prevents larger ice blockages.

Check the refrigerator and freezer door seals regularly. Worn or dirty door gaskets allow warm, moist air to enter the compartments. This increases internal temperatures and causes frost buildup. Frost can impede the ice maker's function. Clean the door seals with warm, soapy water. Inspect them for cracks or tears. If seals are damaged, replace them to maintain an airtight seal. A good seal keeps cold air in.

Finally, clean the condenser coils. These coils are usually at the bottom or back of your Kenmore refrigerator. They are vital for the refrigerator
