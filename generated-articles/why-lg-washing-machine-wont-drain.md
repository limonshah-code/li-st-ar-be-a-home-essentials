## LG Washing Machine Won't Drain? Here's Why!

A washing machine that refuses to drain water is a frustrating problem. You expect clean clothes, but instead, you find a tub full of stagnant water. If your LG washing machine won't drain, you are not alone. This is a common issue for many homeowners. Understanding the reasons behind this problem helps you fix it faster. I will guide you through the likely culprits and simple steps to get your LG washer working correctly again. This guide provides clear solutions for common drainage failures.

**Takeaway:**
*   Check the drain hose for kinks or blockages.
*   Clean the drain pump filter regularly.
*   Inspect the drain pump for foreign objects.
*   Test the lid switch or door latch on top-loaders and front-loaders.
*   Confirm the proper installation height of the drain hose.

When your LG washing machine will not drain, it usually means something blocks the water flow or a part has failed. Common causes include a clogged drain pump filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, or a malfunctioning drain pump. Other issues can involve the lid switch, main control board, or problems with the house drain itself.

## Understanding the Drain Cycle in Your LG Washing Machine

Your LG washing machine follows a specific sequence during a wash cycle. After washing and rinsing clothes, the machine enters the drain cycle. The drain pump activates, pulling water from the tub through the drain hose. This water then exits into your laundry sink or a standpipe. Proper water flow is crucial for effective draining. Any disruption in this flow prevents the machine from emptying. I find it helpful to understand this basic process before looking for specific faults.

When the drain cycle begins, the machine sends a signal to the drain pump. The pump motor spins, creating suction. This suction pulls water from the bottom of the wash tub. The water travels through internal hoses, passes through a filter, and then exits the machine via the main drain hose. If any part of this system fails or becomes blocked, water remains in the tub. Your LG washer needs a clear path to drain all the dirty water.

## Clogged Drain Pump Filter: A Common Reason for No Drain

One of the most frequent reasons an LG washing machine won't drain is a clogged drain pump filter. This filter, sometimes called a coin trap, catches lint, coins, buttons, and other small items that come off clothes. Over time, these items build up and block water from reaching the drain pump. When the filter is severely clogged, water cannot pass through, and the machine will not drain properly. You must clean this filter regularly to prevent drainage issues.

### Locating and Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter is typically located at the bottom front of your LG washing machine. It is usually behind a small access panel or door. You might need a screwdriver to open the panel. Before opening, place towels on the floor and have a shallow pan ready. A good amount of water will come out when you open the filter. This water comes from the pump housing.

To clean the filter:

1.  **Turn off and unplug** your LG washing machine. Safety first is my motto.
2.  **Locate the access panel** at the bottom front. It might be on the right or left side.
3.  **Open the panel**. Some models have a small door; others require prying with a flathead screwdriver.
4.  **Place a shallow pan and towels** under the filter cap. Water will drain out.
5.  **Unscrew the filter cap** counter-clockwise. You may need to turn it slowly to control the water flow.
6.  **Remove the filter** once all water drains.
7.  **Clean the filter** thoroughly under running water. Remove all lint, debris, and foreign objects. Check inside the pump housing opening for anything stuck.
8.  **Inspect the propeller** behind the filter. Make sure it spins freely.
9.  **Screw the filter back in** clockwise until it is tight.
10. **Close the access panel**.

Cleaning the drain pump filter is a simple task that can solve most drainage problems. I recommend cleaning it every few months, or more often if you wash items that shed a lot of lint.

## Inspecting the Drain Hose for Kinks or Obstructions

The drain hose carries water from your washing machine to the standpipe or laundry sink. If this hose is bent, twisted, or blocked, water cannot flow out. A kinked hose acts like a closed valve, preventing drainage. Obstructions inside the hose can also stop water flow. This is a common and easy problem to overlook. I always check the drain hose first when facing a drainage issue.

### Checking and Clearing the Drain Hose

Start by visually inspecting the entire length of the drain hose. Look behind the machine for any obvious kinks or twists. The hose should run smoothly without sharp bends. Make sure the hose is not crimped against the wall or other appliances. Sometimes, the hose can get pushed too far into the standpipe, creating an airlock or hitting an obstruction.

If you suspect an internal blockage:

1.  **Pull the washing machine away from the wall** to get full access to the back.
2.  **Unplug the machine** for safety.
3.  **Remove the drain hose** from the standpipe or laundry sink. Have a bucket ready, as water may come out.
4.  **Inspect both ends** of the hose for debris.
5.  **Try to flush water through the hose** with a garden hose or by pouring water through it from a faucet. See if water flows freely. If not, there's a blockage.
6.  **Use a drain snake or long wire** to clear any internal clogs. Push it gently through the hose.
7.  **Reattach the hose**, ensuring it is not kinked. Make sure it has a proper air gap at the standpipe or sink. The hose should not sit flush inside the drain pipe.

The drain hose also needs to be at the correct height. If the hose is too low, water can siphon out prematurely. If it is too high, the pump may struggle to push water up. Most LG washing machines require the drain hose to be between 30 and 96 inches from the floor. Checking the drain hose is a quick way to diagnose a non-draining problem. Removing the drain hose might seem tricky, but this article can guide you: [How to Remove LG Washing Machine Drain Hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-lg-washing-machine-drain-hose).

## Faulty Drain Pump: When the Motor Gives Up

The drain pump is the heart of your washing machine's drainage system. It is an electrical motor with an impeller that pushes water out. If the drain pump is faulty, it will not activate, or its impeller will not spin correctly. This means no water moves out of the tub. A faulty drain pump can make a humming noise without draining, or it might make no noise at all. This is a more serious issue than a clogged filter but still fixable.

### Diagnosing a Malfunctioning Drain Pump

Before replacing the pump, first rule out clogs. A clogged filter or hose can mimic a faulty pump. After checking those, listen to the machine during the drain cycle.

Signs of a faulty drain pump:

*   **No humming or whirring sound** during the drain cycle.
*   **Humming sound but no water movement**. This indicates the motor is running, but the impeller is jammed or broken.
*   **Error codes** on the display related to drainage (e.g., OE, OC, ND).

To inspect the drain pump, you often need to access it from the bottom or back of the machine. This usually involves tilting the washer or removing a rear panel.

1.  **Unplug the washing machine.** Always disconnect power first.
2.  **Drain any standing water** from the tub manually. You can use a wet vacuum or buckets.
3.  **Access the drain pump.** Refer to your LG washing machine's user manual for the exact location and access method. It is often near the drain filter.
4.  **Disconnect the electrical connector** from the pump.
5.  **Remove the hoses connected to the pump.** Be ready for residual water.
6.  **Unscrew or unclip the pump** from its mounting.
7.  **Inspect the impeller** (the fan-like part) inside the pump. It should spin freely. Look for cracks or damage. Foreign objects like coins or hairpins can jam the impeller. Remove any obstructions.
8.  **Test the pump's continuity** with a multimeter if you have one. This checks if the electrical circuit is complete. A reading of infinity (OL) means the pump motor is likely bad.

If the pump impeller is damaged or the pump shows no continuity, it needs replacement. Replacing a drain pump involves some mechanical skill, but it is a common DIY repair.

## Lid Switch or Door Latch Issues

Modern washing machines, both top-loaders and front-loaders, have safety features that prevent operation when the lid or door is open. The lid switch (for top-loaders) or door latch (for front-loaders) tells the machine whether the door is securely closed. If this switch or latch fails, the machine might not proceed to the drain and spin cycle. It thinks the door is open, even when it is not. This prevents the pump from activating.

### Checking the Lid Switch (Top-Loader)

For top-load LG washing machines, the lid switch is usually located under the main top, near the hinge area. When you close the lid, a small plastic or metal peg on the lid presses down on the switch, completing an electrical circuit.

How to check:

1.  **Open the lid** of your top-load LG washer.
2.  **Locate the lid switch**. It might be a small plastic protrusion.
3.  **Manually depress the switch** with your finger or a pen. Listen for a click.
4.  **Start a drain/spin cycle** with the lid manually held down. If the machine drains, the lid switch is likely faulty and needs replacement.
5.  **Inspect for visible damage**. Sometimes, the plastic activator on the lid itself breaks off.

### Checking the Door Latch (Front-Loader)

Front-load LG washing machines use a door latch assembly that locks the door during operation. This assembly contains a switch that signals to the machine that the door is closed and locked. If the latch is broken or the switch inside it fails, the machine will not drain or spin. It might also show a door error code.

How to check:

1.  **Examine the door and latch assembly** for any visible damage. Ensure the door closes and latches firmly.
2.  **Try to gently push on the door** during a cycle to see if it engages the latch better.
3.  **Listen for the locking sound** when you press start. If you hear no click or whir of the lock, the latch might be faulty.
4.  **Error codes** like "dL" (door lock) often point to this issue.
5.  **Accessing the door latch** requires removing the front panel or the door boot. This is a more involved repair. You might need to test the continuity of the latch switch with a multimeter. If it shows no continuity when closed, it is bad.

A faulty lid switch or door latch sends a false signal to the control board. The control board then stops the machine from draining to prevent water spills or injury. Replacing these parts often resolves the issue.

## Problems with the Main Control Board

The main control board acts as the "brain" of your LG washing machine. It sends electrical signals to all components, including the drain pump, based on your selected cycle. If the main control board malfunctions, it might fail to send the command to the drain pump, even if the pump itself is fine. This can cause the washer not to drain. Control board issues are less common than clogs or faulty pumps, but they do happen.

### Diagnosing a Control Board Issue

Diagnosing a faulty main control board can be tricky without specialized tools. However, there are some indicators:

*   **No power to the drain pump**: If you have tested the drain pump and confirmed it works, but it receives no power during the drain cycle, the control board might be at fault.
*   **Intermittent issues**: The machine drains sometimes but not always, or stops mid-cycle.
*   **Other functions failing**: If multiple components (like the display, water valves, or motor) act erratically, it could point to a control board problem.
*   **No error codes**: Sometimes, a failing control board might not generate specific error codes.

Replacing a main control board is usually an expensive repair. I recommend exhausting all other troubleshooting steps first. If you suspect the control board, it might be best to call a qualified appliance technician. They can perform more precise diagnostic tests. Sometimes, a power reset can temporarily fix minor board glitches. Unplug the machine for 5-10 minutes, then plug it back in. This simple reset can sometimes clear a temporary electronic fault.

## Issues with the House Drain or Standpipe

Sometimes, the problem isn't with your LG washing machine at all. The issue might be with your home's plumbing. If the standpipe or laundry sink drain that your washing machine empties into is clogged, water will back up. This prevents the machine from draining properly, causing water to remain in the tub or even overflow. This is an external factor, but it directly impacts your washing machine's ability to drain.

### Checking Your Home's Plumbing

1.  **Observe the drain pipe**: During the drain cycle, watch the standpipe or sink where the hose empties. Does water back up or flow out very slowly?
2.  **Run other water sources**: Turn on the laundry sink faucet (if applicable) or a nearby utility sink. Does that drain slowly? If so, the clog is in your house plumbing, not the washer.
3.  **Clear the standpipe**:
    *   **Remove the washing machine drain hose** from the standpipe.
    *   **Pour a bucket of water** down the standpipe. Does it drain quickly?
    *   **Use a drain snake** if the water drains slowly or not at all. Gently push the snake down the standpipe to clear any blockages. Hair, lint, and soap scum can build up over time.
    *   **Consider a chemical drain cleaner** as a last resort, following product instructions carefully. I prefer mechanical methods first.

If your home's drain system is indeed clogged, you will need to clear that blockage. Once the house drain is clear, your LG washing machine should drain without problems. This issue is easy to miss if you only focus on the washing machine itself.

## Preventative Measures to Avoid Drainage Problems

Preventing issues is always better than fixing them. Regular maintenance can significantly reduce the chances of your LG washing machine not draining. Simple habits can extend the life of your appliance and ensure smooth operation. I encourage everyone to adopt these practices for their LG washer.

### Regular Cleaning and Inspection

*   **Clean the Drain Pump Filter:** Make it a habit to clean the drain pump filter every 2-3 months. This is the most effective way to prevent clogs from lint, coins, and small items. If you wash pet bedding or heavily soiled items often, clean it monthly.
*   **Inspect the Drain Hose:** Periodically check the drain hose for kinks, twists, or signs of wear. Ensure it is properly secured and positioned at the correct height. A quick visual check can prevent future headaches.
*   **Run a Washer Cleaning Cycle:** Use your LG washer's "Tub Clean" or "Sanitize" cycle monthly. This helps remove soap residue, mildew, and lint buildup inside the tub and hoses. For best results, use a washing machine cleaner or white vinegar during this cycle. This also helps keep internal components clean. More tips on cleaning can be found here: [How to Clean an LG Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-an-lg-washing-machine).
*   **Use the Right Detergent:** Use only high-efficiency (HE) detergent for HE washers. Using too much regular detergent creates excessive suds, which can make draining difficult and leave residue. Measure detergent carefully.

### Best Practices for Loading and Usage

*   **Check Pockets:** Always check pockets before washing clothes. Coins, keys, tissues, and small toys are common culprits for clogging drain filters and pumps.
*   **Wash Delicates in Bags:** Use mesh laundry bags for delicate items like bras, socks, or small children's clothing. This prevents small items from escaping and entering the drain system.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Do not overload your LG washing machine. Overloading can stress the motor, including the drain pump, and prevent proper agitation and drainage. It can also cause clothes to shed more lint.
*   **Proper Installation:** Ensure the washing machine is installed correctly, with the drain hose at the right height and free from obstructions. If you recently moved the machine, double-check the hose position.

By following these preventative measures, you can keep your LG washing machine draining efficiently for many years. A little maintenance goes a long way in avoiding frustrating appliance breakdowns.

## When to Call a Professional Appliance Technician

While many LG washing machine drainage issues are fixable with DIY methods, some problems require professional help. Knowing when to call a technician can save you time, prevent further damage, and ensure the repair is done correctly. I believe it's wise to recognize your limits when dealing with complex appliance repairs.

### Situations Requiring Professional Assistance

*   **Persistent Error Codes:** If your LG washing machine consistently displays specific error codes related to drainage (like OE, OC, ND) even after you've tried common fixes like cleaning the filter and checking the hose, a technician can diagnose underlying electrical or component failures.
*   **Control Board Malfunction:** As discussed, diagnosing and replacing a main control board is complex. If you suspect the board is faulty and have ruled out all other possibilities, it is time for a professional. They have diagnostic tools to confirm board issues.
*   **Motor or Transmission Problems:** If the machine fails to spin or drains only partially, and you've ruled out the pump, it might be an issue with the main drive motor or transmission. These are major components that require specialized repair.
*   **Water Leakage During Drain Cycle:** If you notice water leaking from the machine during the drain cycle, it could indicate a cracked pump housing, a loose hose connection inside the machine, or a damaged seal. A professional can identify the exact source of the leak and repair it safely.
*   **Lack of Confidence or Tools:** If you are uncomfortable performing any of the diagnostic or repair steps, or if you lack the necessary tools (like a multimeter), calling a professional is the safest option. Attempting a repair beyond your skill level can lead to more damage or injury.
*   **Under Warranty:** If your LG washing machine is still under warranty, contact LG customer service or an authorized service center. Attempting DIY repairs might void your warranty.

A qualified appliance technician has the experience, tools, and knowledge to accurately diagnose complex problems. They can replace faulty parts like the drain pump, control board, or motor safely and efficiently. Investing in a professional repair can often be more cost-effective than attempting multiple unsuccessful DIY fixes.
