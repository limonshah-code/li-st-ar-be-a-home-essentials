## Understanding Your Kenmore Refrigerator Compressor

The compressor is the heart of your refrigerator. It makes the cooling process possible. It circulates refrigerant through the system. This refrigerant absorbs heat from inside the fridge. Then it releases that heat outside. A working compressor makes a quiet humming sound.

When the compressor functions correctly, your food stays cold. If it stops working, your refrigerator will not cool. This can lead to spoiled food. Understanding its role helps you troubleshoot problems. You need to know when to check this important part.

Many Kenmore refrigerators are reliable appliances. Some models are actually made by major manufacturers. For example, you might find that [is Kenmore refrigerator made by Whirlpool](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-kenmore-refrigerator-made-by-whirlpool). Knowing this can sometimes help with finding specific parts or repair information. Each Kenmore model has its own unique features.

The compressor runs on an electrical motor. It also has a starting relay and an overload protector. These parts ensure the compressor starts safely. They also prevent it from overheating. Issues with these components can stop the compressor from running. A simple power cycle can sometimes fix minor electrical glitches.

### How the Compressor Works

*   **Compression:** The compressor takes low-pressure, cool refrigerant gas. It compresses this gas. This raises its temperature and pressure.
*   **Condensation:** The hot, high-pressure gas moves to the condenser coils. These are often at the back of the fridge. Here, the gas cools down and turns into a liquid. It releases heat into your kitchen.
*   **Expansion:** The liquid refrigerant flows through an expansion valve. This valve lowers its pressure. The liquid becomes very cold.
*   **Evaporation:** The cold liquid moves into the evaporator coils. These are inside the fridge and freezer compartments. It absorbs heat from the air inside. This makes the liquid turn back into a gas. The process then repeats.

## Why Would You Need to Reset Your Kenmore Refrigerator Compressor?

You might consider a compressor reset for several reasons. Often, a "reset" is done to clear minor electrical issues. Modern refrigerators have complex electronic controls. These controls manage the compressor's operation. Like a computer, these systems can sometimes glitch.

A power outage can also cause issues. When power returns, the fridge's electronics might not restart correctly. This can lead to the compressor not turning on. In such cases, a simple reset can often fix the problem. You might experience your Kenmore refrigerator not cooling properly. This can happen right after a power disruption. For specific guidance on this, learn [how to reset Kenmore refrigerator after power outage](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-kenmore-refrigerator-after-power-outage).

## Step-by-Step Guide to Resetting Your Kenmore Refrigerator Compressor

Resetting your Kenmore refrigerator compressor is usually a straightforward process. It involves a hard reset of the appliance. This means removing power completely. Follow these steps carefully to ensure safety and effectiveness.

**1. Prepare for the Reset:**
First, empty your refrigerator and freezer compartments. Move perishable items into a cooler with ice. This ensures your food stays safe while the fridge is off. If your fridge has an ice maker, turn off its water supply. This prevents any leaks when the fridge loses power.

**2. Locate the Power Source:**
Your Kenmore refrigerator plugs into a standard wall outlet. Find this outlet. It is usually behind the refrigerator. Make sure you can reach it safely.

**3. Unplug the Refrigerator:**
Carefully pull the refrigerator away from the wall. This lets you access the power cord. Then, grasp the plug firmly. Pull it straight out from the wall outlet. Avoid pulling on the cord itself. This can damage the cord or the outlet.

**4. Wait for a Full Reset:**
Leave the refrigerator unplugged for at least 5 to 10 minutes. This waiting period is important. It allows any residual electrical charge in the control board to dissipate. This truly resets the electronic components. Some technicians recommend even longer, up to 15 minutes, for a thorough reset.

**5. Plug the Refrigerator Back In:**
After the waiting period, plug the refrigerator back into the wall outlet. Ensure the plug is fully seated. You should hear the compressor start running shortly. It might take a few minutes for the compressor to kick in and the cooling to begin.

**6. Monitor Performance:**
Over the next few hours, monitor your refrigerator's performance. Check the internal temperature after a few hours. Use a thermometer to verify it reaches the set temperature. The freezer should get to 0°F (-18°C) and the fresh food section to 37°F (3°C). If the fridge starts cooling normally, your reset was successful. If not, further troubleshooting or professional help may be needed.

## Troubleshooting Common Kenmore Refrigerator Compressor Issues (Before Resetting)

Before attempting a compressor reset, it's wise to check for simpler issues. Many problems that appear to be compressor-related are not. Addressing these first can save you time and effort. A compressor reset is a good step, but it won't fix everything.

**1. Check Power Supply:**
Ensure your Kenmore refrigerator is plugged in firmly. Check the outlet it uses. You can plug another appliance into the same outlet to test it. If the outlet works, the problem is with the fridge. Also, check your home's circuit breaker box. A tripped breaker can cut power to the refrigerator. Reset any tripped breakers.

**2. Verify Temperature Settings:**
Accidentally changing temperature settings is common. Make sure your fridge and freezer are set to appropriate temperatures. The fresh food section should be around 37°F (3°C). The freezer should be 0°F (-18°C). Adjust settings if needed.

**3. Inspect Condenser Coils:**
Dirty condenser coils can cause cooling problems. These coils are usually at the back or bottom of the fridge. Dust and pet hair can block airflow. This makes the compressor work harder. Overheating can cause it to shut down. Unplug the fridge and clean the coils with a vacuum cleaner. Use a brush attachment to remove debris.

**4. Check Door Seals:**
Leaky door seals let warm air into the refrigerator. This makes the compressor run constantly. It struggles to maintain temperature. Test the seals by closing the door on a dollar bill. If the bill pulls out easily, the seal is weak. Replace faulty door gaskets if needed.

**5. Listen for Unusual Noises:**
A healthy compressor makes a low hum. Listen for clicking, grinding, or buzzing sounds. These could point to issues with the start relay or motor. A clicking sound often means the overload protector is tripping. It tries to start the compressor but fails.

**6. Ensure Proper Ventilation:**
Refrigerators need space around them for airflow. This helps dissipate heat from the condenser coils. Make sure your Kenmore fridge is not pushed too close to a wall. Leave a few inches of space on the sides and back.

If these basic troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issue, then a hard reset might be the next logical step. If the problem persists after a reset, it points to a more serious issue. At that point, consider professional help. Many repair guides for different brands, such as [how to reset Frigidaire refrigerator compressor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-frigidaire-refrigerator-compressor), follow similar basic troubleshooting steps for general refrigerator issues.

## When a Reset Isn't Enough: Identifying Serious Compressor Problems

While a reset can fix minor glitches, it cannot repair mechanical failures. If your Kenmore refrigerator still doesn't cool after a reset, the problem is likely more serious. You need to identify signs of a failing compressor or other major components.

**1. Compressor Not Running At All:**
After a reset, if you hear no hum from the compressor, it might be dead. No sound indicates no power or a failed internal motor. This is a clear sign that a professional is needed.

**2. Constant Clicking Sounds:**
A repetitive clicking sound, often every few minutes, points to a faulty start relay or overload protector. These parts try to start the compressor but fail. While these parts can be replaced, it requires technical skill. If the clicking continues, the compressor cannot operate.

**3. Very Loud or Grinding Noises:**
If the compressor makes loud grinding, rattling, or squealing noises, its internal mechanics might be failing. This often means the compressor itself is worn out. This is a serious issue that requires replacement.

**4. Refrigerator Is Warm but Compressor Is Hot:**
Touch the compressor unit (usually a black dome at the back bottom). If it's extremely hot to the touch, and the fridge is not cooling, it's overheating. This could be due to a faulty overload protector, restricted airflow, or internal compressor failure. A hot compressor, especially without cooling, indicates a significant issue.

**5. Frost Buildup on Evaporator Coils (Inside Freezer):**
Excessive frost can block airflow. This causes the compressor to run constantly but inefficiently. This might indicate an issue with the defrost system. While not a compressor problem directly, it can overwork the compressor. If your fridge stops cooling due to heavy frost, a defrost system check is needed before focusing on the compressor.

**6. Refrigerant Leaks:**
If you notice a sweet, chemical smell around your refrigerator, it could be a refrigerant leak. A visible oily residue near the compressor or coils also indicates a leak. Leaks mean the compressor has nothing to compress. This makes it unable to cool. Refrigerant leaks are dangerous and require professional repair.

If you observe any of these serious signs, do not try to fix them yourself. These repairs involve dangerous refrigerants and high voltage. Replacing a compressor is a complex task. It requires specialized tools and knowledge. It is also often expensive. You might weigh the cost of repair versus buying a new refrigerator. For comparison, you can explore the costs associated with other brand compressors like [how much is LG refrigerator compressor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-is-lg-refrigerator-compressor).

## Maintaining Your Kenmore Refrigerator for Optimal Compressor Performance

Proper maintenance extends the life of your Kenmore refrigerator. It also helps the compressor run efficiently. Regular care can prevent many common cooling problems. This reduces the need for frequent troubleshooting or resets.

**1. Clean Condenser Coils Regularly:**
Dirty coils are a leading cause of compressor failure. Dust, dirt, and pet hair accumulate on them. This traps heat. The compressor has to work harder. It uses more energy and wears out faster. Aim to clean the condenser coils every 6-12 months. Unplug the fridge first. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment. Clean the coils at the back or underneath the unit.

**2. Check Door Gaskets for Leaks:**
Worn or dirty door seals let warm air into the fridge. This makes the compressor run more often. It never fully rests. Check the seals regularly. Clean them with mild soap and water. Test them by closing the door on a dollar bill. If the bill pulls out easily, the seal needs replacement. Ensure your doors close tightly.

**3. Maintain Proper Airflow:**
Do not overfill your refrigerator. Overpacking blocks airflow. This prevents cold air from circulating evenly. It forces the compressor to work harder. Leave some space between items. Also, ensure there is enough space around the exterior of the refrigerator. This allows heat from the condenser coils to escape. Keep it a few inches from walls and cabinets.

**4. Set Appropriate Temperatures:**
Set your fridge to 37°F (3°C) and your freezer to 0°F (-18°C). Setting temperatures too low makes the compressor work unnecessarily hard. Fluctuating temperatures can also stress the compressor. Maintain consistent settings.

**5. Defrost Manual Freezers as Needed:**
If you have a manual defrost Kenmore freezer, defrost it regularly. Frost buildup reduces cooling efficiency. It forces the compressor to work harder to overcome the ice barrier. Follow your owner's manual for proper defrosting procedures.

**6. Protect from Power Surges:**
Power surges can damage electronic components, including the compressor's control board. Consider using a surge protector for your refrigerator. This protects it from sudden voltage spikes. This is especially important in areas with frequent power fluctuations.

By following these maintenance tips, you can help your Kenmore refrigerator's compressor last longer. It will also run more efficiently. This saves energy and reduces the likelihood of breakdowns. Proactive care is key to appliance longevity.
