## What Does the AE Code Mean on Your LG Dishwasher?

Imagine this: You have just finished a delicious meal. You load your dirty dishes into the LG dishwasher, press start, and expect sparkling clean results. Instead, you walk by later to see a cryptic "AE" code flashing on the display. My first thought is usually, "What now?" This specific error code on an LG dishwasher can certainly cause a moment of panic. It tells you there is a problem inside your appliance.

The "AE" code is not just a random signal. It indicates a serious issue that needs immediate attention. This code points to an internal leak detected within the dishwasher. Your dishwasher has a built-in safety system. This system stops the machine from running when it senses water where it should not be. Understanding this code is the first step toward getting your kitchen back in order. I will explain exactly what the AE code signifies. I will also guide you through its common causes. You will learn straightforward steps to diagnose and resolve this issue. This guide aims to help you fix your LG dishwasher AE code and restore its proper function.

### Takeaway:

*   The AE code on an LG dishwasher indicates an internal water leak.
*   This error triggers a safety shutdown to prevent water damage.
*   Common causes include leaky hoses, faulty pumps, or a tripped leak sensor.
*   Initial troubleshooting involves checking for visible water and power cycling the unit.
*   Many AE code issues are fixable with simple DIY steps.

The AE code on an LG dishwasher means "Aqua Exhaust" or "Leakage." This signals that the dishwasher's internal leak detection system has found water collecting in the base tray. The machine automatically stops its cycle and displays this code to prevent potential water damage in your home.

### Unpacking the Core Meaning of LG Dishwasher AE Code

The AE code on an LG dishwasher is a critical safety alert. It tells you that the appliance has detected water where it does not belong. This usually means water has escaped the main wash tub. It has pooled in the dishwasher's base pan. LG dishwashers are equipped with a float switch or a leak sensor located in this base pan. When water activates this sensor, the AE code appears. The dishwasher stops operation. This safety feature prevents water from leaking onto your floor. It protects your home from potential damage. It also protects the electrical components of the dishwasher.

When the AE code flashes, your dishwasher is in a protective mode. It will not run any wash cycles. It might even try to pump out water continuously. This is its way of responding to the detected leak. You need to address the source of the leak promptly. Ignoring this code can lead to bigger problems. It could cause significant water damage. It could also lead to mold growth under your appliance. I always advise immediate action when you see this code. It is the dishwasher telling you something is wrong internally. Getting to know [why does my LG dishwasher say AE](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-say-ae) provides more insights into the mechanism behind this error.

The design of the LG dishwasher includes this AE code for your safety. It is a smart system. It detects even small amounts of water. The system prevents a large flood. Your goal now is to find out exactly where the water is coming from. Then you need to stop it. This process requires careful inspection of several components. Do not panic when you see this code. It is a sign that the safety system works. It warns you of an issue before it escalates.

### Common Culprits Behind the AE Error

Several components within your LG dishwasher can cause the AE error code to appear. Understanding these common culprits helps you narrow down your investigation. Each part plays a specific role in water containment or movement. A failure in any of these areas can lead to a leak.

#### Leaky Inlet or Outlet Hoses

The hoses connected to your dishwasher are a frequent source of leaks. The water inlet hose brings fresh water into the dishwasher. The drain hose removes dirty water. Over time, these hoses can wear out. They can crack, kink, or loosen at their connections. Check both ends of these hoses. Look for visible drips or wet spots. Pay attention to the connections at the water supply valve and the garbage disposal or sink drain. A loose clamp can cause a slow leak. I often find this to be a straightforward fix.

#### Damaged Dishwasher Tub or Gasket

The dishwasher tub itself can develop cracks, though this is less common. More frequently, the door gasket or seal can be the problem. The door gasket forms a watertight seal when the dishwasher door closes. If this rubber seal becomes old, torn, or brittle, water can leak from around the door. Inspect the entire perimeter of the door gasket. Look for any visible damage or signs of wear. Sometimes, food debris can also get stuck under the gasket. This can prevent a proper seal. Cleaning the gasket can sometimes resolve this issue.

#### Malfunctioning Water Valve or Pump

The water inlet valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. If this valve sticks open or leaks internally, it can cause overfilling. An overfilled tub leads to water spilling into the base. The circulation pump moves water through the spray arms during the wash cycle. The drain pump removes water from the tub. A crack in a pump housing or a loose connection can cause a leak. You might also find issues with the pump seals. These internal components often require more technical assessment. They are a common reason for water collecting in the base.

#### Overfilled Tub or Excess Suds

Sometimes, the AE code appears not because of a direct leak from a component, but due to an operational issue. Using too much detergent, especially non-dishwasher detergent, creates excessive suds. These suds can overflow the tub. They then spill into the base pan. Also, a faulty water level sensor can cause the dishwasher to overfill. This again leads to water escaping into the base. Always use the correct type and amount of detergent. This prevents suds-related overflows.

### Essential Troubleshooting Steps for AE Code

When your LG dishwasher flashes the AE code, it is telling you there is water where it shouldn't be. Do not worry. There are several essential troubleshooting steps you can take before calling a professional. These steps help you identify the leak source and often resolve the issue yourself. Getting to know [how to fix LG dishwasher with AE code](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-dishwasher-with-ae-code) offers more detailed repair steps.

First, **disconnect the power supply**. Safety is paramount. Unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet. If it is hardwired, flip the circuit breaker off at your home's electrical panel. This prevents electric shock during your inspection. You never want to work on an appliance with live power.

Next, **check for visible water**. Look around the base of the dishwasher. Look under it if possible. Is there a puddle on the floor? Is the kick plate wet? Sometimes, the leak is obvious. Use towels to soak up any standing water. You need to find any wet spots. Also, pull the dishwasher slightly out from its cabinet if you can. This lets you inspect the back. You can also check the hoses connected to the water supply and drain. Make sure they are tight. Ensure they have no cracks or kinks.

Then, **tilt the dishwasher** carefully. This step helps drain any water from the base pan. Get a helper if possible. Gently tilt the dishwasher forward about 45 degrees. You may see water drain out from underneath. Place towels or a shallow pan to catch this water. Hold it in this position for about 60 seconds. This action should empty the leak pan. Once the water stops draining, lower the dishwasher back down slowly.

Finally, **reset the dishwasher**. After draining the water, plug the dishwasher back in or turn the circuit breaker on. The AE code should clear if the leak pan is dry. Run a short cycle. Watch closely for the AE code to reappear. If it does, the leak persists. This indicates a more persistent issue. A general reset for LG appliances can sometimes clear minor glitches. For example, knowing [how to reset LG refrigerator error code](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-lg-refrigerator-error-code) can give you an idea of common reset procedures across LG products. Always ensure the appliance is disconnected from power before attempting any physical checks.

### Inspecting Key Components When AE Appears

Once you have performed the initial troubleshooting steps and dried out the base, if the AE code reappears, you need to dig deeper. This means inspecting specific internal components of your LG dishwasher. Each of these parts plays a vital role in preventing leaks.

#### The Leak Sensor's Role

The leak sensor is the component that triggers the AE code. It is a small float switch or sensor located in the dishwasher's base pan. If water collects there, the sensor lifts or gets wet. This sends a signal to the control board. The control board then displays the AE error. Sometimes, the sensor itself can be faulty. It might falsely detect water even when the base is dry. In this case, you might need to test the sensor. A dry sensor should not trigger the code. If it does, the sensor may need replacement. You should also ensure no debris is blocking the sensor.

#### Checking the Water Inlet Valve

The water inlet valve is crucial for controlling water flow into the dishwasher. It connects to your home's water supply line. You will usually find it at the bottom rear of the dishwasher. Inspect this valve for any signs of external leaks. Look for water drips or corrosion around its connections. The valve can also fail internally. This allows water to continuously seep into the tub, even when the dishwasher is off. If you suspect the valve, you might hear a faint hissing sound when the dishwasher is off. This indicates water passing through it. A faulty inlet valve may lead to the tub overfilling. This then spills water into the base.

#### Examining the Drain Pump

The drain pump removes water from the dishwasher tub after a wash cycle. If the drain pump or its hoses leak, water will collect in the base pan. Look for water stains or drips around the pump housing. Check all hose connections to and from the drain pump. These connections should be tight. The hoses themselves should not have any cracks. A worn-out seal around the pump's impeller shaft can also cause a slow, persistent leak. When this part fails, it contributes to water accumulation that the AE code detects.

#### Understanding the Circulation Pump

The circulation pump is responsible for moving water through the spray arms during the wash cycle. It is a critical component for proper cleaning. If the circulation pump develops a leak, water will escape into the base. This leak often occurs around the pump's motor shaft seal. Over time, these seals can degrade. Look for water pooling directly underneath the pump assembly. This is usually located at the bottom center of the dishwasher tub. A crack in the pump housing itself is less common but can happen. Any leak from the circulation pump will activate the AE sensor. This is because water gathers in the drip pan beneath the dishwasher.

### Addressing External Factors and Installation

The AE code does not always point to a broken internal component. Sometimes, external factors or improper installation contribute to the leak. These are important to consider during your troubleshooting process. Checking these points can save you from unnecessary part replacements.

First, consider **leveling issues**. An LG dishwasher needs to be perfectly level to function correctly. If the dishwasher tilts forward or to one side, water can slosh out of the tub. It can then spill into the base pan. Use a spirit level to check the top and sides of your dishwasher. Adjust the leveling legs at the bottom if needed. Most dishwashers have adjustable front legs. Some have rear ones too. Properly leveling the unit ensures water stays contained within the wash tub.

Second, **improper drain hose connection** can cause problems. The drain hose carries dirty water away from the dishwasher. If this hose is not installed with a high loop or an air gap, water can back up into the dishwasher. This backflow can cause the tub to overfill. It allows water to spill into the base. Make sure the drain hose creates a high loop. This means the hose goes up high under your sink before descending to the drain connection. An air gap device is also an option. It prevents drain water from entering the dishwasher. A proper drain setup prevents dirty water from re-entering. It also prevents overflows. For more information on related water issues, learning [why does my LG dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) can be useful.

Third, **excessive detergent use** is a very common culprit for the AE code. Using too much dish detergent, or the wrong type of detergent, creates excessive suds. These suds can fill the entire tub. They then overflow into the base pan. The leak sensor detects this overflow as a leak. Always use only detergent designed for dishwashers. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for the correct amount. Less is often more with concentrated detergents. Switching to a different brand of detergent can also help if you suspect sudsing is the issue.

Finally, consider **high water pressure**. In some homes, the incoming water pressure can be too high for the dishwasher. High pressure can force water past seals and connections. This creates leaks. If you suspect high water pressure, a plumber can measure it. They can install a pressure reducing valve if necessary. This protects your appliance. It also protects your home's plumbing. While less common, it is a possibility for persistent, unexplained leaks.

### When to Call a Professional for LG Dishwasher AE Code

While many AE code issues can be resolved with DIY troubleshooting, there are times when calling a professional is the smartest and safest option. Knowing when to escalate the problem saves you time, frustration, and potential further damage.

You should consider professional help if **you cannot locate the leak source**. You might have checked all the common areas. You might have drained the base. If the AE code still reappears, and you cannot see where the water is coming from, the leak might be internal and hard to access. It could be a crack in the tub that is only visible when filled with water. It might also be a faulty component that requires specialized diagnostic tools.

Another reason to call an expert is **if you lack the right tools or skills**. Some repairs require specific tools. These include multimeter for electrical testing or specialized wrenches. Disassembling the dishwasher can also be complex. It may require specific knowledge of its internal layout. If you feel uncomfortable taking apart your appliance, or if you do not have the necessary tools, a professional technician is your best bet. Attempting a repair beyond your skill level can cause more damage. It can also lead to injury.

**Repeated AE codes** after attempted fixes indicate a persistent problem. If you have tried the common solutions and the code keeps coming back, it means the underlying issue has not been fully resolved. This is a clear sign that a professional needs to diagnose the problem. They have the experience to spot subtle issues. They can also access proprietary diagnostic codes.

Finally, **safety is paramount**. Working with water and electricity carries inherent risks. If you are ever unsure about disconnecting power, handling wires, or dealing with potentially sharp components, stop immediately. Call a certified appliance repair technician. They have the training and safety equipment to perform the repair safely. They can also ensure the dishwasher functions correctly after the repair. A professional can quickly identify the problem. They can repair it efficiently. This gives you peace of mind.

### Preventing Future AE Error Codes

After successfully resolving an AE error code, your goal should be to prevent it from happening again. Proactive maintenance and proper usage are key to extending the life of your LG dishwasher and avoiding future leaks.

First, **regular cleaning is crucial**. Food particles, grease, and mineral deposits can build up inside your dishwasher. This buildup can clog filters, spray arms, and even the drain pump. Clogged components can lead to inefficient draining or water backing up, which can then overflow into the base pan. I recommend cleaning your dishwasher monthly. You can use a dishwasher cleaner tablet. You can also run an empty cycle with white vinegar or baking soda. This keeps the interior clear. It prevents blockages.

Second, **use the correct amount and type of detergent**. As I mentioned earlier, excessive suds are a common cause of the AE code. Always use high-efficiency dishwasher detergent. Do not use regular dish soap. Follow the detergent manufacturer's instructions for the dosage. Hard water conditions might require slightly more detergent. Soft water conditions often need less. Adjust accordingly. Using too much detergent creates excessive foam. This foam can spill over the tub. This then activates the leak sensor.

Third, **inspect hoses and seals periodically**. Take a moment every few months to visually check the water inlet hose, drain hose, and door gasket. Look for cracks, kinks, or signs of wear. Ensure all hose connections are secure. If you spot any damage, replace the part immediately. The door gasket should be clean and flexible. A simple wipe-down can prevent food debris from accumulating. This ensures a tight seal during cycles. Early detection of wear can prevent a major leak.

Fourth, **load your dishwasher properly**. Avoid overfilling the dishwasher. Do not block the spray arms. Improper loading can prevent water from draining correctly. It can also cause water to spray onto the door seal in an unusual way. This can potentially lead to leaks. Make sure dishes do not obstruct the detergent dispenser. Also, keep large items from blocking the lower spray arm. Proper loading ensures efficient washing and drainage.

Finally, **address minor issues promptly**. If you notice small drips, strange noises, or any other unusual behavior from your dishwasher, investigate it. Do not wait for a major error code like AE to appear. Addressing small problems early can prevent them from escalating into bigger, more costly repairs. A little preventative care goes a long way in keeping your LG dishwasher running smoothly and leak-free.
