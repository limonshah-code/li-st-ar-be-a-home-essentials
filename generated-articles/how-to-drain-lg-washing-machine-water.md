## Why Your LG Washer Has Standing Water

It is a common problem to find your LG washing machine filled with water. Many factors can cause this issue. Understanding these reasons helps you fix the problem efficiently. I have seen many cases where a simple check solves the problem quickly.

The most frequent culprit is a clogged drain pump filter. This filter catches lint, small items, and debris from your clothes. Over time, it can get blocked, preventing water from flowing out. Another common issue is a kinked or blocked drain hose. The hose carries water away from the machine, so any obstruction stops drainage.

Sometimes, the drain pump itself fails. The pump is an electrical component that pushes water out of the washer. If it breaks, water has no way to exit. Lastly, issues with the washer's control board or water level sensor can also cause drainage problems. These parts tell the machine when to drain. A fault here means the drain cycle never activates properly. Knowing these possible causes is the first step in fixing your LG washer.

### Common Obstructions in Your LG Washer

Many things can block your LG washing machine's drainage system. Lint is a major problem, especially from towels or fuzzy clothing. It builds up quickly in the drain pump filter. Small items like coins, buttons, or even socks can also get past the drum and into the drain pump.

These small objects can block the filter or even damage the pump impeller. Hair is another common obstruction. Long strands can wrap around parts inside the drain system. Detergent buildup can also contribute to clogs. Using too much detergent creates excessive suds and leaves residue. This residue combines with lint to form sticky blockages. Regularly checking for and removing these items is key to maintaining proper drainage.

## Essential Safety Precautions Before Draining

Safety must be your top priority when dealing with a water-filled washing machine. Ignoring safety steps can lead to electric shocks or water damage. I always stress these points before starting any repair or maintenance. Following these guidelines keeps you safe and protects your home.

Always disconnect the power supply to the washer. This means unplugging the machine from the wall outlet. If it is hardwired, you need to switch off the circuit breaker for your laundry area. This simple step prevents electrical hazards. Water and electricity are a dangerous mix. Ensure the machine is completely off before touching any part of it.

Prepare for spills. Even if you plan carefully, some water might escape. Have old towels and a mop ready. Place a large, shallow pan or a bucket directly under the drain pump filter area. This helps contain the water that will come out. Protecting your floor from water damage is important. Taking these precautions makes the draining process much safer and less messy.

## Step-by-Step Manual Drain Process for LG Washers

When your LG washing machine won't drain, a manual process is often needed. This method helps remove standing water before you troubleshoot further. I have guided many people through this, and it is manageable for most homeowners. Always have your tools and a plan ready before you begin.

First, ensure the washer is unplugged from the power outlet. This is crucial for safety. Next, locate the drain pump filter. On most LG front-load washing machines, this filter is behind a small access panel at the bottom front. For top-load models, the drain procedure might involve tilting the machine or accessing the rear. If your washer's drain hose is accessible, you can also use it to drain water.

Once you find the filter panel, open it carefully. You will see a small hose with a cap and a larger circular filter knob. Place a shallow pan or large towels beneath this area. This setup catches the water that will pour out. Slowly pull out the small drain hose and remove its cap. Water will start to flow out. If the flow stops, gently lower the hose further to encourage more drainage. Once most of the water drains from the small hose, slowly twist the large filter knob counter-clockwise to remove the drain pump filter itself. Be ready for more water, as the remaining water in the pump housing will come out.

### Draining Via the Drain Pump Filter

This is the primary method for draining stubborn water from an LG washer. The drain pump filter protects the pump from debris. It needs regular cleaning to work well. I recommend cleaning it every few months, even if you do not have drainage issues.

After you have unplugged the machine and placed your collection pan, open the small access door at the bottom front. You will see the small drain hose and the larger round drain pump filter. Some models only have the large filter. Pull out the small hose, uncap it, and let water flow into your pan. This drains most of the water from the drum. You can use a stopper or clip on the hose to control the flow.

Once the main water level drops, slowly unscrew the main drain pump filter counter-clockwise. Be careful, as more water will come out. Inspect the filter for lint, coins, hair, or other debris. Clean it thoroughly under running water. Also, look inside the filter housing with a flashlight. Remove any objects you find. When clean, screw the filter back in clockwise until tight. Replace the cap on the small hose and tuck it back into its spot. Close the access panel. This process helps resolve many non-draining issues.

### Draining Via the Drain Hose (Alternative)

If the drain pump filter is inaccessible or you need to move the machine, draining via the drain hose can be an option. This method is usually quicker for initial water removal. However, it will not address a clogged pump filter. It is an emergency way to empty the drum.

First, unplug the washer and pull it away from the wall. Locate the drain hose at the back of the machine. It is typically a corrugated plastic hose connected to a standpipe or laundry sink. Place a large bucket or a series of pans lower than the washer's drum. This is important because water drains by gravity. The lower the bucket, the better the flow.

Carefully detach the drain hose from its connection point. Be ready for water to rush out immediately. Direct the hose into your bucket. You might need to hold the hose low to ensure all water drains. Once the water stops flowing, reattach the hose securely to its standpipe or sink. Ensure there are no kinks in the hose before pushing the washer back into place. Proper installation prevents future problems.

## Troubleshooting Common LG Washer Drain Issues

Draining the water is often just the first step. You need to fix the root cause of why your LG washing machine won't drain. Many common issues can prevent proper drainage. I have helped many individuals get their LG washers back in working order. Understanding these problems helps you fix them quickly. For general guidance on getting your LG washer to drain, check out [how to get LG washing machine to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-lg-washing-machine-to-drain).

One of the most frequent problems is a clogged drain pump filter. This filter collects lint and debris, and it needs regular cleaning. Another common issue is a kinked or blocked drain hose. The hose must be free of obstructions and properly installed. Sometimes, the problem is not a clog but a faulty drain pump. The pump motor might have failed. A simple test can often confirm this.

Additionally, the pressure sensor or control board might be faulty. These components tell the washer when to drain. If they malfunction, the drain cycle might not activate. Over-sudsing from too much detergent can also fool the sensor, causing drainage issues. Understanding these potential causes helps you effectively troubleshoot your LG washing machine.

### Diagnosing a Clogged Drain Pump Filter

A clogged drain pump filter is the most common reason an LG washer fails to drain. This filter prevents debris from reaching the drain pump. When it gets full, water cannot pass through. I always suggest checking this first when troubleshooting drainage problems. It is a simple fix that saves a lot of time and hassle.

To diagnose, first perform the manual drain steps outlined earlier. Once the water is out, fully remove the drain pump filter. Inspect it closely. Look for lint, coins, hairpins, buttons, or any other small objects. These items easily block the mesh of the filter. If you find debris, clean the filter thoroughly under running water. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away stubborn lint.

Also, shine a flashlight into the opening where the filter screws in. Sometimes, objects can bypass the filter and get stuck deeper inside the pump housing or around the impeller. Remove any foreign objects you see. If the filter is clean and there are no obstructions in the housing, then the problem likely lies elsewhere. A clean filter is vital for proper water expulsion.

### Checking the Drain Hose for Kinks or Blockages

The drain hose is essential for carrying water away from your LG washing machine. If this hose is kinked or blocked, water cannot escape. This is a very simple check, but it is often overlooked. I always advise inspecting the hose after checking the pump filter.

First, pull your washing machine away from the wall. Examine the entire length of the drain hose. Look for any sharp bends or kinks. Sometimes, the hose gets squeezed against the wall or other appliances. Straighten out any kinks you find. Ensure the hose is not pushed too far down into the standpipe. If it goes too deep, it can create a siphoning effect that leads to partial drainage or backflow.

Next, check for internal blockages. Disconnect the drain hose from both the washer and the standpipe/laundry tub. Shine a flashlight through one end and look for obstructions. You can also try flushing water through it with a garden hose. If water does not flow freely, there is a blockage inside. Use a plumber's snake or a long brush to clear it. Once clear, reattach the hose securely. Ensure it is elevated properly at the back of the washer. The drain hose should form an air gap.

### Testing the Drain Pump and Pressure Sensor

If the filter and hose are clear, the drain pump or pressure sensor might be faulty. These components are critical for draining. I have seen many instances where a simple test reveals a broken part. Replacing these parts can revive your washer.

To test the drain pump, first ensure the washer is unplugged. Access the drain pump, which is usually located near the bottom of the machine. Disconnect the electrical connectors and hose clamps. With the pump removed, you can visually inspect its impeller for damage or obstructions. Sometimes, even after cleaning the filter, a small item might get lodged in the impeller. You can also test the pump's continuity with a multimeter if you are comfortable with electrical testing. A lack of continuity indicates a faulty motor. If the impeller is damaged or the motor fails, the pump needs replacement.

The pressure sensor detects the water level in the drum. It tells the control board when to activate the drain cycle. If this sensor malfunctions, the washer might not know to drain. Testing a pressure sensor usually requires a multimeter to check for proper resistance changes or voltage signals. However, visual inspection can sometimes reveal disconnected or damaged hoses leading to the sensor. If you suspect the sensor, consulting the service manual or calling a technician might be best. Sometimes, resetting the washer by unplugging it for 5-10 minutes can reset the sensor.

## Preventing Future LG Washing Machine Drainage Problems

Prevention is always better than cure when it comes to appliance maintenance. Taking a few simple steps can save you from future drainage headaches with your LG washing machine. I believe in proactive care to extend the life of your appliances. These tips are easy to implement and make a big difference.

Regularly clean your drain pump filter. This is the single most important preventive measure. Make it a habit to clean it every few months, or more often if you wash a lot of linty items. This simple task removes trapped debris before it causes a major clog. Also, check the drain hose periodically. Ensure it is not kinked or crushed behind the washer. Proper hose placement is key to consistent drainage.

Using the correct amount of detergent is also important. Too much detergent creates excessive suds, which can hinder drainage and leave residue. Opt for HE (High-Efficiency) detergent if your LG washer is an HE model. Regularly running a cleaning cycle with a washing machine cleaner or vinegar helps remove detergent buildup and mold. These actions keep your LG washer draining smoothly for years to come. For specific cleaning guidance, refer to [how to clean an LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-an-lg-washing-machine) or [how to clean LG HE washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-he-washing-machine).

### Regular Drain Pump Filter Maintenance

Regular maintenance of the drain pump filter is crucial. It prevents clogs and ensures efficient drainage. Many people forget about this small but important part. I tell all my friends to add this to their appliance maintenance checklist.

Aim to clean the filter at least every three to six months. If you have pets that shed a lot or wash heavily soiled items frequently, you should clean it more often. The process is quick and simple. First, unplug the washer for safety. Locate the access panel at the bottom front of your LG washing machine. Open it.

Have a shallow pan and towels ready. Pull out the small drain hose, uncap it, and let the water drain. Then, slowly unscrew the main drain pump filter. Remove any lint, coins, buttons, or other debris you find. Rinse the filter under warm water until it is clean. Also, check inside the pump housing for any remaining foreign objects. Once clean, reinsert the filter and screw it in tightly. Cap the small hose and close the access panel. This small act can prevent major drainage problems.

### Using the Correct Detergent and Load Size

The type and amount of detergent you use can significantly impact your washer's drainage. Incorrect usage is a common cause of issues. I have seen excessive suds cause more problems than actual mechanical failures. Choosing the right detergent and load size is simple and effective.

Always use High-Efficiency (HE) detergent for LG HE washing machines. These detergents produce fewer suds, which is vital for efficient drainage and rinsing. Standard detergents create too many suds, confusing the washer's sensors and preventing proper draining. Use only the recommended amount of detergent. More detergent does not mean cleaner clothes; it often means more residue and suds. Check your detergent's instructions and your washer's manual for proper dosage.

Overloading your washing machine can also hinder drainage. Large loads can prevent water from circulating and draining properly. Clothes can absorb too much water, making the load too heavy for the pump to handle efficiently. Leave enough space in the drum for clothes to tumble freely. A good rule of thumb is to not fill the drum more than three-quarters full. Proper load size ensures efficient washing and drainage cycles.

## When to Call a Professional for LG Washer Drain Issues

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your LG washing machine still won't drain. This is when it might be time to call a professional technician. While many issues are DIY-friendly, some problems require expert knowledge and specialized tools. I always advise knowing your limits to avoid further damage.

If you have tried all the manual draining steps, cleaned the filter, checked the hose, and even attempted to reset the machine, but the problem persists, it is a sign. If you hear unusual noises from the drain pump, like grinding or buzzing, it could indicate a motor failure. If the washer's control panel shows error codes related to drainage, and you cannot clear them, a deeper issue might be present.

Electrical problems or issues with the main control board are complex and dangerous to tackle without training. A professional technician has the diagnostic tools to pinpoint precise electrical or electronic faults. They can safely replace parts like the drain pump motor or control board. Investing in professional repair ensures the job is done right and safely. It also helps maintain your LG washer's warranty.
