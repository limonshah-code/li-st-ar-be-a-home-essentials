## How To Identify Bosch Dishwasher Model

It is common to need information about home appliances. You might need to fix something. You may want to order a new part. Knowing how to identify your Bosch dishwasher model is very important. This helps you get the right support. It ensures you buy the correct items for your specific machine.

This article shows you the best ways to find your Bosch dishwasher model number. We will look at the most common spots where this important label sits. I will also explain what the numbers and letters mean. You will learn how to use this information for service and upkeep. By the end, you will find your model number quickly. You can then handle any needs for your Bosch dishwasher with ease.

### Takeaway

*   The primary place to find your Bosch dishwasher model number is on the inner door rim.
*   Look for a sticker or metallic plate called the rating plate.
*   Check the top, side, or bottom edges of the dishwasher door.
*   Other spots include the kickplate area or the back of the appliance.
*   The model number (E-Nr) helps with repairs, parts, and manuals.

To identify your Bosch dishwasher model, look inside the dishwasher door. A sticker or metal plate, often called the rating plate, displays the model number (E-Nr) and serial number. This label usually sits on the top or side edge of the inner door rim, visible when the door is open.

### Why Identifying Your Bosch Dishwasher Model Is Crucial

Finding your Bosch dishwasher model number is more than just a task. It is a necessary step for owning the appliance. This number is a unique code. It identifies your specific dishwasher. Without it, you cannot get the right help.

Imagine your dishwasher stops working correctly. You call a repair person. The first thing they ask for is the model number. This number tells them the exact components inside your machine. It helps them diagnose issues. They can then bring the correct tools and parts. This saves time and money.

Ordering replacement parts also needs this number. Dishwashers have many parts. A filter for one model might not fit another. My own experience showed me this. I once ordered a wrong part for a dryer because I guessed the model. It did not fit. I wasted both time and shipping costs. Knowing your model ensures you get the exact wash arm, detergent dispenser, or rack clip. This avoids errors and delays.

The model number also confirms your warranty status. Bosch keeps records tied to these numbers. If your dishwasher needs service under warranty, the company needs to verify the model. This links your purchase to their records. It makes the warranty process smooth. You can get service without problems.

Furthermore, user manuals are specific to model numbers. If you lose your manual, you can download a new one from Bosch's website. You need the model number to find the correct document. This manual gives you instructions for use. It offers troubleshooting tips. It also provides maintenance guides. This number connects you to all the right resources for your dishwasher. This specific identification helps with many things. It ensures proper care and efficient repairs for your appliance. To learn more about finding these numbers, you can read our guide on [how to find Bosch dishwasher model number](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-find-bosch-dishwasher-model-number).

### The Primary Location: Inside the Dishwasher Door

The most common place to find your Bosch dishwasher model number is inside the door. This location is simple to check. It requires no tools. Most Bosch dishwashers have this label here.

First, open your dishwasher door completely. Look along the edges of the inner door. The label is often on the top rim. Sometimes it is on the side rim. It can also be on the bottom edge. I usually start by looking at the very top edge. This is the part that faces up when the door is fully open.

The label itself is a small sticker or a metallic plate. It usually has several lines of text. The important numbers are clearly marked. You will often see "Model No.," "E-Nr," or "Type." The "E-Nr" is the most common term Bosch uses for its model number. This number combines letters and digits. For example, it might look like "SHX45P05UC/64." Below the model number, you will find the serial number. This is often labeled "FD-Nr" or "Serial No."

Make sure the area is clean. Sometimes food particles or dried detergent can cover the label. Use a damp cloth to wipe it clean. This helps you read the numbers clearly. Take a picture with your phone once you find it. This provides a clear record. You can then refer to it whenever you need. This saves you from bending down each time. It makes the number easy to access. This inner door location is the first and best place to search.

### Exploring Alternate Locations for the Model Tag

While the inner door rim is the primary spot, Bosch dishwasher model numbers can be elsewhere. Some models, especially older ones or specific built-in types, might have the label hidden. You may need to check other areas if the door rim yields no results. This happens if the original label peeled off. It can also be due to different installation methods.

One alternate location is the kickplate area. The kickplate is the panel at the very bottom front of the dishwasher. It hides the components underneath the main tub. To check here, you might need to open the dishwasher door. Then, look down at the floor level. Sometimes, you need to remove the kickplate. Most kickplates pull straight off or have a few screws. Once removed, check the inside surface of the kickplate. The label might be stuck there.

Another less common spot is the side of the dishwasher tub. This means the metal side panel that is usually against the cabinet. You would need to pull the dishwasher out from its space to see this. This is a more involved step. I do not recommend pulling your dishwasher out unless it is absolutely necessary. It involves disconnecting water lines and power. Only do this if you are comfortable with appliance work.

The back of the appliance is also a possible location. Like the side panels, this requires pulling the dishwasher out. The label would be on the back casing. Again, this is not easy. It should be a last resort. If you plan to pull the dishwasher out, take safety precautions. Turn off the water supply and unplug the unit. This protects you from injury.

Sometimes the label might be very faded or obscured. This is common on older units. Dust, grime, or even previous repairs can make it hard to read. If you cannot read it clearly, try shining a flashlight at an angle. This can make faded text more visible. Knowing these other spots helps you find your model number. It ensures you have all the options when the main spot fails.

### Decoding Your Bosch Model and Serial Numbers

Once you find the rating plate, you will see more than one number. It is important to know which one is the model number. You also need to understand the serial number. These numbers serve different purposes for your Bosch dishwasher.

The model number is often labeled as "E-Nr" or "Model No." on Bosch appliances. This sequence of letters and digits defines your specific dishwasher version. For example, a common Bosch dishwasher model number might be "SHEM63W55N/01." The letters and numbers here tell Bosch about the series (e.g., "SH" for dishwasher, "E" for entry-level, "M" for specific features), size, color, and internal components. This number is what service technicians need. It tells them which parts are correct for your machine. When you order parts or look up manuals, this is the number to use.

The serial number is usually labeled "FD-Nr" or "Serial No." This number is different. It is a production number. It identifies when and where your specific unit was made. This number typically does not change based on features. It is unique to your individual appliance. The serial number helps Bosch track products for recalls or warranty claims. It is like a birth certificate for your dishwasher. For example, an FD-Nr might be "9901 000123." The first two digits often indicate the year of manufacture. The next two digits show the month. So "9901" means January 1999.

Understanding both numbers is helpful. You primarily use the model number (E-Nr) for finding parts, manuals, and troubleshooting guides. The serial number (FD-Nr) is useful for warranty questions or if Bosch needs to identify a batch of products. Always write down both numbers. Keep them in a safe place. You can also take a photo of the rating plate. This makes sure you have all the necessary details handy. Knowing these specific numbers makes maintaining your Bosch dishwasher easier.

### Essential Information on the Rating Plate

The rating plate on your Bosch dishwasher gives you more than just the model and serial numbers. It contains other important technical details. These details can be very useful for repairs, service, and understanding your appliance's power needs. Knowing what these additional numbers mean helps you. It ensures you provide full information to a technician.

One key piece of information is the voltage and wattage. The rating plate will show the electrical requirements for your dishwasher. For example, it might list "240V" and "15 Amps." This tells you the power supply your dishwasher needs. This information is important for electricians. It confirms proper installation. It also helps prevent electrical overload issues. Incorrect voltage can damage your appliance.

You might also find a barcode on the rating plate. This barcode holds the model and serial information in a scannable format. Service technicians can scan this with a device. This quick method helps them pull up your appliance details. It avoids manual entry errors. It is a quick way to confirm your specific unit.

The plate often lists various certifications as well. These certifications show that the dishwasher meets safety and performance standards. For example, you might see "UL Listed" or "Energy Star" symbols. These confirm that your appliance is safe and energy-efficient. It gives you peace of mind about your purchase.

The rating plate is a complete summary of your dishwasher's identity. It acts like a passport for your appliance. Always keep the information on this plate accessible. Take a photo of it and store it on your phone or computer. You can also write down all the details in a home appliance logbook. This practice ensures you have critical data whenever you need it. It makes future service or part orders straightforward. This tiny plate holds a lot of power.

### When You Still Cannot Find the Model Number

Sometimes, despite searching all the common spots, you might not find the model number. This can happen for several reasons. The label might be very faded. It could be covered by paint. It might have even fallen off completely. Do not give up if this happens. There are still ways to get the information you need for your Bosch dishwasher.

First, check your original purchase documents. These include receipts, invoices, or delivery slips. When you bought your dishwasher, the model number was likely printed on these papers. The retailer’s sales record will also have this detail. Look through your old files. Check your email for online order confirmations. Many people save these documents digitally.

If you registered your Bosch appliance after purchase, check your online account. Many manufacturers offer product registration. This allows you to store your appliance details. Log in to your Bosch account on their website. Your registered products should be listed there with their model numbers. This is a very convenient way to retrieve lost information.

Another good option is to contact Bosch customer service directly. Have any information ready that you do know. This includes the purchase date. Give them the retailer's name. You can also describe the dishwasher's color and main features. Tell them about its approximate age. They might be able to find your model using these details. They often have internal databases linked to sales records. Provide as much detail as you can.

If all else fails, a professional appliance technician might help. They have experience with many models. They may know specific quirks of certain Bosch lines. They might identify your model by its appearance and features alone. This is not a guaranteed method, but it is an option. If you have any ongoing issues like water staying in the bottom of your dishwasher, professional help might be necessary anyway.

### Using Your Model Number for Bosch Dishwasher Care and Troubleshooting

When your dishwasher shows an error code, the model number directs you. You can look up the specific code for your model online. Bosch's website provides detailed troubleshooting guides. These guides explain what each code means. They offer steps to fix the problem. This avoids guesswork. It also stops you from trying solutions that do not apply to your specific machine.

Regular maintenance is also simpler with the model number. For example, cleaning the dishwasher filter is important. Different Bosch models have different filter designs. Some filters twist out. Others slide out. Knowing your model helps you find the correct instructions. You can look up the exact process for your machine. This prevents damage from improper cleaning methods. I always recommend following the exact instructions for your model.

Ordering parts is precise with the model number. Whether it is a new spray arm, a detergent dispenser, or a control board, the model number ensures compatibility. Part numbers are tied directly to specific models. Without the model number, you might order a part that looks similar but does not fit or work correctly. This leads to frustrating returns. It causes delays in your repair.

Finally, the model number connects you to a wealth of online resources. You can find detailed parts diagrams. You can watch video tutorials specific to your model. You can also read user reviews.
