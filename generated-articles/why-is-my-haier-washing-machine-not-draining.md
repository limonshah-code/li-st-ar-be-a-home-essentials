### Clear Answer to Your Draining Problem

A Haier washing machine typically fails to drain due to a clogged drain pump filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, or a malfunctioning drain pump. Other causes include a faulty lid switch or issues with the machine's control board or pressure sensor.

## Checking the Drain Hose: Clogs and Kinks

A common reason a **Haier washing machine is not draining** is a problem with the drain hose. The drain hose carries water out of the machine. If this hose is blocked or kinked, water cannot escape. This often leads to a full drum after a wash cycle.

### Inspecting for Kinks

First, check the hose behind the washing machine. It connects to a standpipe or a laundry tub. Look for any sharp bends or kinks in the hose itself. These bends act like a dam, preventing water flow. Gently straighten the hose to remove any kinks. Make sure the hose has a smooth, downward slope towards the drain. Gravity helps water move efficiently.

Sometimes, the machine pushes too close to the wall, causing the hose to bend. Pull the machine away from the wall slightly. This provides more space for the hose. Ensure the hose hangs freely without pressure.

### Identifying Internal Blockages

Kinks are easy to spot. Internal blockages are harder to see. Over time, lint, soap residue, and small items can build up inside the drain hose. This restricts water flow. You might need to disconnect the hose to check for blockages.

Before disconnecting, always unplug the washing machine from its power source. Turn off the water supply valves too. Place a bucket or towels under the hose connection points. This catches any water that might spill. Carefully detach the hose from the machine and the drainpipe. Look inside the hose using a flashlight. Use a long, flexible brush or a straightened coat hanger to clear any debris. Run water through the hose in a sink to ensure it is clear. A clear hose allows water to flow freely again. Properly reattach the hose after cleaning.

## Inspecting the Drain Pump Filter (Coin Trap)

If your **Haier washing machine is not draining**, the drain pump filter is often the culprit. Haier washing machines, especially front-loaders, have a small filter designed to catch lint, coins, buttons, and other small items before they reach the drain pump. This filter prevents damage to the pump. Over time, this filter can become severely clogged. A clogged filter blocks water from passing through to the pump, preventing drainage.

### Locating the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter is usually located at the bottom front of your Haier washing machine. It is often behind a small access panel or a kickplate. You may need a flathead screwdriver to gently pry open this panel. Once open, you will see a round cap or a handle. This is the filter cover.

Before you open the filter, prepare for water. Place a shallow pan or several towels directly underneath the filter area. Even if the drum appears empty, water can still be trapped in the pump housing. Unscrew the filter cap slowly. Allow the water to drain into your pan. This process can be messy, so be ready with extra towels.

### Cleaning the Filter

Once the water drains, fully remove the drain pump filter. You will likely find a collection of lint, hair, coins, buttons, and perhaps even small socks. Remove all visible debris from the filter. You can rinse the filter under a faucet with warm water. Use an old toothbrush or a small brush to scrub away any stubborn residue. Make sure the filter screen is completely clear.

While the filter is out, also check the filter housing inside the machine. Reach in and feel for any objects that might have slipped past the filter. Sometimes, larger items can get stuck here. After cleaning the filter and housing, screw the filter back in tightly. Ensure it seals correctly to prevent leaks. Close the access panel. This simple cleaning often resolves the "Haier washing machine not draining" problem immediately. Regular cleaning of this filter, perhaps every few months, prevents future drainage issues.

## Troubleshooting a Malfunctioning Drain Pump

When your **Haier washing machine is not draining**, and you have checked the hose and cleaned the filter, the drain pump itself might be faulty. The drain pump is a vital component. It uses a motor to force water out of the machine through the drain hose. If the pump is not working, water remains in the drum.

### Signs of a Failing Drain Pump

One common sign of a failing drain pump is unusual noises. You might hear a humming sound, grinding noise, or no sound at all when the machine should be draining. A good pump makes a whirring sound. If you hear a loud buzzing but no water draining, the pump motor might be running but the impeller is blocked. If you hear nothing, the pump might not be getting power, or its motor is dead.

Sometimes, the machine stops mid-cycle and shows an error code. Many error codes on Haier washers relate to drainage. For example, an E2 error on a Haier washing machine can indicate a drainage problem. You can check your user manual for specific error code meanings. If your Haier washing machine keeps stopping, a drain pump issue could be the cause. More information on general stopping issues is available at [why does my Haier washing machine keep stopping](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-haier-washing-machine-keep-stopping).

### Checking the Drain Pump's Operation

To check the drain pump, you need to access it. The drain pump is usually located at the bottom of the washing machine, near the drain filter. Always disconnect power to the machine first. Lay down old towels to catch any water. You may need to tilt the machine back or remove the front or rear access panel to reach the pump.

Once you access the pump, look for any visible damage or loose wires. You can also test the pump directly if you have a multimeter, checking for continuity. However, a simpler check is to look inside the pump for obstructions. Even after cleaning the filter, a small object could bypass it and get stuck in the pump's impeller. A detailed guide on what an E2 error means on Haier washing machines can be found at [what does e2 mean on haier washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-does-e2-mean-on-haier-washing-machine). If the pump is humming but not draining, this is likely an impeller blockage.

## Addressing Blockages in the Drain Pump Impeller

A common scenario where your **Haier washing machine is not draining** involves an obstructed drain pump impeller. The impeller is a small fan-like component inside the drain pump. It spins rapidly to push water out of the machine. Even if the drain filter is clean, smaller items can sometimes bypass it or get stuck directly in the impeller. This prevents the pump from spinning freely and effectively removing water.

### Accessing the Drain Pump and Impeller

To inspect the impeller, you must first access the drain pump. This usually involves tilting the washing machine back or removing the front or rear service panel. Always unplug the washer from the power outlet and turn off water valves before starting. You should also drain any standing water from the drum manually, if possible, using a bucket and scoop or by slowly opening the drain filter.

Once you locate the drain pump, you may need to disconnect it from its hoses and electrical connections. Some pumps are easy to remove; others may require tools. Have towels ready, as more water might spill out. After removing the pump, you can usually see the impeller through an opening. Some pumps require disassembly to fully expose the impeller.

### Clearing Impeller Obstructions

Carefully examine the impeller blades. Look for any coins, hairpins, buttons, fabric scraps, or other foreign objects wrapped around or jammed within the blades. These small items can completely seize the impeller. Use pliers or tweezers to carefully remove any obstructions. Be gentle; the impeller blades can be fragile.

After clearing the obstruction, manually spin the impeller with your finger. It should spin freely and without resistance. If it feels stiff or does not move, the pump motor might be damaged, or there's another internal issue. In such cases, the drain pump might need replacement. Reassemble the pump and reconnect it to the machine. Test the washing machine to see if the drainage issue is resolved. This step often fixes the "Haier washing machine not draining" problem when other solutions fail.

## Diagnosing Issues with the Lid Switch or Door Lock

If your **Haier washing machine is not draining**, especially on top-load models, a faulty lid switch is a common cause. For front-load models, a malfunctioning door lock mechanism can be the culprit. These safety features ensure the machine operates only when the lid or door is securely closed. If the machine does not detect a closed lid or locked door, it will not proceed with cycles, including draining.

### The Role of the Lid Switch (Top-Loaders)

The lid switch is a safety device located near the hinge of the washer lid. When you close the lid, a small tab or plunger on the lid presses down on the switch. This signals to the machine's control board that the lid is closed. If the switch is broken, misaligned, or stuck, the machine thinks the lid is open. It will then refuse to spin or drain water.

To check the lid switch, unplug the washer. Visually inspect the switch and the tab on the lid. Make sure they align properly. Sometimes, the plastic tab on the lid breaks off. If the tab is intact, the switch itself might be faulty. You can often test the switch for continuity with a multimeter, but this requires electrical knowledge. If the switch clicks when pressed but the machine still does not drain, it might be an internal electrical fault with the switch. If your Haier washing machine is locked with water inside, learning [how to open a Haier washing machine when locked](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-open-haier-washing-machine-when-locked) might become necessary.

### The Door Lock Mechanism (Front-Loaders)

Front-load Haier washing machines use a door lock assembly. This assembly electrically locks the door during operation. It also communicates to the control board that the door is shut and locked. If this mechanism fails, the machine will not spin or drain water. This is a safety measure to prevent water leaks and injury.

Signs of a faulty door lock include the door not locking, the door light not illuminating, or error codes related to the door. To check, unplug the machine. Inspect the door latch and the door lock assembly on the machine's frame. Look for any visible damage or loose wires. Sometimes, objects caught in the door gasket can prevent proper sealing. Clear any debris. If the lock mechanism appears physically intact, the electronic part of the lock might be bad. In such cases, the entire door lock assembly often needs replacement.

## Examining the Pressure Sensor and Control Board

When your **Haier washing machine is not draining** and you have ruled out common mechanical issues, the problem might stem from the pressure sensor or the main control board. These components are vital for the machine's electronic operations. They control the various stages of a wash cycle, including drainage.

### How the Pressure Sensor Works

The pressure sensor, also known as the water level switch, determines the amount of water in the wash tub. It works by sensing air pressure in a small tube connected to the bottom of the tub. When water fills the tub, it compresses the air in the tube, and the sensor detects this pressure. Based on the pressure, the sensor tells the control board how much water is present. If the pressure sensor is faulty, it might incorrectly believe the tub is empty, even when it is full. This causes the machine to skip the drain cycle.

To check the pressure sensor, first unplug the washing machine. Locate the sensor, which is usually a small, disc-shaped component with a thin hose attached to it. The hose runs down to the bottom of the tub. Inspect the hose for kinks, clogs, or disconnections. A blocked hose can give false readings. Gently blow into the hose (from the sensor end) to check for blockages. You should hear air bubbling in the tub. If the hose is clear, the sensor itself might be faulty. Replacement is usually needed if the sensor is bad.

### The Role of the Main Control Board

The main control board acts as the "brain" of your Haier washing machine. It receives signals from all sensors and switches, then sends commands to components like the drain pump. If the control board is defective, it might not send the correct signal to the drain pump, even if all other parts are functional. This results in the "Haier washing machine not draining" problem.

Diagnosing a faulty control board is difficult for a DIYer. There are often no obvious visual signs of damage. Sometimes, you might see burned components or discolored areas on the board, but not always. If you have checked everything else and your washing machine still does not drain, the control board could be the culprit. Replacing a control board is often expensive. It also requires careful handling and correct installation to avoid further damage. Consider professional assistance if you suspect a control board issue.
