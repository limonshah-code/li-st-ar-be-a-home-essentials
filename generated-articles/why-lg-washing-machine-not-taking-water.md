## Resolving Your LG Washing Machine Not Taking Water Issue

Imagine the scene: You load your LG washing machine, add detergent, and press start. You expect to hear the gentle rush of water filling the drum. Instead, you hear nothing, or perhaps just a faint hum. Your LG washing machine is not taking water, and your laundry sits dry. This can be a frustrating problem, but it is often fixable. I know how important a working washing machine is for daily life.

Many common reasons exist for an LG washer to refuse water. These range from simple external factors to internal component issues. Understanding these causes helps you find a solution. This comprehensive guide will walk you through each potential problem. We will cover easy troubleshooting steps you can perform yourself. My goal is to help you get your LG washing machine filling and washing clothes again.

### Takeaway: Quick Fixes for Your LG Washer

*   **Check Water Taps:** Ensure hot and cold water supply taps are fully open.
*   **Inspect Hoses:** Look for kinks or clogs in the inlet hoses.
*   **Clean Inlet Screens:** Clear any debris from the screens inside the water inlet valves.
*   **Secure Door:** Make sure the washer door or lid is completely closed and latched.
*   **Reset Washer:** Unplug the machine for a few minutes, then plug it back in.

Your LG washing machine might not take water due to closed water supply valves, kinked inlet hoses, or clogged inlet screens. Other common culprits include a faulty water inlet valve, a broken door latch, or issues with the pressure sensor or control board. Addressing these specific areas helps you restore water flow.

## Checking Water Supply and Pressure

The most basic checks involve your home's water supply. Without proper water flow to the machine, no amount of internal repair will help. I always start here because it is quick and requires no tools. It's easy to overlook these simple points.

### Faucet Position and Water Shut-off Valves

First, confirm that your hot and cold water supply faucets are open. These are usually behind the washing machine. You will see two hoses connecting to the back of the washer. Each hose connects to a separate water tap. These taps must be fully turned on for water to enter the machine. Sometimes, they get accidentally turned off during cleaning or other tasks. I have seen this many times, and it is a common reason for no water.

*   Locate the hot and cold water taps behind your LG washing machine.
*   Turn both taps fully counter-clockwise to open them.
*   Ensure the hoses connecting to these taps are securely attached.
*   Check for any visible leaks around the connections.

If you find a tap partially closed, open it completely. Then, try running a wash cycle. This simple step often resolves the problem immediately. Remember to check both hot and cold lines, as many cycles require both.

### Low Water Pressure Concerns

Your LG washing machine needs adequate water pressure to fill properly. If the water pressure in your home is too low, the washer might not fill at all. It may also fill very slowly. This happens because the water inlet valve requires a minimum pressure to operate correctly. You can test your home's water pressure. Turn on a nearby sink faucet. Observe the flow. If the flow is weak, low water pressure could be the cause.

*   Check if other water fixtures in your home have low pressure.
*   Ensure no other appliances are running that might draw water. For instance, a running shower or dishwasher can reduce pressure.
*   If your home uses a well, check the well pump. Ensure it works correctly.
*   Consider if a neighborhood-wide water issue is occurring.

Low water pressure prevents the LG washing machine from taking water efficiently. If this is the issue, you might need to contact your water utility. Or, you might need a plumber to check your home's main water supply.

## Inspecting Inlet Hoses and Screens

Once you confirm your water supply is active and pressure is good, the next step is to examine the inlet hoses themselves. These hoses bring water from your home's supply to the washing machine. Problems here are very common. They can easily stop your LG washing machine from taking water.

### Kinked or Damaged Hoses

Water supply hoses can get kinked or bent behind the machine. This is especially true if the washer is pushed too close to the wall. A kinked hose restricts water flow significantly. Sometimes, it can block water entirely. I always recommend pulling the machine out slightly to check these hoses. Look at both the hot and cold water lines.

*   Gently pull your LG washing machine away from the wall.
*   Visually inspect both hot and cold water inlet hoses.
*   Look for any sharp bends, twists, or kinks.
*   Straighten any kinks you find. Ensure the hoses have enough space behind the machine.
*   Check for any visible damage, such as cracks or bulges, that might indicate a compromised hose.

If you find a damaged hose, it is best to replace it. A damaged hose can leak and cause water damage. Replacing hoses is a simple DIY task.

### Clogged Inlet Screens

At the point where the hoses connect to the back of the LG washing machine, there are small mesh screens. These screens prevent sediment and debris from entering the washing machine's water inlet valve. Over time, these screens can become clogged with rust, dirt, or mineral deposits. A clogged screen severely restricts water flow, leading to your LG washing machine not taking water. Cleaning these screens is a critical maintenance step.

*   Turn off both hot and cold water supply taps before disconnecting any hoses.
*   Place a towel or small bucket under the hose connections to catch any residual water.
*   Unscrew the hot and cold water inlet hoses from the back of the LG washing machine.
*   Inside the washer's water inlet openings, you will see small screens.
*   Use needle-nose pliers or tweezers to carefully pull out these screens.
*   Rinse the screens under running water to remove any debris. You can use a small brush for stubborn deposits.
*   Reinsert the clean screens and reconnect the hoses tightly.
*   Turn the water supply back on and check for leaks.

Regularly cleaning these screens helps maintain optimal water flow. It prevents future issues with your LG washer not filling. You can find more details about maintaining your LG washer here: [How to Clean an LG Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-an-lg-washing-machine) and specifically for the inlet valve: [How to Clean LG Washing Machine Water Inlet Valve](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washing-machine-water-inlet-valve).

## Addressing Water Inlet Valve Problems

If your water supply is fine and the hoses and screens are clean, the issue likely lies with the water inlet valve itself. This valve is an electrical component. It opens to allow water into the drum when signaled by the control board. If it fails, your LG washing machine will not take water.

### Testing the Inlet Valve

The water inlet valve has solenoid coils. These coils open and close the valve to let water in. If a coil is faulty, the valve will not open. You can test the valve with a multimeter if you are comfortable with basic electrical tests. Always unplug the machine first for safety. A functioning solenoid should show a specific resistance reading. The exact reading varies by model, so check your washer's service manual.

*   Disconnect the power to your LG washing machine. Safety is paramount.
*   Access the water inlet valve. It is usually located at the back of the machine, where the hoses connect.
*   Disconnect the electrical connectors from the solenoids on the valve.
*   Set your multimeter to the ohms setting.
*   Touch the probes of the multimeter to the terminals of each solenoid.
*   A healthy solenoid usually reads between 50 and 1,000 ohms. A reading of infinity or zero indicates a bad solenoid.

If any solenoid shows an incorrect reading, the entire water inlet valve likely needs replacement. A faulty valve is a common reason for an LG washing machine not taking water.

### Replacing a Faulty Valve

Replacing a water inlet valve is a manageable DIY task for many. Once you confirm the valve is faulty, acquiring the correct replacement part is the next step. Ensure the part number matches your specific LG washing machine model. Instructions for replacement are often available online.

*   **Order the Correct Part:** Make sure you get the exact replacement valve for your LG model.
*   **Disconnect Power and Water:** Unplug the washer and turn off the water supply taps.
*   **Access the Valve:** Depending on your model, you might need to remove the back panel or top lid.
*   **Remove Old Valve:** Disconnect the water hoses, electrical connectors, and any mounting screws.
*   **Install New Valve:** Attach the new valve, reconnect the electrical wires, and reattach the hoses.
*   **Test:** Restore power and water, then run a test cycle. Check for leaks immediately.

If you are unsure about performing this repair, consider contacting a professional appliance technician. Dealing with water and electricity can be risky.

## Troubleshooting Dispenser and Detergent Issues

Sometimes, the problem isn't directly with the water intake. Instead, issues with the detergent dispenser can indirectly affect water flow into the drum. The water often flows through the dispenser drawer to pick up detergent and fabric softener. If this path is blocked, your LG washing machine might not take water properly.

### Clogged Dispenser Drawer

The dispenser drawer can accumulate detergent residue and fabric softener over time. This build-up turns into a sticky, gummy substance. This can clog the pathways that water uses to enter the drum. When water encounters these blockages, it might back up or fail to enter the drum completely. Regular cleaning of this area is essential.

*   Pull out the dispenser drawer completely. Most LG models allow the drawer to be removed.
*   Visually inspect all compartments for residue or mold.
*   Use hot water and a brush to thoroughly clean all parts of the dispenser drawer.
*   Pay close attention to the small holes or nozzles where water sprays into the dispenser. Clear any blockages.
*   Clean the housing inside the machine where the drawer slides in.
*   Reinsert the clean dispenser drawer.

A clean dispenser ensures water flows freely into the machine. This step is a good part of routine maintenance. For tips on how to keep your LG washing machine clean overall, you can read [How to Clean an LG Washing Machine with Vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washing-machine-with-vinegar).

### Detergent Build-up Impacts

Beyond the dispenser drawer itself, detergent build-up can affect internal hoses and components. Especially if you use too much detergent, or a type not suitable for HE (High-Efficiency) machines, it can create excessive suds. These suds can trick the washing machine's sensors. The machine might detect too much water or suds and stop filling. This is a subtle yet significant issue.

*   Always use high-efficiency (HE) detergent in HE LG washing machines. HE detergents produce fewer suds.
*   Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for detergent dosage. Using too much is a common mistake.
*   Run a 'Tub Clean' or 'Self Clean' cycle regularly. This helps remove detergent residue from the drum and internal components.
*   Consider using a washing machine cleaner designed to remove build-up.

Proper detergent usage is crucial for the efficient operation of your LG washer. If your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water, it could be a related issue, which you can read about here: [Why Does My LG Washing Machine Keep Filling Up with Water?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-washing-machine-keep-filling-up-with-water).

## Examining Door Latch and Lid Switch

Modern washing machines, including LG models, have safety features. These features prevent the machine from operating unless the door or lid is securely closed. If the machine's control system does not detect a properly closed door, it will not begin the fill cycle. This is a very common reason for an LG washing machine not taking water.

### Securely Closing the Door

The first thing to check is simply the door itself. Ensure it is firmly shut. For front-load machines, the door must click into place. For top-load machines, the lid must be fully down. Sometimes, clothes can get caught. A small item can prevent the door from closing completely. I have found socks or small garments stuck in the door seal. This prevents the latch from engaging.

*   Open and re-close the washer door or lid firmly.
*   Listen for a distinct click, indicating the latch has engaged.
*   Check the door seal for any items of clothing or debris. Remove anything blocking the seal.
*   Ensure the washer is level. An unlevel machine can sometimes prevent the door from latching correctly.

If the door appears closed but the washer still does not fill, the problem might be with the latch or switch mechanism itself.

### Testing the Lid Switch or Door Latch

The door latch or lid switch is a safety component. It tells the washing machine's control board whether the door is closed and locked. If this switch is faulty, the machine thinks the door is open. It will not start the wash cycle or fill with water. These switches can wear out or break over time.

*   **For Top-Load Washers (Lid Switch):** The lid switch is often located under the top panel, near the hinge. You can usually test it for continuity with a multimeter when the lid is closed. A broken switch means no power signal.
*   **For Front-Load Washers (Door Latch Assembly):** The door latch assembly is more complex. It includes a locking mechanism. If the door does not lock, the machine will not fill. You might hear clicking sounds, but no lock engagement. A faulty latch often requires replacement of the entire assembly.

Accessing and testing these components might require disassembling part of the machine. If you are not comfortable with this, a professional technician can diagnose and replace it. Knowing [How to Unlock Your LG Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-unlock-your-lg-washing-machine) can be useful for troubleshooting door issues.

## Investigating Drain System Issues

It might seem counterintuitive, but problems with the drain system can prevent your LG washing machine from taking water. If the machine thinks it is still full of water, or if a siphon effect occurs, it will not fill. This is a less obvious cause but is certainly worth checking if other solutions fail.

### Siphon Effect from Drain Hose

A common drain-related issue is the "siphon effect." This happens when the drain hose is inserted too far into the standpipe or drain opening. If the hose creates a continuous path for water, the washer can effectively drain water as fast as it fills it. This results in the machine never reaching the proper water level. The machine keeps trying to fill but never succeeds.

*   Check the position of your washing machine's drain hose.
*   Ensure the drain hose is not inserted more than 6-8 inches into the standpipe or wall drain.
*   The hose should also have an air gap or be routed in a way that prevents siphoning. Many manuals suggest securing the hose with a 'U' shape higher than the drain opening.
*   Ensure the standpipe itself is not clogged. If water cannot drain properly, it might back up and trigger sensors.

Correctly positioning the drain hose is a simple adjustment that can resolve a no-fill issue. It prevents the machine from draining water while it tries to fill. If you need to know more about draining issues, you can check out [How to Get LG Washing Machine to Drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-lg-washing-machine-to-drain).

### Clogged Drain Pump Filter

While primarily related to draining, a severely clogged drain pump filter can sometimes indirectly affect the fill cycle. Some LG models have a sensor that checks for water in the drum before filling. If the machine incorrectly senses water present due to a partial drain blockage or backflow, it might refuse to fill. A clogged filter can also put stress on the drain pump, potentially affecting other systems.

*   Locate the drain pump filter on your LG washing machine. It is usually at the bottom front, behind a small access panel.
*   Place a shallow pan and towels underneath the filter housing to catch residual water.
*   Carefully unscrew and remove the filter. Be prepared for some water to come out.
*   Remove any lint, coins, buttons, or other debris caught in the filter.
*   Clean the filter thoroughly under running water.
*   Reinsert the clean filter and secure the access panel.

Cleaning the drain pump filter is an important maintenance task. It improves drainage and prevents potential issues with your LG washing machine's wash cycles.

## LG Washing Machine Electronic and Sensor Failures

If you have checked all the mechanical and water supply components, the problem might be electronic. Modern LG washing machines rely heavily on sensors and control boards to operate. A malfunction in these areas can prevent the machine from filling. These issues are more complex and often require professional diagnosis.

### Control Board Malfunctions

The control board, or main PCB (Printed Circuit Board), is the brain of your LG washing machine. It sends signals to all components, including the water inlet valve. If the control board is faulty, it might not send the correct signal to the valve, or it might receive incorrect readings from sensors. This leads to the LG washing machine not taking water. Symptoms of a bad control board can include:

*   The machine not responding to commands.
*   Displaying error codes.
*   Intermittent issues with cycles.
*   Not filling with water even when all other components are fine.

Diagnosing a control board issue usually involves professional expertise. Sometimes, a simple reset can resolve temporary glitches. You can try unplugging the washer for a few minutes. Then plug it back in. This often clears minor electronic errors. For detailed instructions, see [How to Reset Your LG Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-your-lg-washing-machine). If a reset does not work, the board might need replacement. This is usually an expensive repair.

### Pressure Sensor Errors

LG washing machines use a pressure sensor (also known as a pressure switch or water level sensor). This sensor measures the water level in the tub. It does this by detecting the air pressure in a tube connected to the bottom of the tub. If this sensor is faulty, it might incorrectly tell the control board that the tub is full. Alternatively, it might report that the tub is empty, even when water is present. This incorrect information prevents the washer from filling.

*   **Symptoms:** The machine might try to fill but immediately stop, or it might not attempt to fill at all. You might get specific error codes related to water level.
*   **Checking:** The sensor connects via a thin air tube to the tub. This tube can become clogged. Ensure the tube is clear of debris or kinks.
*   **Testing:** Testing the pressure sensor requires a multimeter. However, it is more complex than testing the inlet valve. It often involves checking resistance changes based on pressure.

If the pressure sensor is faulty, the control board will not know when to open the water inlet valve. This prevents water from entering the drum. Replacement of this sensor is usually required if it fails. If your LG washing machine is beeping constantly, it might be signaling an error code related to this or another component.
