## How To Store Window Air Conditioner For Winter

As the crisp autumn air arrives, thoughts often turn from cooling to cozy. Your trusty window air conditioner, which worked hard all summer, now needs proper care. Knowing how to store window air conditioner for winter is essential. This protects your investment, prevents damage, and ensures it runs efficiently next season. Proper storage extends your unit's life and saves you money on potential repairs or replacements. Let us explore the best methods for preparing your AC unit for its long winter nap.

### Takeaway:

*   Thoroughly clean and dry your window AC unit before storage.
*   Decide whether to store the unit indoors or leave it in the window.
*   Protect your AC from moisture, dust, and extreme temperatures.
*   Proper storage extends your unit's lifespan and maintains its efficiency.

Properly storing your window air conditioner for winter involves thorough cleaning, ensuring it is completely dry, and choosing a protected storage location. You must remove the unit from the window if storing indoors. Otherwise, use a weather-resistant cover if leaving it installed. These steps prevent damage and ensure reliable performance next summer.

### Why Proper Winter Storage Matters for Your Window AC Unit

It seems simple to just unplug your window air conditioner and forget about it until next summer. However, neglecting proper winter storage can lead to many problems. Your AC unit is an investment, and like any valuable appliance, it needs seasonal care. I have seen many units fail prematurely because they were not properly stored.

One major issue is damage from extreme temperatures. Freezing temperatures can harm internal components, especially if any moisture remains inside. Plastic parts can become brittle, and metal parts may corrode. Another concern is pests. Mice, insects, and other critters look for warm, sheltered spots during winter. An unsealed AC unit can become a perfect home for them, leading to chewed wires, nests, and unpleasant odors.

Dust and dirt also accumulate over time. Storing a dirty unit allows grime to solidify and become harder to remove. This reduces efficiency when you start it up again. By taking the time to store your window air conditioner for winter correctly, you avoid these problems. You help maintain its cooling power and extend its useful life. This practice saves you money in the long run.

### Deciding Where to Store Your Window Air Conditioner

One important decision is where you will store your window air conditioner for the colder months. You have two main options: indoor storage or leaving it installed in the window. Each option has its own benefits and drawbacks. Your choice depends on factors like your climate, storage space, and the unit's installation method.

Indoor storage offers the most protection. When you bring your unit inside, it is safe from harsh weather, temperature fluctuations, and direct exposure to snow or ice. This option is ideal for climates with severe winters. It also protects the unit from pests that might try to nest inside. Indoor storage helps keep internal components in better condition. It might be a hassle to remove and reinstall the unit each year. If you are wondering if your AC needs to be in a window, you can learn more about [whether a window air conditioner has to be in a window](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-window-air-conditioner-has-to-be-in-window). This is useful if you are considering alternative placement for storage or general use.

Leaving the unit in the window can be more convenient. This option avoids the heavy lifting of removal and reinstallation. However, it exposes the unit to the elements. If you choose this path, you must protect it thoroughly. A proper winter cover is essential to shield it from rain, snow, and cold. Without a cover, moisture can seep in and cause rust or electrical damage. Also, cold air can leak into your home through the unit. This can increase your heating bills. Consider your specific situation carefully before making this choice.

### Thorough Cleaning Before Storage

Cleaning your window air conditioner is a critical step before putting it away for the winter. You cannot skip this part. A clean unit stores better and performs better next season. Dirt, dust, and mold can accumulate during the cooling season. If left uncleaned, these substances can cause damage or create an unhealthy environment when you restart the unit. This also helps prevent odors from developing during storage. I always make sure my AC is spotless before I put it away.

First, unplug the unit from its power source. Safety comes first. Then, remove the air filter. Most filters can be washed with warm, soapy water. Let them air dry completely before putting them back. Some filters are disposable, so you might need a new one for next season. You can learn more about [how to clean your air conditioner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-conditioner) for general tips.

Next, clean the coils. The evaporator coils are inside the front of the unit. The condenser coils are on the back. Use a coil cleaner spray or a soft brush and mild detergent. Be gentle to avoid bending the delicate fins. You can find detailed instructions on [how to clean mold from your window air conditioner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-window-air-conditioner) if you notice any growth. Make sure all parts are completely dry before you store the unit. Any trapped moisture can lead to mold or rust.

*   **Filter Cleaning:** Remove, wash with warm, soapy water, and air dry. Replace disposable filters.
*   **Coil Cleaning:** Use a soft brush or coil cleaner. Clean both evaporator and condenser coils.
*   **Drainage:** Ensure the drain pan is empty. Tilt the unit slightly to drain any residual water.
*   **Exterior Wipe Down:** Clean the outer casing with a damp cloth.

### Preparing Your AC for Indoor Storage

If you decide to remove your window air conditioner for indoor storage, prepare it properly. This method provides maximum protection. It ensures your unit stays in top condition. First, carefully remove the unit from the window. Window AC units are heavy. Get help if you need it. Secure any mounting brackets or side panels before moving the unit.

After removal, give the unit one final check for any lingering moisture. You want it completely dry. Tilt the unit slightly in different directions to drain any water from the pan or internal components. Use towels to wipe up any remaining drips. Place the unit on its side for a few hours if possible, to aid drainage. This step is crucial to prevent mold or rust during storage.

Once dry, wrap the unit to protect it from dust and potential impact. You can use an old blanket, a tarp, or heavy-duty plastic sheeting. Secure the wrapping with tape or bungee cords. This creates a protective barrier. Store the unit in a cool, dry place. Basements, garages, or closets are good options. Avoid areas with extreme temperature fluctuations or high humidity. Placing the unit on a raised platform, like a pallet, can protect it from ground moisture. This ensures it remains safe until next summer.

### Preparing Your AC for Outdoor Storage

Sometimes, removing the window air conditioner is not a practical option. You might live in an apartment or simply lack indoor storage space. In these cases, you can leave the unit installed and prepare it for outdoor storage. This requires specific steps to protect it from the elements. Ignoring these steps can lead to significant damage. I have seen many units ruined when left outside without proper preparation.

The most important step is to use a high-quality, weather-resistant cover. This cover should fit snugly over the entire exterior of the unit. It must protect against rain, snow, ice, and strong winds. Look for covers made from durable, waterproof materials. They often have elastic hems or straps to secure them tightly. A good cover prevents moisture from entering the unit and causing rust or electrical issues. Many people ask [is it good to cover your window air conditioner in the winter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-it-good-to-cover-your-window-air-conditioner-in-the-winter)? The answer is yes, absolutely, especially for outdoor storage.

Beyond the cover, consider internal protection. While a cover protects the exterior, some cold air can still enter your home through the gaps around the unit. Use foam insulation or a rigid board to block these gaps from the inside. This improves your home's energy efficiency during winter. It also helps prevent cold drafts. Ensure the unit is tilted slightly outward to allow any moisture to drain away. This prevents water from pooling inside the unit or against your window frame. Regularly check the cover throughout winter to ensure it remains secure and undamaged.

### Tips for Optimal AC Longevity and Performance

Proper storage is not a one-time event; it is part of a larger maintenance cycle. To ensure your window air conditioner lasts for many years, think about its overall care. Beyond winter storage, consistent maintenance helps maintain performance and efficiency. I have found that a little effort each season goes a long way. This approach keeps your unit running like new.

During the cooling season, regularly clean the air filter. A dirty filter restricts airflow and makes the unit work harder. This increases energy consumption and reduces cooling capacity. You can easily clean most filters with water and mild soap. Some units also benefit from periodic coil cleaning during the summer months. This removes dust and debris that can build up.

Before storing the unit, perform a final inspection. Look for any loose screws, damaged fins, or signs of wear. Address minor issues now to prevent them from becoming major problems later. When you bring the unit out again next spring, inspect it once more. Check for any damage that might have occurred during storage. Clean it again before installation. This ensures it is ready for optimal performance. These simple steps maximize your AC unit's lifespan. They also help you avoid unexpected breakdowns when the heat returns.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Storing Your Window AC

Storing your window air conditioner for winter might seem straightforward. However, common mistakes can lead to damage or reduced performance. Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to do. I have seen people make these errors, often leading to costly repairs. Learning from these mistakes saves you time and money.

First, never store a wet or damp unit. Moisture is the enemy of electronics and metal. It can cause rust, corrosion, and the growth of mold or mildew. Always ensure every part of your AC unit is completely dry before wrapping it up. This may mean allowing it to air dry for a full day or using fans. Second, do not store the unit in an unsealed environment. Dust, dirt, and pests can easily get inside an exposed unit. This leads to blockages, damage to internal components, and unsanitary conditions. Always use a proper cover or wrap when storing.

Another mistake is placing heavy objects on top of the stored unit. The casing and internal components are not designed to bear significant weight. This can cause cracks, dents, or internal damage. Always store the unit on a flat, stable surface, free from obstructions. Finally, avoid storing it in areas with extreme temperature fluctuations. Attics or sheds that get very hot in summer and very cold in winter can stress the materials. A stable, moderate temperature is best for long-term storage. By avoiding these common pitfalls, you protect your AC unit effectively.
