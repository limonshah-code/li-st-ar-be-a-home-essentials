### Key Factors When Choosing Stair Carpet: Durability, Style, and Safety

When looking for carpet for a staircase, several factors are critical. Durability is a top concern because stairs experience heavy foot traffic. You need a carpet that can withstand constant use without showing wear quickly. Nylon and wool are popular choices for their resilience.

Style is equally important. The carpet you choose impacts the entire look of your entryway or hallway. Consider colors and patterns that complement your home's decor. A runner offers a different aesthetic than wall-towall carpeting. Think about how the carpet integrates with existing flooring.

Safety features are essential for staircases. A good carpet provides traction, reducing slip hazards. A firm, dense pile helps with stability. Proper padding also plays a role in safety and comfort. It helps to keep a carpet down and prevent shifting, which is important for safety on stairs. You want to make sure the carpet stays securely in place. Consider carpet that is stain-resistant. This makes cleaning easier and extends the carpet's life.
