### Clear Answer to Main Query

You can cook ham in a convection microwave by using its convection bake function. Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Place the ham in a microwave-safe dish. Cook it until its internal temperature reaches 140°F (60°C) for pre-cooked ham. This method offers even heating and a crispy exterior.

## Why Cook Ham in a Convection Microwave?

Cooking ham in a convection microwave provides many benefits. It offers a convenient and fast way to prepare a holiday meal or a simple dinner. Convection technology cooks food more evenly than traditional microwaves. This helps your ham brown beautifully. It also keeps the inside moist and tender.

This appliance is a space-saver. It is perfect for smaller kitchens or when your main oven is occupied. You can prepare side dishes in the main oven while the ham cooks in the convection microwave. This ensures everything finishes at the same time. The convection microwave uses less energy than a full-size oven. This makes it an energy-efficient choice for cooking ham.

Many people consider the convection microwave a versatile kitchen tool. It bakes, roasts, and browns food. For ham, this means you get a golden crust without drying out the meat. This method is simpler than you might imagine. It delivers excellent results for your family and guests.

## Understanding Your Convection Microwave Oven

A convection microwave oven combines two cooking methods. It uses microwave energy for fast heating. It also uses convection heat for even baking and browning. Convection cooking circulates hot air around the food. This creates a miniature oven effect inside your microwave. This circulation cooks food from all sides.

You need to know how your specific model works. Most convection microwaves have a dedicated "Convection Bake" or "Roast" setting. You set the temperature just like a regular oven. They often require preheating for best results. This ensures the cooking cavity reaches the correct temperature before you put the ham inside. Understanding [how does a convection oven cook differently](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-does-convection-oven-cook-differently) is key.

Some models come with pre-set programs for different types of meat. Always refer to your appliance manual. It provides specific instructions for your model. For instance, [how to use a Samsung microwave convection oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-samsung-microwave-convection-oven) or [how to use an LG microwave convection oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-lg-microwave-convection-oven) might vary slightly. Familiarize yourself with the convection features before you start cooking your ham. This knowledge helps you achieve the best outcome.

## Choosing the Right Ham for Convection Cooking

Selecting the correct ham is crucial for success. For convection microwave cooking, a fully cooked, bone-in or boneless ham works best. Fully cooked hams only need reheating to a safe serving temperature. This reduces cooking time significantly. Uncooked hams take much longer and might not be suitable for all convection microwave models due to size and extended cooking needs.

Consider the size of your ham. It must fit comfortably inside your convection microwave. Measure your appliance's interior before buying the ham. A ham too large will not cook evenly. A ham between 3 to 7 pounds is typically ideal for most standard convection microwaves. Larger hams may require a traditional oven.

**Types of Ham to Consider:**

*   **Spiral-Cut Ham:** These hams are pre-sliced, making serving easy. They also absorb glazes well.
*   **Half Ham (Bone-in or Boneless):** A half ham is often a good size for a convection microwave. Boneless hams are easier to slice. Bone-in hams often have more flavor.
*   **Ham Steak/Portion:** For very small meals, a thick ham steak can be cooked quickly.

Always check the label to ensure the ham is fully cooked. This prevents undercooking and ensures a quick, safe meal. Choosing the right ham sets you up for a delicious result.

## Essential Preparation for Perfect Ham

Proper preparation makes a big difference in how your ham cooks. First, remove your ham from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking. This allows it to come closer to room temperature. A warmer ham cooks more evenly. This also prevents the outside from drying out while the inside warms up.

Next, choose a suitable baking dish. You need a microwave-safe and oven-safe dish that fits your ham. Glass or ceramic dishes work well. Make sure the dish has sides to catch any drippings. You may not need a roasting rack if your ham already has a flat side or if you plan to baste it frequently. However, if you want to avoid direct contact with the bottom of the pan, a small rack or even some vegetables like carrots and celery can elevate the ham slightly. Learning [how to place ham in baking pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-place-ham-in-baking-pan) correctly ensures even cooking.

Scoring the ham is another important step. Use a sharp knife to cut shallow diamond patterns into the fat cap. Do not cut into the meat itself. This scoring helps the glaze penetrate the ham. It also allows the fat to render nicely, creating a crispy surface. Some hams come pre-scored, which saves you a step.

Finally, prepare your glaze. Many hams come with a glaze packet. You can also make your own. Common glaze ingredients include brown sugar, mustard, honey, and fruit juices. Apply about half of the glaze to the ham before cooking begins. Reserve the rest for later. This initial layer gives flavor and helps create a lovely crust.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Cooking Ham in Convection Mode

Cooking ham in a convection microwave is straightforward. Follow these steps for a perfectly cooked, juicy ham.

**1. Preheat the Convection Microwave:**
   *   Turn on your convection microwave.
   *   Select the "Convection" or "Bake" mode.
   *   Set the temperature to 325°F (160°C).
   *   Allow the oven to preheat fully. This usually takes 10-15 minutes. Preheating is crucial for even cooking and browning.

**2. Prepare the Ham:**
   *   Place your prepared ham, cut side down if applicable, into a microwave-safe and oven-safe baking dish. The dish should be large enough to catch drippings but still fit inside the microwave.
   *   Pour about 1/2 cup of water, broth, or fruit juice (like apple or pineapple) into the bottom of the dish. This creates steam. It helps keep the ham moist during cooking.
   *   Cover the ham and the dish tightly with aluminum foil. This prevents the ham from drying out and helps it heat through evenly.

**3. Initial Cooking Phase:**
   *   Carefully place the covered ham dish into the preheated convection microwave.
   *   For a pre-cooked ham, cook for approximately 10-15 minutes per pound.
   *   For example, a 5-pound ham would cook for 50-75 minutes initially.
   *   Check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer after about 45 minutes for a smaller ham. The target temperature for a fully cooked ham is 140°F (60°C).

**4. Glazing and Final Cooking:**
   *   Once the ham is within 10-15 degrees of your target temperature, remove the foil.
   *   Apply your prepared glaze evenly over the ham.
   *   Return the ham to the convection microwave, uncovered.
   *   Continue cooking for another 15-30 minutes. The glaze will caramelize. The ham will get a nice golden-brown crust.
   *   Monitor closely to prevent burning of the glaze.

**5. Resting the Ham:**
   *   Once the ham reaches 140°F (60°C) internal temperature, remove it from the oven.
   *   Cover it loosely with foil.
   *   Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. The ham becomes more tender and flavorful.

Always use a reliable meat thermometer. Insert it into the thickest part of the ham, avoiding the bone. This ensures the ham is safely heated through.

## Troubleshooting Common Ham Cooking Issues

Even with clear instructions, issues can arise. Knowing how to fix common problems ensures your ham turns out perfectly.

### Ham is Dry

A dry ham is often a result of overcooking or not enough moisture.
*   **Solution:** Ensure you do not overcook the ham. Use a meat thermometer to pull the ham exactly when it reaches 140°F (60°C). Add liquid to the bottom of your baking dish. You can use water, chicken broth, or fruit juice. Covering the ham with foil for most of the cooking time also helps. This traps steam and keeps the ham moist. Remember to baste your ham regularly with its own juices or additional glaze.

### Uneven Cooking

Sometimes, parts of the ham cook faster than others. This often happens if the ham is not rotated or if the microwave has hot spots.
*   **Solution:** Rotate the ham dish halfway through the cooking time. If your convection microwave has a turntable, ensure it is working properly. If you are cooking a large ham, consider turning it by hand. This helps ensure all sides get even heat exposure. Using a liquid in the pan also helps conduct heat more evenly.

### Glaze is Burning

A sweet glaze can burn easily, especially towards the end of cooking.
*   **Solution:** Apply most of the glaze only after the ham has cooked for some time and the foil is removed. If you notice the glaze browning too quickly, you can loosely cover just the top of the ham with a small piece of foil. You can also lower the temperature slightly during the final glazing period. Watch it closely.

### Ham Not Browning

If your ham looks pale, it might not be getting enough convection browning.
*   **Solution:** Ensure you removed the foil for the last 15-30 minutes of cooking. This allows the dry heat to brown the surface. You can also briefly increase the temperature to 350°F (175°C) for the last 10 minutes. Do this only if the internal temperature is safe and you watch it closely. A good glaze will also help with browning.

### Internal Temperature Too Low

If your ham is not reaching the desired 140°F (60°C), it needs more time.
*   **Solution:** Continue cooking the ham. Reduce the temperature slightly to 300°F (150°C) if it is close to the target. This prevents the outside from drying out while the inside warms up. Always insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the ham, avoiding the bone, for an accurate reading.

Addressing these issues helps you cook a perfect ham every time.
