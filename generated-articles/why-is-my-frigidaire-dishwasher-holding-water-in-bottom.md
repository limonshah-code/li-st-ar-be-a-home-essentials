## Solving Your Frigidaire Dishwasher's Standing Water Problem

Washing dishes by hand is never fun. It is especially frustrating when your Frigidaire dishwasher, a machine designed to simplify your life, leaves a pool of dirty water at the bottom. I understand how annoying this can be. You open the door, expecting sparkling clean dishes, only to find them submerged. This common problem, a Frigidaire dishwasher holding water in the bottom, signals a drainage issue.

Do not worry, you are not alone in facing this challenge. Many homeowners encounter this specific problem. This guide will walk you through the most common reasons your Frigidaire dishwasher holds water. We will also provide clear, actionable steps to diagnose and fix the issue yourself. You can restore your dishwasher's performance and get back to enjoying truly clean dishes.

### Takeaway

*   **Check the Filter System:** Regularly clean your dishwasher's filter and sump area to prevent blockages from food debris.
*   **Inspect the Drain Hose:** Ensure the drain hose is free of kinks, clogs, and is correctly installed with a high loop or air gap.
*   **Clear the Drain Pump:** Look for foreign objects obstructing the drain pump impeller or a failing pump motor.
*   **Verify Garbage Disposal:** If connected, confirm your garbage disposal is clear of food waste before running the dishwasher.
*   **Examine the Check Valve:** Ensure the check valve near the drain pump is not stuck or blocked, allowing water to flow back.

Your Frigidaire dishwasher holds water in the bottom primarily due to drainage obstructions. Common culprits include a clogged filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, a jammed or faulty drain pump, or an issue with your garbage disposal or air gap connection. Addressing these blockages is key to restoring proper function.

### The Clogged Filter and Sump Area

One of the most frequent reasons a Frigidaire dishwasher holds water is a clogged filter or a dirty sump area. Over time, food particles, grease, and detergent residue accumulate here. This buildup prevents water from properly draining out of the dishwasher tub. It is a very common oversight in routine appliance maintenance.

Your dishwasher's filter system is its first line of defense against debris. It traps larger food scraps before they can reach the drain pump. When this filter becomes excessively dirty, it acts like a dam, blocking water flow. I always recommend checking this component first when I hear about standing water.

#### How to Access and Clean Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Filter

Accessing the filter is a simple process on most Frigidaire models. First, you need to open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dish rack. This gives you clear access to the bottom of the tub. You will usually see a cylindrical filter assembly or a flat filter screen.

Most Frigidaire dishwashers use a two-part filtration system. This system includes a coarse filter and a fine micro-filter. Carefully twist or lift the filter assembly to remove it from its housing. Once removed, you will likely see a collection of food scraps and grime.

Now, it is time for cleaning. Take the filter components to your sink. Rinse them thoroughly under warm running water. You can use a soft brush or sponge with a bit of dish soap to scrub away stubborn residue. Make sure you remove all visible debris from both the coarse and fine filters.

While the filter is out, take a moment to inspect the sump area. This is the small well where the filter sits. Shine a flashlight into the sump to check for any large pieces of food or broken glass. These items can block the drain opening, even if the filter is clean. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe out any grime or standing water from the sump.

Reassemble the filter system in reverse order, ensuring it clicks securely into place. A loose filter can also cause drainage problems or allow debris into the pump. Regular cleaning of your filter, perhaps once a month or as needed, helps prevent future issues. This simple maintenance step can significantly extend your dishwasher's lifespan. By maintaining a clean filter, you also improve the overall washing performance of your Frigidaire dishwasher. A clear filter lets water circulate properly, leading to cleaner dishes every time.

### Obstructed Dishwasher Drain Hose

After checking the filter, the next most common culprit for a Frigidaire dishwasher holding water is an obstructed drain hose. This hose connects your dishwasher to your home's drain system, often through a garbage disposal or a dedicated sink drain. If this hose is kinked, clogged, or improperly installed, water cannot exit the dishwasher. This problem is surprisingly common, yet often overlooked.

Drain hoses can develop clogs from soap scum, grease buildup, or food particles that bypass the filter. A physical kink in the hose, perhaps from the dishwasher being pushed too far back or heavy items sitting on it, also restricts water flow. It is essential to inspect the entire length of the hose for any such issues. This can require pulling the appliance out from its cabinet.

#### Inspecting and Clearing Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Drain Hose

Begin by disconnecting your Frigidaire dishwasher from its power supply. This is a crucial safety step before you start any inspection. Next, you will need to gently pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet recess. Most dishwashers have adjustable legs and are not overly heavy, but it helps to have assistance. Be careful not to damage the floor.

Once the dishwasher is accessible, locate the drain hose. It is usually a corrugated or smooth plastic hose, approximately 1-inch in diameter. It connects from the back of the dishwasher to either a T-fitting under your sink or directly to a garbage disposal. Follow the hose's path from the dishwasher to its connection point. Look for any visible kinks or sharp bends along its length. Straighten any kinks you find, ensuring the hose has a smooth, unobstructed path.

Next, you need to check for internal clogs. Disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the drain connection point. Be ready for some residual water to spill out. It is a good idea to have a bucket and towels handy. Once disconnected, you can try flushing water through the hose from a sink. If water does not flow freely, you have a clog.

You can use a long, flexible brush, like a drain snake, to dislodge any blockage within the hose. Carefully push the brush through the hose until you feel resistance. Work the brush back and forth to break up the clog. Alternatively, you can mix a solution of baking soda and vinegar, pour it into the hose, and let it sit for 30 minutes before flushing. For stubborn clogs, a plumber's snake might be necessary, but use caution to avoid damaging the hose.

After clearing any blockages, inspect the hose for any signs of damage or cracks. A damaged hose could lead to leaks, even if it is not clogged. If you notice any issues, replace the hose. When reinstalling, ensure the hose is positioned with a "high loop." This means the highest point of the hose should be above the dishwasher's drain connection. This high loop prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It also stops water from the sink drain from siphoning into the dishwasher. Proper installation is key for preventing your [Frigidaire dishwasher from holding water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-frigidaire-dishwasher-holding-water-in-bottom) again.

Many issues with [Samsung dishwashers holding water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-holding-water-in-the-bottom) or [LG dishwashers having water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) are also due to drain hose issues. The principles are similar across different brands. Always ensure a clear, correctly installed drain hose.

### Problems with the Drain Pump or Impeller

If your Frigidaire dishwasher is still holding water after checking the filter and drain hose, the issue might lie with the drain pump or its impeller. The drain pump is a vital component. It forcefully expels water from the dishwasher tub at the end of a wash cycle. If this pump malfunctions, water cannot be removed, leading to standing water.

The drain pump has an impeller, a small fan-like component, that spins rapidly to push water out. Sometimes, foreign objects like broken glass, small plastic pieces, or even large food debris can get past the filter. These items can then jam the impeller, preventing it from spinning. Other times, the pump motor itself can fail, meaning it simply does not receive power or has burned out. Diagnosing a drain pump issue requires a bit more effort than checking the filter or hose.

#### Inspecting and Troubleshooting Your Frigidaire Dishwasher Drain Pump

Before starting any work on the drain pump, disconnect your Frigidaire dishwasher from its power source. Safety is always the first priority when dealing with appliances. You will need to access the drain pump, which is typically located at the bottom of the dishwasher, often beneath the sump area. This usually means pulling the dishwasher out and tilting it or carefully laying it on its back. Make sure to have towels ready to catch any residual water.

Once you have access, locate the drain pump. It is usually a circular or cylindrical component attached to the sump. You might need to remove a protective cover or unscrew some fasteners. Look for the impeller, which is part of the pump. Visually inspect the impeller for any foreign objects. Small pieces of bone, fruit pits, or plastic can easily jam it. Use needle-nose pliers or a pair of tweezers to carefully remove any obstructions you find. Be gentle to avoid damaging the impeller blades.

After clearing any visible debris, manually try to turn the impeller. It should turn freely with a little resistance. If it feels stiff or does not move at all, it might still be jammed or the motor bearings might be seized. If the impeller is clear and moves freely, the problem could be with the pump's motor or electrical connections. Use a multimeter to test for continuity and proper voltage at the pump's terminals. This step confirms if the pump is receiving power and if its internal windings are intact. If there is no continuity or inconsistent voltage, the pump likely needs replacement.

A failing drain pump often makes unusual noises before it completely stops working. You might hear a humming sound without any water moving, or a grinding noise if the impeller is struggling. If your [Frigidaire dishwasher has power but won't start](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-dishwasher-have-power-but-wont-start), a seized drain pump can sometimes be the cause. The control board may prevent a cycle from starting if it detects a pump issue. If you determine the pump motor is faulty, it will need to be replaced. Replacing a drain pump can be a DIY task for someone comfortable with appliance repair, but it might also be a job for a professional. Replacing the entire drain pump assembly is often easier than trying to repair just the motor. Remember to purchase the correct replacement part specifically for your Frigidaire model.

### Garbage Disposal and Air Gap Issues

Many Frigidaire dishwashers connect directly to a garbage disposal unit under the kitchen sink. This connection point can become a significant source of drainage problems if not properly managed. If your garbage disposal is clogged or misused, it can cause a severe backup, resulting in your dishwasher holding water in the bottom. This is a common and often overlooked cause.

Another critical component related to dishwasher drainage, especially in areas with specific plumbing codes, is the air gap. The air gap is a small, chrome cylinder usually found on your kitchen sink countertop, near the faucet. Its purpose is to prevent contaminated sink water from siphoning back into the dishwasher. If the air gap becomes clogged, it can also impede proper drainage.

#### Addressing Your Garbage Disposal for Dishwasher Drainage

If your Frigidaire dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, ensuring the disposal is clear is your first step. Before running your dishwasher, always run the garbage disposal for about 30 seconds with cold water. This clears any food debris that might be sitting in the disposal, which could otherwise block the dishwasher's drain line. Small pieces of food, like rice or coffee grounds, can easily accumulate and form a clog.

If the disposal is completely clogged and not draining sink water, this will definitely prevent your dishwasher from draining. You will need to clear the disposal's clog first. Turn off the disposal's power. Use a flashlight to look inside and carefully remove any visible obstructions. Do not use your hands unless the power is off. For stubborn clogs, use a garbage disposal wrench from the bottom to manually turn the blades, or try a plunger. After clearing, run cold water and the disposal again to ensure it is free-flowing.

Also, check the knockout plug inside the garbage disposal's dishwasher inlet. When a new garbage disposal is installed, a plastic plug in the dishwasher connection port must be "knocked out" to allow water to flow from the dishwasher. If this plug was never removed during installation, or if it somehow re-lodged, your dishwasher will not drain. You will need to disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal and check for this plug inside the disposal's inlet port. Use a screwdriver and hammer to punch it out if it is present.

#### Inspecting and Clearing Your Dishwasher's Air Gap

If your Frigidaire dishwasher uses an air gap, inspect it for clogs. First, twist off the chrome cap from the air gap unit on your countertop. Then, remove the inner plastic cap. You will see two hoses connected to the air gap. One hose comes from the dishwasher, and the other goes to the garbage disposal or sink drain.

Look for any food debris or slimy buildup inside the air gap unit. These blockages prevent air from entering the system, which is necessary for proper drainage. Use a small brush or a paperclip to clear out any gunk you find. Also, check the hoses connected to the air gap for any visible clogs near the connection points. You might need to detach the hoses to clear them fully.

Once cleared, reassemble the air gap unit. Run a small amount of water through your sink to check if the air gap bubbles. This indicates it is working correctly. If your [GE dishwasher is holding water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ge-dishwasher-holding-water-in-the-bottom), or any other brand, these two components – the garbage disposal and the air gap – are often primary suspects due to their direct involvement in the drainage path. Addressing these can often resolve the standing water problem quickly.

### Malfunctioning Check Valve

A component that often goes unnoticed, but is crucial for proper dishwasher drainage, is the check valve. The check valve's main purpose is simple: it is a one-way valve that allows water to flow out of the dishwasher but prevents it from flowing back in. If this valve becomes clogged with debris or gets stuck in a closed position, dirty water from the drain line can easily re-enter your Frigidaire dishwasher, leading to standing water in the bottom.

This valve acts as a barrier, ensuring that once water has been pumped out, it stays out. When it malfunctions, you might notice that your dishwasher drains partially, but then water slowly seeps back in, leaving a murky pool. It is not as common as a clogged filter or hose, but it is a definite possibility for drainage issues. Checking this component requires accessing the drain pump area.

#### Locating and Inspecting Your Dishwasher's Check Valve

To inspect the check valve, you will need to first disconnect your Frigidaire dishwasher from its power supply. This is important for your safety. The check valve is typically located very close to, or sometimes integrated into, the drain pump assembly. You will usually find it at the discharge side of the pump, where the water exits the pump and enters the drain hose.

You will likely need to pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet and possibly tilt it or lay it on its side to gain access to the underside. Be careful not to damage any plumbing or electrical connections. Once you have located the drain pump, look for a small, often rubber or plastic, flapper valve or a small ball check valve. It might be housed within a small fitting or a dedicated chamber near the pump's outlet.

Once you have located the check valve, carefully remove it from its housing. Some check valves are simply pushed into place, while others might be held by a clamp or a screw. Inspect the valve thoroughly. Look for any food particles, grease, or other debris that might be preventing it from opening or closing properly. These small obstructions can cause the valve to stick open, allowing water to flow back into the tub.

Also, examine the valve for any signs of damage or wear. The rubber flap might be brittle or torn, or the plastic components might be cracked. If the valve itself is damaged, it will not be able to create a proper seal. This allows water to return to the dishwasher. If you find any debris, gently clean the valve under running water. Use a soft brush or a paperclip to dislodge any stuck particles. If the valve is damaged, it cannot be repaired and must be replaced.

Fortunately, check valves are generally inexpensive parts. You can purchase a replacement specifically designed for your Frigidaire dishwasher model. Reinstall the clean or new check valve, ensuring it is properly oriented according to the manufacturer's instructions. Incorrect orientation will prevent it from functioning correctly. Once reinstalled, reattach any hoses or covers, push the dishwasher back into place, and reconnect the power. Test the dishwasher with a short rinse cycle to verify proper drainage. A functioning check valve is essential to prevent backflow and keep your Frigidaire dishwasher tub dry after a cycle.

### Incorrect Drain Hose Installation (High Loop)

A common, yet frequently overlooked, reason for your Frigidaire dishwasher holding water in the bottom is incorrect drain hose installation. Many people are unaware of the critical importance of a proper "high loop" or the presence of an air gap in the dishwasher's drain line. Without one of these, water can easily flow back into the dishwasher from your sink drain or garbage disposal. This results in standing water even after a cycle should have completed.

The purpose of a high loop is to create an elevated point in the drain hose that is higher than the connection point to your sink drain or garbage disposal. This elevation prevents dirty drain water from siphoning back into the dishwasher tub due to gravity. It also prevents water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher during heavy use, like when you fill the sink with water. If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, the high loop is just as important.

#### Ensuring Proper High Loop or Air Gap Installation

To check for proper drain hose installation, first, ensure your Frigidaire dishwasher is disconnected from its power source for safety. Pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet a few inches or completely, depending on how your hose is routed. Locate the drain hose coming from the back of the dishwasher. It is usually routed either to a garbage disposal or directly to a plumbing drain under the sink.

Observe the path of the drain hose. The highest point of the hose should be at least 32 inches from the floor, or as high as possible under the countertop, even looping up and securing to the underside of the counter before dropping down to the drain connection. If the hose runs directly from the dishwasher to the drain connection without an upward loop, it lacks a high loop. This direct connection creates a siphoning effect, pulling standing water from the sink or disposal back into the dishwasher.

If you find no high loop, you can create one. Gently pull slack in the drain hose from under the sink. Use a plumbing strap, a large cable tie, or a screw with a pipe hanger to secure the highest point of the drain hose to the underside of your kitchen counter. Ensure the loop is above the drain connection point of your sink or garbage disposal. The goal is to make gravity work for you, not against you.

In some jurisdictions, local plumbing codes require an air gap device on the countertop instead of a high loop. If you have an air gap, ensure it is installed correctly and not bypassed. The air gap serves the same purpose as a high loop but provides an even more robust backflow prevention mechanism. It physically breaks the connection between the dishwasher's drain and the sink's drain, preventing any siphoning. If your air gap is clogged, as discussed in a previous section, it will also prevent proper drainage.

Even if your [Frigidaire dishwasher is leaking from the bottom of the door](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-frigidaire-dishwasher-leaking-from-the-bottom-of-the-door), a high loop problem can sometimes contribute. Improper drainage can cause water to back up and find its way out through seals. Correcting the high loop installation is a simple, no-cost fix that can resolve standing water issues and prevent future problems with your Frigidaire dishwasher.

### Other Less Common Electrical or Sensor Issues

While physical obstructions are the most common causes for a Frigidaire dishwasher holding water, sometimes the problem can stem from less obvious electrical or sensor issues. These problems are usually more complex and might require professional diagnosis. However, understanding their potential role can help you decide when to seek expert help. It is worth briefly considering these possibilities if other troubleshooting steps fail.

The dishwasher's control board acts as the "brain" of the appliance. It sends signals to various components, including the drain pump, telling them when to activate. A faulty control board might not send the correct signal to the drain pump, preventing it from turning on or completing its cycle. Similarly, sensors, such as the turbidity sensor or the flood sensor, can provide incorrect readings. This might trick the dishwasher into thinking it has drained, or conversely, detect a false flood condition that shuts down operations prematurely.

#### Diagnosing Electrical and Sensor Malfunctions

Diagnosing electrical issues requires caution and a good understanding of appliance wiring. Always disconnect the Frigidaire dishwasher from power before attempting any electrical checks. Start by checking the circuit breaker in your home's electrical panel. Sometimes, a tripped breaker can prevent the dishwasher from receiving continuous power, leading to incomplete cycles and standing water. Reset the breaker and try running a cycle. If it trips again, there is a deeper electrical problem.

Next, you might check the wiring connections to the drain pump and control board. Loose or corroded wires can interrupt power flow. Gently inspect connectors, ensuring they are snug and free of rust or burn marks. If you own a multimeter, you can test for continuity in the wiring leading to the drain pump. Lack of continuity suggests a broken wire.

A faulty drain pump motor could also be an electrical issue. If the motor winding is burned out or shorted, the pump will not operate. While you can check for continuity, replacing the pump assembly is usually the solution for a motor failure. If the control board is the problem, you might observe other unusual behaviors. These include incorrect cycle timings, unresponsive buttons, or error codes appearing on the display. Unfortunately, a control board usually cannot be repaired. It needs replacement, which can be an expensive fix.

Sensor issues are harder to diagnose without specialized tools. A turbidity sensor, which measures water clarity, if faulty, might signal the dishwasher to keep washing, potentially overfilling, or not draining at the right time. A flood switch, designed to detect excessive water and prevent leaks, could falsely activate, stopping the drain cycle. If you suspect a sensor, you might find error codes in your dishwasher's manual that point to specific sensor failures. Often, replacing a sensor means replacing the entire component it is integrated with.

For most homeowners, delving into complex electrical or sensor diagnostics is beyond a comfortable DIY level. If you have systematically gone through all the mechanical checks – filter, drain hose, pump, air gap, garbage disposal – and your Frigidaire dishwasher still holds water, it is probably time to call a qualified appliance technician. They possess the necessary diagnostic tools and expertise to pinpoint the exact electrical or sensor issue and safely perform the repair. Attempting complex electrical repairs without proper knowledge can be dangerous and cause further damage to your appliance.
