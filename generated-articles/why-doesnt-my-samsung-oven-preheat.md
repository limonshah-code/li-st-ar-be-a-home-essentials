### Takeaway

*   **Check Power First:** Always confirm your oven has power and the circuit breaker is on.
*   **Inspect Heating Elements:** Look for visible damage on both bake and broil elements in electric models.
*   **Listen for Igniter:** Gas ovens need a working igniter to start the flame.
*   **Test Temperature Sensor:** A faulty sensor gives incorrect readings, preventing proper heating.
*   **Review Door Latch:** The oven door must close and latch correctly for heating to start.
*   **Consider Control Board:** The main control board can fail and stop all oven functions.
*   **Seek Professional Help:** Call a certified technician for complex internal component replacements.

### Why Does My Samsung Oven Not Preheat?

Your Samsung oven likely fails to preheat due to a faulty heating element (electric models) or a defective gas igniter (gas models). Other common causes include a broken temperature sensor, issues with the control board, a faulty oven door latch, or problems with the power supply and circuit breaker.
