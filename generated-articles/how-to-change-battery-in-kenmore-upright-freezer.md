### What Batteries Do Kenmore Upright Freezers Use?

You might think about a battery when your freezer has issues. Many people ask, "Does my Kenmore upright freezer have a battery?" The answer is often not straightforward. Most basic Kenmore upright freezers do not have a large, user-replaceable battery for their main cooling system. The freezer plugs into an electrical outlet for power.

However, some advanced models or specific features might use a small battery. This battery usually serves specialized functions. It is not for the primary operation of the freezer. Understanding these potential battery types is the first step.

One common battery type is a coin cell battery, like a CR2032. This battery often powers the control board. It helps save settings during brief power outages. This means your custom temperature settings remain intact. Without it, you might need to reprogram settings after a power interruption.

Another possibility is a battery for an internal alarm system. Some freezers have alarms for open doors or high temperatures. A small battery might power these alarms. This backup ensures the alarm works even if the main power fails. This keeps your food safe by alerting you to problems. It is rare, but some Kenmore models may include this feature.

You might also have an external monitoring device. Some users add smart thermometers or alarm systems to their freezers. These external devices almost always use batteries. These batteries are separate from the freezer's internal parts. They are user-installed and user-replaceable. Always check your freezer's manual to understand its specific features.

#### Types of Batteries You Might Encounter

You might encounter different battery types. Knowing them helps you prepare for replacement. Each type serves a specific function.

*   **Coin Cell Batteries (e.g., CR2032):** These are small, flat, and round. They often power memory functions on control boards. They keep track of settings like temperature or modes. You usually find them on a circuit board.
*   **Alkaline Batteries (AA, AAA):** Less common for internal freezer functions. If present, they might power a specific sensor or a separate alarm unit. These are usually easier to find and replace.
*   **Rechargeable Batteries:** Some high-end models might use small rechargeable batteries. These act as a very short-term backup for specific electronics. They are rarely user-replaceable.

Always consult your Kenmore upright freezer's user manual. It provides exact details on any internal batteries. The manual also guides you on how to access and replace them. Without the manual, identifying the correct battery can be difficult. Knowing your freezer model number is also very helpful.
