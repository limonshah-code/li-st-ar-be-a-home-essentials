## Samsung Dishwasher Won't Turn Off with LC Code? Here's Why.

A persistent dishwasher that refuses to power down is frustrating. If your Samsung dishwasher displays an "LC Code" and continues to run, it signals a specific problem. This error code points to a leak detection issue. Understanding why your Samsung dishwasher shows an LC code and stays on helps you diagnose the problem. This guide explores the reasons your Samsung dishwasher won't turn off with the LC code. We offer clear steps to address this common appliance glitch.

### Takeaway

When your Samsung dishwasher refuses to turn off and displays an LC code, the issue typically stems from a detected water leak. Here is a summary of key actions:

*   **Inspect for Visible Leaks:** Check the floor around and under the dishwasher for water.
*   **Locate the Float Switch:** This sensor detects water in the drip pan. Ensure it is not stuck.
*   **Examine Hoses and Connections:** Look for loose or damaged water supply and drain hoses.
*   **Check the Sump and Gaskets:** A faulty sump or worn door gasket can cause leaks.
*   **Clear Blockages:** Debris in the filter or drain can lead to overflow and leak activation.
*   **Reset the Dishwasher:** A power cycle can clear temporary errors.
*   **Contact Support:** If the issue persists, professional help may be necessary.

A Samsung dishwasher displaying an LC code and refusing to turn off indicates the leak detection system has activated. This usually means water has entered the dishwasher's base pan, triggering the float switch. The dishwasher stays on, often trying to drain, as a safety measure to prevent water damage until the leak is addressed and the sensor resets.

### Understanding the Samsung Dishwasher LC Code: A Safety Feature

The LC code on your Samsung dishwasher is a crucial safety mechanism. This code stands for "Leakage Check" or "Leakage Current." It means the dishwasher has detected water where it should not be. When water collects in the dishwasher's drip pan at the bottom, a float switch activates. This switch then sends a signal to the main control board. The dishwasher stops its cycle and often runs the drain pump continuously. This prevents further water from escaping and causing damage to your floors or cabinets.

The LC code activation is not random. It directly responds to a sensor indicating a leak. This design protects your home from potential water damage. Ignoring the LC code can lead to more significant issues down the line. It is important to address the problem promptly. Knowing what the LC code means is the first step in troubleshooting the issue. This error serves as an early warning system. It tells you to investigate a water leak before it escalates.

Sometimes, the LC code appears without an obvious leak. This can make troubleshooting confusing. Factors like a faulty sensor or a tiny, intermittent drip might be at play. We will discuss these possibilities and how to approach them. The key is to understand the LC code's purpose. It always points to water where it should not be, whether visible or not. You need to stop the leak for the dishwasher to return to normal operation.

The continuous running of the drain pump aims to clear any standing water. This also acts as a safeguard. It prevents water from overflowing the drip pan. Your Samsung dishwasher actively protects your home when this code appears. My experience tells me that most users will not see a flood. They just see the dishwasher not turning off. This is a good sign the safety system is working. You must find the source of the leak for a proper fix.

### Common Causes of the LC Code and Continuous Operation

Several issues can cause your Samsung dishwasher to display an LC code and refuse to turn off. Pinpointing the exact cause helps you fix the problem efficiently. Most often, the problem relates to actual water leaks. Sometimes, a sensor issue can trick the dishwasher. Let's look at the most common culprits.

One primary reason is a **damaged water supply hose or drain hose**. These hoses connect to your dishwasher. Over time, they can crack, become loose, or corrode. A small drip from a hose connection can trickle into the base pan. This activates the float switch. Inspect these hoses carefully for any signs of wear or leakage. Pay attention to the points where they connect to the dishwasher and your home's plumbing. A loose clamp can also be the problem.

Another frequent cause is a **faulty door gasket or seal**. The gasket creates a watertight seal around the dishwasher door. If it is worn, torn, or improperly seated, water can seep out during a wash cycle. This water then drips into the base pan. Check the entire length of the gasket around the door opening. Look for any gaps or damage. Cleaning the gasket regularly helps maintain its integrity. Sometimes, food particles get stuck in the gasket, preventing a proper seal.

The **float switch** itself can be a problem. This small component sits in the base of your dishwasher. It detects water in the drip pan. If the switch gets stuck in an "up" position, it will continuously signal a leak. This happens even if there is no actual water present. This leads to a false LC code. Debris can sometimes lodge under the float. Gently press the float switch down to ensure it moves freely. My own experience has shown this to be a quick fix in some cases.

A **clogged or damaged sump assembly** can also cause issues. The sump is the basin at the bottom of the dishwasher where water collects. If the filter inside the sump is clogged, water can overflow. This activates the leak sensor. A crack in the sump itself, though less common, will definitely cause a leak. Regularly cleaning your dishwasher's filter is a simple preventative step. You can learn [where is filter in Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-filter-in-samsung-dishwasher) for cleaning.

Finally, internal components like the **wash pump or drain pump** can develop leaks. These leaks are often harder to spot. If a pump seal fails, water can escape directly into the base pan. This triggers the LC code. This usually requires more complex disassembly to inspect. A pump issue often comes with unusual noises during operation. For example, if your dishwasher is making strange noises, it might be a pump issue.

Identifying the exact source of the leak is crucial. Take your time to thoroughly inspect each of these areas. Sometimes, the leak is very small and takes time to gather enough water to trigger the sensor. You can also explore why your Samsung dishwasher might have an LC code but no visible leak for more insights. This helps cover all possibilities. Understanding these common causes helps you resolve the LC code issue.

### Troubleshooting Steps: What to Do First

When your Samsung dishwasher shows an LC code and won't turn off, the first thing to do is remain calm. This problem usually has a clear solution. Follow these troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve the issue. These steps help you methodically check common problem areas.

**1. Power Cycle the Dishwasher:**
Your first action should be to reset the appliance. This clears temporary glitches. Turn off the dishwasher at the circuit breaker for at least five minutes. Then, turn the power back on. This hard reset can sometimes clear the LC code if it was a false alarm. It is a simple step, but often effective. This is similar to [how to reset s e code on samsung refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-s-e-code-on-samsung-refrigerator).

**2. Check for Visible Water Leaks:**
Look for water on the floor around the dishwasher. Pull the dishwasher out slightly if you can. Inspect the area underneath and behind the unit. Even a small puddle indicates a leak. A damp spot can be enough to trigger the sensor. Use a flashlight for a better view. You might find the source immediately.

**3. Inspect the Base Pan and Float Switch:**
The LC code means water is in the base pan. You need to access this area. Turn off the power before proceeding. Remove the lower kick plate at the front of the dishwasher. Look into the base pan. You will likely see water there. The float switch is a small plastic disc or lever. It sits in the pan. Make sure it moves freely. Sometimes debris gets under it, holding it up. Clear any obstructions and gently push it down. This ensures it is not stuck.

**4. Examine Water Supply and Drain Hoses:**
With the dishwasher pulled out, check the water inlet hose and drain hose. Look for kinks, cracks, or loose connections. Tighten any loose fittings. Replace any hoses that show signs of damage. A drip from a loose connection is a common cause of base pan water. Ensure the drain hose is properly routed and not pinched. This is a common point of failure.

**5. Check the Dishwasher Door Gasket:**
Open the dishwasher door. Examine the rubber gasket that seals the door. Look for tears, cracks, or signs of wear. Clean the gasket thoroughly. Food debris can accumulate and prevent a tight seal. If the gasket is damaged, it needs replacement. A worn gasket allows water to escape. This water will collect in the base pan.

**6. Clear the Sump and Filter:**
A clogged filter or sump can cause water to back up and overflow. This leads to leaks. Remove the lower spray arm and access the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Clean the filter and surrounding area thoroughly. Ensure no debris obstructs the sump. A clean sump helps proper drainage. My dishwasher runs better after a good filter cleaning.

Perform these steps systematically. Each action helps narrow down the problem. Remember to disconnect power before any physical inspection. This ensures your safety. If you find water, you must dry out the base pan. The LC code will persist until the pan is dry and the leak is fixed.

### Addressing Specific Leak Sources

Once you have identified a potential leak source, you need to address it directly. The LC code will not clear until the leak is stopped and the base pan is dry. Here are common leak sources and how to fix them.

**1. Leaky Water Inlet Valve or Hose Connections:**
The water inlet valve controls water flow into the dishwasher. If this valve leaks, water goes directly into the base pan. Look for drips from the valve itself or its connections. Tighten any loose hose connections. If the valve itself is leaking, it usually requires replacement. You might need a wrench to tighten connections. Always ensure the water supply is off before working on these parts. A new washer might solve a connection drip.

**2. Damaged Door Seal or Gasket:**
A worn-out door gasket is a frequent culprit. This gasket forms the watertight seal around the dishwasher door. If water leaks from the door, it falls to the bottom of the unit. Replace the gasket if it is torn, cracked, or deformed. This job is often straightforward. You can usually pull the old one out and push a new one into the groove. Make sure the new gasket sits snugly. This creates a proper seal.

**3. Issues with the Drain Hose:**
The drain hose carries dirty water out of the dishwasher. A crack or loose connection in this hose can cause water to leak during the drain cycle. Inspect the entire length of the drain hose. Check both ends where it connects to the dishwasher and the sink drain or garbage disposal. Tighten clamps or replace the hose if damaged. Ensure no sharp bends or kinks exist in the hose. These can cause stress and eventual leaks.

**4. Faulty Sump or Pump Seals:**
The sump assembly is the collection point for water in the dishwasher. If the pump seals within the sump fail, water can leak into the base pan. This is a more complex repair. It often involves disassembling the pump and motor assembly. If you see water accumulating directly under the pump or motor, this is likely the issue. This might require professional help. Replacing the seals or the entire pump assembly could be necessary. It is crucial for preventing more water damage.

**5. Cracked Tub or Spray Arm Assembly:**
Less common, but a crack in the dishwasher tub itself can cause a leak. This is usually visible. Also, a damaged spray arm can cause water to spray erratically, hitting the door or other components incorrectly and causing splashes that lead to leaks. Inspect the inside of the dishwasher tub for any visible cracks. Check the spray arms for cracks or broken nozzles. A cracked tub often requires professional repair or unit replacement.

**6. Overfilling Due to Water Inlet Valve Malfunction:**
Sometimes, the dishwasher overfills with water. This happens if the water inlet valve does not close properly. The extra water overflows into the base pan. This triggers the LC code. You might also notice more water than usual inside the tub at the end of a cycle. Replacing the water inlet valve usually resolves this problem. This also means you have an issue with the [Samsung dishwasher not turning on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-not-turning-on) completely, as it's stuck in a loop.

After fixing the leak source, you must thoroughly dry the base pan. Use towels or a wet vacuum to remove all standing water. You can also let it air dry for several hours. The LC code will not disappear until the base pan is completely dry and the float switch resets. Sometimes, tipping the dishwasher slightly can help drain any remaining water from the base. This process ensures the sensor is clear.

If you fixed a leak and the code still appears, your dishwasher might be stuck in a loop. You can find more information about [why is my Samsung dishwasher running on its own](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-running-on-its-own). This often means the sensor still detects moisture. Be patient and ensure complete dryness.

### The Importance of Drying the Base Pan and Resetting

After you identify and fix the leak source, a critical step remains: drying the base pan. The LC code will persist on your Samsung dishwasher until the base pan is completely dry. The float switch needs to return to its default, down position. This indicates no water is present. Simply stopping the leak is not enough to clear the error.

Accessing the base pan usually involves removing the lower kick plate at the front of the dishwasher. Use towels or a sponge to soak up all standing water. For larger amounts of water, a wet/dry shop vacuum works best. Ensure you reach every corner of the pan. Even a small amount of residual water can keep the float switch activated. I use a bright flashlight to check for damp spots.

Once the visible water is gone, allow the base pan to air dry thoroughly. This might take several hours. You can speed up the drying process. Use a fan to blow air into the open base area. Some technicians even gently tip the dishwasher forward by a few inches. This can help drain any hidden water that might be trapped. Be careful when tipping the appliance. Ensure it is unplugged and secure.

After the pan is dry and the float switch is down, you need to reset the dishwasher. The easiest way to do this is a power cycle. Turn off the circuit breaker that supplies power to the dishwasher. Wait for at least 5-10 minutes. Then, turn the power back on. This allows the control board to reset. The LC code should clear if the leak is resolved and the pan is dry. If the code reappears, it means one of two things: either there's still water in the pan, or the leak source hasn't been completely fixed. Or perhaps, the float switch itself is faulty.

A common mistake is fixing the leak but forgetting to dry the pan. The dishwasher will continue to display the LC code. It will also continue its draining cycle. This cycle is designed to prevent further damage. It does not stop until the sensor reports the area clear. This process ensures your home remains protected. It is a crucial part of resolving the LC error. This is also important if your Samsung dishwasher is flashing normal and won't turn off.

Remember, safety first. Always disconnect power before accessing internal components. This protects you from electrical shock. A dry base pan is the final step in resolving the LC code.

### When to Call a Professional for Samsung Dishwasher Repair

You have tried all the troubleshooting steps. You inspected your Samsung dishwasher for leaks, dried the base pan, and reset the appliance. But the LC code still appears, and your dishwasher won't turn off. This is when it is time to call a professional. Some issues are simply too complex for a DIY fix. Or they require specialized tools and expertise.

Here are scenarios where professional help is advisable:

**1. Persistent LC Code Despite No Visible Leak:**
You have meticulously checked for water and found nothing. The base pan is completely dry. Yet, the LC code remains. This could indicate a faulty float switch or a problem with the main control board. Diagnosing these requires technical knowledge. A professional can test these components. They can replace them if necessary. Sometimes, an internal component like the heater or pump has a very slow, intermittent leak. This is hard to detect.

**2. Internal Component Leaks:**
If you suspect a leak from an internal part, like the wash pump, drain pump, or circulation motor, it is best to call a technician. These components are complex. Replacing seals or the entire unit needs specific tools and know-how. Attempting such repairs without experience can cause more damage. It can also void your warranty.

**3. Electrical or Control Board Issues:**
The LC code could stem from a malfunctioning control board. This might send incorrect signals or fail to register the float switch's proper position. Control board replacement is often costly. It requires careful handling. Professionals understand the wiring diagrams and programming. They ensure proper installation. My own rule of thumb is, if it involves circuit boards, call an expert.

**4. Lack of Confidence or Tools:**
If you do not feel comfortable performing the troubleshooting steps, or if you lack the necessary tools, do not hesitate to call for help. Dishwashers involve water and electricity. Incorrect repairs can be dangerous. A professional has the right equipment and safety training. They can provide peace of mind.

If your Samsung dishwasher is still under warranty, performing DIY repairs might void it. Check your warranty terms before attempting major fixes. Calling an authorized Samsung service technician ensures your warranty remains intact. They use genuine parts. They also provide certified service.

A technician can quickly diagnose the problem. They have diagnostic equipment. They also have experience with common Samsung dishwasher issues. They can determine if the problem is a genuine leak, a faulty sensor, or a control board issue. For example, if you faced a [Samsung dishwasher error code 4C](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-samsung-dishwasher-error-code-4c), a professional is often the best route. They carry common replacement parts. This speeds up the repair process. They can get your dishwasher working again efficiently.

Investing in professional repair can save you time and prevent further damage. It ensures the problem is fixed correctly. This gives your appliance a longer lifespan. Do not ignore the LC code. It is an important indicator. Timely action prevents bigger problems.

### Preventative Measures to Avoid Future LC Codes

Once you fix the LC code on your Samsung dishwasher, you want to keep it from coming back. Implementing preventative measures helps extend the life of your appliance. These simple habits can save you from future headaches and repair costs. My own dishwasher has benefited greatly from these regular checks.

**1. Regular Dishwasher Cleaning:**
Food particles, grease, and mineral deposits can build up inside your dishwasher. This buildup can clog filters and spray arms. It can also deteriorate seals. Clean your dishwasher regularly. Run an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner or white vinegar. Clean the filter at the bottom of the tub weekly or bi-weekly. A clean filter prevents water from backing up and potentially overflowing. You can refer to guides on [where is filter in Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-filter-in-samsung-dishwasher) for proper cleaning instructions.

**2. Inspect Hoses and Connections Annually:**
Make it a habit to check your water supply and drain hoses once a year. Look for any signs of wear, cracks, or kinks. Feel for dampness around the connections. Tighten any loose hose clamps. Replace hoses that show visible damage. Hoses are under constant pressure. They can degrade over time. Early detection of damage prevents major leaks.

**3. Check the Door Gasket Frequently:**
The door gasket is crucial for containing water. Wipe down the door gasket after each use. This removes food particles and grime that can accumulate. Inspect it for tears or deformities. A simple visual check helps you spot issues early. If it feels hard or brittle, it might be time for replacement. This prevents water from seeping out during cycles.

**4. Do Not Overload the Dishwasher:**
Overloading your dishwasher can prevent proper water circulation. It can also cause water to spray out of the tub and onto the floor. This activates the leak sensor. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for loading. Ensure dishes do not block the spray arms or detergent dispenser. Proper loading prevents splashing. It also ensures efficient cleaning.

**5. Avoid Excessive Detergent:**
Using too much detergent can create excessive suds. These suds can overflow the dishwasher tub. They can then spill into the base pan. Use the recommended amount of detergent for your water hardness. High-efficiency detergents require less product. Always use detergent specifically designed for dishwashers. Hand dish soap causes major oversudsing.

**6. Install a Water Leak Detector:**
Consider installing an inexpensive water leak detector. Place it in the base pan of your dishwasher. These devices sound an alarm when they detect moisture. This gives you an early warning before the leak becomes a major problem. They are a good extra layer of protection. This is especially helpful if your dishwasher is in an area not regularly checked.

**7. Periodic Inspection of the Float Switch:**
Occasionally, remove the kick plate and check the float switch. Ensure it moves freely. Clear any debris that might accumulate around it. A stuck float switch can give false LC codes. This check takes only a few minutes. It can save you from unnecessary troubleshooting.

These proactive steps minimize the risk of your Samsung dishwasher developing an LC code again. Regular maintenance is key to appliance longevity. It is better to prevent a problem than to fix one. These measures contribute to a smoothly running dishwasher.

### Other Samsung Dishwasher Errors and Their Relation to LC Code

The LC code specifically points to a leak, but other Samsung dishwasher error codes exist. Some of these errors can indirectly cause or be related to an LC code. Understanding them helps in comprehensive troubleshooting. Sometimes one error leads to another.

**1. 4C/4E Error (Water Supply Issue):**
The 4C or 4E error indicates a water supply problem. This might mean low water pressure, a clogged inlet filter, or a faulty water inlet valve. If the dishwasher does not get enough water, it can sometimes try to compensate, or the cycle might get interrupted. An incomplete cycle or a faulty water inlet valve that leaks while not fully open can lead to water pooling and triggering the LC code. If you face a [Samsung dishwasher error code 4C](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-samsung-dishwasher-error-code-4c), address it promptly to avoid potential water issues.

**2. 5C/5E Error (Drainage Issue):**
The 5C or 5E error signals a drainage problem. This means the dishwasher is not draining properly. Common causes include a clogged drain filter, a kinked drain hose, or a faulty drain pump. If water cannot drain, it will accumulate in the bottom of the tub. Eventually, it can overflow into the base pan. This directly triggers the LC code. A blocked drain can cause water to back up and spill over. This is a common pathway to an LC code.

**3. OC/OE Error (Overflow Error):**
The OC or OE error directly relates to an overflow. This code appears when the water level inside the dishwasher exceeds a safe limit. This can happen due to a faulty water inlet valve, a clogged float switch, or excessive suds. When the dishwasher overfills, water naturally spills into the base pan. This then activates the float switch, leading to the LC code. The OC/OE code often precedes an LC code because the overflow causes the leak detection system to engage.

**4. HE/tE Error (Heating Element/Temperature Sensor):**
These errors relate to the heating element or temperature sensor. While not directly causing leaks, issues with heating can affect water temperature. This might lead to inefficient cleaning cycles. It could potentially impact how water interacts with seals over time. An extremely hot wash might accelerate gasket wear. While less direct, maintaining proper heating function is part of overall dishwasher health.

**5. PC Error (Pressure Sensor Error):**
Some Samsung models use a pressure sensor to monitor water levels. If this sensor malfunctions, the dishwasher might overfill or underfill. An overfill directly leads to water in the base pan and the LC code. This sensor ensures the correct amount of water enters the tub. A faulty sensor can cause significant operational issues.

It is important to address any error code promptly. Ignoring one error can lead to a cascade of problems. This might include the dreaded LC code. Understanding these interconnections helps you troubleshoot more effectively. Always check the specific error code your Samsung dishwasher displays. Then, consult your appliance manual for its precise meaning. This systematic approach will ensure a full resolution.

### Advanced Troubleshooting and Component Testing

For those comfortable with more advanced diagnostics, you can test specific components once you have isolated a potential issue. This requires a multimeter and a basic understanding of electrical circuits. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before attempting any tests. My personal rule is, if I am unsure, I stop and get professional help.

**1. Testing the Float Switch:**
The float switch is a
