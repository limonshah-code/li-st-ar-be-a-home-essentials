## Why Your Samsung Dishwasher Hums: Common Causes

There is nothing quite like the sound of a well-running kitchen. So, when your Samsung dishwasher starts making an unexpected humming noise, it can certainly get your attention. I understand that concern. This common issue often signals something is not quite right inside your appliance. A humming sound from your Samsung dishwasher can indicate various problems, from minor clogs to more serious component wear.

This guide will help you understand why your Samsung dishwasher might be humming. We will cover the usual suspects that cause this noise. You will learn how to identify the source of the hum. We also provide clear, actionable steps to troubleshoot and fix these issues. This article helps you restore peace to your kitchen.

### Takeaway

*   **Normal Sounds:** Recognize the difference between normal operational sounds and problematic humming.
*   **Check Filters and Drains:** Inspect and clean the filter assembly and drain pump for clogs.
*   **Listen to Pumps:** Identify if the drain pump or circulation pump is struggling or failing.
*   **Inspect Water Inlet:** Ensure the water inlet valve functions properly and has good water pressure.
*   **Consider Professional Help:** Know when the issue requires a certified technician, especially for internal motor problems.

Your Samsung dishwasher hums because an internal component works harder than it should or has an obstruction. Common culprits include a struggling drain pump, a worn circulation pump, a faulty water inlet valve, or blockages in filters and spray arms. Identifying the specific sound helps pinpoint the exact problem.

## Understanding Dishwasher Sounds: Normal Hum Versus Problematic Noise

When your Samsung dishwasher runs, it makes sounds. Some sounds are completely normal. You might hear a gentle hum as water circulates. There could be a quiet whirring sound during the wash cycle. The drain pump also makes a specific noise when it expels water. These sounds mean your dishwasher is working as intended. They are part of its normal operation.

However, a different type of hum signals a problem. This hum might be louder than usual. It could also have a low pitch. Sometimes, it sounds like a strained motor. This problematic hum often indicates a component struggles. It might be trying to push water past a blockage. Or, a part inside could be wearing out. Knowing the difference helps you decide if you need to act. Pay attention to the sound's volume and consistency. A constant, loud hum that does not stop after a few minutes is often a red flag. It is important to distinguish these sounds early on. This helps you prevent minor issues from becoming major repairs.

You might notice the hum changes during different cycle stages. If it hums during filling, the water inlet valve might be the cause. If it hums when draining, the drain pump is likely the problem. A hum during the wash cycle points to the circulation pump or clogs. Carefully listening helps narrow down the possibilities. Do not ignore persistent or unusual humming.

## Troubleshooting the Drain Pump: Why It Might Hum Loudly

The drain pump is a key component in your Samsung dishwasher. Its job is to remove dirty water from the wash tub. When the drain pump works correctly, it makes a distinct whirring sound during the drain cycle. However, if you hear a loud humming noise during or after the wash cycle, the drain pump might be struggling. This specific hum often means the pump is trying to push water, but something blocks it.

Common reasons for a loud humming drain pump include clogs. Food particles or small objects can get stuck in the pump impeller. This prevents the impeller from spinning freely. The motor then strains, creating the humming sound. You can usually inspect the drain pump filter and the pump area for obstructions. Clear any debris you find. Sometimes, the drain hose also has a blockage, which puts stress on the pump. You can access the pump filter by checking your dishwasher's bottom. For detailed steps on how to keep this part clean, you can refer to our guide on [how to clean your Samsung dishwasher pump filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-samsung-dishwasher-pump-filter).

To troubleshoot, first disconnect power to your dishwasher. Then, remove the lower spray arm and filter assembly. Look for any foreign objects. If the pump impeller is visible, check if anything wraps around it. You might need to remove more parts to get a clear view. If the hum persists after clearing debris, the pump motor itself might be failing. A failing motor often draws power but cannot spin. This creates a persistent hum. In such cases, the pump usually needs replacement.

## Investigating the Circulation Pump (Wash Motor) Issues

Your Samsung dishwasher has another important pump: the circulation pump. This pump, also known as the wash motor, moves water through the spray arms. It ensures your dishes get clean. If this pump makes a loud humming sound, it suggests a problem. This hum typically occurs during the main wash cycle. It sounds like a motor straining to work.

A common reason for a humming circulation pump is blockages. Large food scraps or small items can enter the pump assembly. These items can restrict the impeller's movement. When this happens, the motor strains to push water, creating the humming noise. You can often check for such obstructions by inspecting the filter system and the area around the pump intake. Sometimes, debris gets past the filters and causes issues deeper inside the pump. This situation requires more careful inspection.

Another cause is wear and tear on the pump itself. Over time, the motor bearings can wear out. This causes friction and a humming sound. If the humming is accompanied by a grinding noise, it often indicates bearing failure. In some cases, the pump's impeller might be damaged. This damage affects its ability to move water efficiently. While clearing minor blockages is a DIY task, replacing a worn-out circulation pump often requires professional help. If you need to disassemble parts of your dishwasher for inspection, our guide on [how to put a Samsung dishwasher back together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-samsung-dishwasher-back-together) might be helpful, as the process for taking it apart is often the reverse.

## Checking the Water Inlet Valve: A Potential Hum Source

The water inlet valve controls water flow into your Samsung dishwasher. This valve opens at the beginning of the cycle to fill the tub. If you hear a humming noise specifically when your dishwasher starts filling, the water inlet valve could be the culprit. This hum might sound like a buzzing or vibrating noise. It usually stops once the dishwasher fills with water.

The water inlet valve might hum for a few reasons. One common reason is low water pressure. If water pressure is too low, the valve might struggle to open fully. This struggle can cause it to vibrate and hum. Check your home's water pressure to rule this out. Make sure the water supply line to the dishwasher is fully open. Another reason is debris blocking the valve's screen. The valve has a small filter screen to catch sediment from the water supply. If this screen gets clogged, water flow is restricted. The valve then strains to let water through, causing the hum.

You can often clean the screen of the water inlet valve. First, turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. Then, disconnect the water supply hose from the valve. You will see the small screen inside the valve's inlet. Carefully remove and clean this screen. Use a small brush to clear any debris. If the valve itself is faulty, it might hum even with good water pressure and a clean screen. An aging valve can fail internally. This internal failure prevents it from opening or closing smoothly. In such cases, replacing the water inlet valve is necessary. This is a repair many homeowners can do.

## Inspecting Clogged Filters and Spray Arms

Clogged filters and spray arms can cause your Samsung dishwasher to hum. The dishwasher filter system is vital. It traps food particles and debris. This prevents them from recirculating onto your dishes. If the filters become clogged, water cannot flow freely. The pumps then have to work harder to push water. This increased strain results in a distinct humming sound. The hum often indicates the system is under stress.

You should regularly clean your dishwasher filters. My recommendation is to clean them at least once a month. To do this, locate the filter assembly at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Twist or unclip the components according to your model's manual. Rinse them under running water. Use a soft brush to remove stubborn food residue. For more specific guidance, our article on [how to clean your Samsung dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-samsung) provides detailed instructions. If you are unsure where to find it, consult our guide on [where the filter is in a Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-filter-in-samsung-dishwasher).

Spray arms also play a crucial role. They have small holes that jet water onto your dishes. These holes can become clogged with food particles or mineral deposits. When spray arm holes are blocked, water pressure builds up. The circulation pump then strains against this resistance. This strain can also lead to a humming noise. Regularly check the spray arm holes. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear any blockages. Ensure the spray arms spin freely by hand. A well-maintained filter system and clean spray arms ensure efficient water circulation. This prevents undue strain on the pumps and eliminates unnecessary humming.

## Addressing Motor Bearing Wear: A Deeper Problem

Sometimes, the humming sound from your Samsung dishwasher points to a deeper issue: worn motor bearings. The motor in your dishwasher has bearings that allow its internal components to spin smoothly. Over time, these bearings can wear out. This wear creates increased friction. The friction then produces a loud, often grinding, humming sound. This particular hum usually indicates a serious mechanical problem.

You might notice the hum becomes louder or changes pitch during different parts of the cycle. It might also be present even when the dishwasher is not actively moving water. This is because the motor itself is struggling due to the worn bearings. Unlike clogs or simple obstructions, worn motor bearings are an internal component failure. This issue means the motor assembly likely needs replacement. This type of repair is more complex than routine maintenance. It often requires disassembling a significant portion of the dishwasher.

Attempting to replace motor bearings without proper tools or experience can lead to further damage. For instance, the circulation pump or drain pump might be integrated with the motor assembly. Replacing the whole assembly can be costly. If you suspect motor bearing wear, it is best to consult a certified appliance technician. They have the expertise to diagnose the problem accurately. They also have the necessary tools to perform the repair safely. Continuing to run a dishwasher with worn motor bearings can lead to complete motor failure. This can cause more extensive damage to your appliance.
