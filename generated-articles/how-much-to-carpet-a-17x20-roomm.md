## Cost to Carpet a 17x20 Room: A Detailed Price Guide

Considering new carpet for your 17x20 room? It changes how your space looks and feels. Understanding the full cost for a room this size helps you plan. My goal is to show you all the costs involved. This guide breaks down carpet materials, padding, and installation. We will also look at other factors affecting your budget.

### Takeaway

Carpeting a 17x20 room involves several costs. Here are the key points to remember:

*   **Area Calculation:** A 17x20 room needs about 38-45 square yards of carpet, accounting for waste.
*   **Material Costs:** Carpet prices range from $2-$10 per square foot, depending on type and quality.
*   **Padding Costs:** Expect to pay $0.50-$2 per square foot for carpet padding.
*   **Installation Fees:** Professional installation averages $1-$2 per square foot.
*   **Total Budget:** Plan for $1,500-$5,000 or more, based on your choices.

Carpeting a 17x20 room typically costs between $1,500 and $5,000. This range depends on carpet type, padding quality, and installation labor. Budget around $4-$15 per square foot for the complete project. This includes materials and professional installation for your specific room size.

### Understanding Your 17x20 Room Carpet Needs

You are ready to carpet a 17x20 room. The first step is to know the exact area. This helps you buy enough material. A 17x20 room is 340 square feet. Carpet is often sold by the square yard.

To convert square feet to square yards, divide by nine. So, 340 square feet equals approximately 37.78 square yards. You must add extra for cuts and waste. Most professionals suggest adding 10-15% for waste. This brings the total carpet needed to about 42 to 44 square yards. Knowing this number is basic for budgeting.

Picking the right carpet is more than just color. It involves understanding different carpet types. Each type has its own feel and price. For example, plush carpet feels soft. Berber carpet is durable and good for high-traffic areas. This choice affects the final price of carpeting your 17x20 room.

Consider how your room is used. A family room needs a durable carpet. A bedroom might prefer a softer, thicker option. Your lifestyle also plays a role in carpet selection. Choosing wisely now saves money later on.

### Breaking Down Carpet Material Costs for a 17x20 Room

The carpet material itself makes up a large part of your total cost. Prices vary greatly. They depend on the fiber, style, and brand. I have seen basic carpet start around $2 per square foot. High-end, luxury options can reach $10 or more per square foot. This means the material cost for your 17x20 room can be $680 to over $3,400.

Nylon carpet is a common choice. It resists wear and stains well. Polyester carpet is softer and more budget-friendly. Wool carpet is a premium option. It offers natural durability and a luxurious feel. Each fiber type has its own benefits and drawbacks. Your choice impacts longevity and appearance.

Here is a general breakdown of carpet material costs per square foot:

*   **Basic Polyester/Olefin:** $2 - $4
*   **Mid-Range Nylon:** $4 - $7
*   **High-End Nylon/Wool Blends:** $7 - $10
*   **Luxury Wool:** $10+

These prices are for the carpet alone. They do not include padding or installation. Remember to buy enough carpet to cover the 340 square feet, plus the extra for waste. This means buying about 42-45 square yards. Calculating this ensures you have enough material for the entire 17x20 room.

It is helpful to get several quotes. Different stores may offer different prices for similar quality carpets. Always ask about sales or discounts. This can lower the overall material cost for your project. A smart shopper finds good value without sacrificing quality. Understanding [how much to put in carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-to-put-in-carpet) helps you budget for the material itself.

### The Essential Role of Carpet Padding and Its Cost

Carpet padding is an often-overlooked but crucial component. It lies between your subfloor and the new carpet. Padding provides comfort underfoot. It also extends the life of your carpet. Good padding prevents carpet fibers from crushing. This makes your carpet last longer.

Padding prices range from $0.50 to $2 per square foot. For a 17x20 room (340 square feet), this adds $170 to $680 to your budget. The type and thickness of padding affect its price. Thicker padding often costs more but offers better cushioning and sound absorption. It also gives the carpet a softer feel.

Common padding types include:

*   **Rebond Padding:** This is the most popular type. It is made from recycled foam scraps. Rebond offers good density and durability for most homes.
*   **Urethane Foam Padding:** This type provides a softer, more luxurious feel. It is often chosen for bedrooms or low-traffic areas.
*   **Rubber Padding:** Rubber is very dense and resilient. It works well in high-traffic areas and for sound dampening.
*   **Moisture Barrier Padding:** Some padding includes a moisture barrier. This protects your subfloor from spills. It is a good choice for basements or homes with pets.

Choosing the right padding protects your investment. It also improves comfort. Do not cut corners on padding to save money. A cheap pad wears out faster. This can lead to your carpet looking worn prematurely. Always consider [what do you put under a carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-do-you-put-under-a-carpet) before making a final decision. You want a durable and comfortable base for your new floor.

### Professional Carpet Installation Costs Explained

Once you pick your carpet and padding, you need to consider installation. Professional installation ensures a smooth, lasting finish. Most installers charge by the square foot. Prices generally range from $1 to $2 per square foot. For a 17x20 room, installation could cost $340 to $680. This usually covers laying the carpet and padding.

Installation costs can include other services. These might be:

*   **Old Carpet Removal:** Removing your existing carpet and padding costs extra. Expect to pay $0.25 to $0.75 per square foot for this.
*   **Furniture Moving:** If installers move furniture, they charge a fee. This can be $0.10 to $0.50 per square foot. Or, they might charge a flat fee per room.
*   **Subfloor Preparation:** The subfloor must be clean, dry, and level. Any repairs needed will add to the cost. This can involve patching or leveling the floor.
*   **Stair Installation:** Carpeting stairs is more complex. It costs more per step than flat floor installation. This does not apply to a single 17x20 room, but it is worth noting for other projects.
*   **Tack Strip and Seaming:** These are often included in the installation price. Tack strips hold the carpet edges. Seaming is needed if your room is wider than the carpet roll.

Always get a detailed quote. This ensures you know all charges upfront. A good installer provides a warranty on their work. This gives you peace of mind. Professional installation makes your carpet look its best and last longer. Knowing [how to put carpet together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-carpet-together) is their expertise. It is a key part of the total project cost.

### DIY Carpeting a 17x20 Room: Savings and Challenges

You might consider installing carpet yourself to save money. A DIY approach removes labor costs. For a 17x20 room, this means saving $340-$680 on installation. However, carpeting a large room is not easy. It requires specific tools and skills. You must be prepared for the work involved.

Tools you need include:

*   **Carpet Kicker:** This tool helps stretch the carpet onto the tack strips.
*   **Carpet Seamer:** Used to join carpet pieces seamlessly.
*   **Utility Knife:** For precise cuts around edges and obstacles.
*   **Knee Kicker:** To secure the carpet to the tack strips around the room's perimeter.
*   **Stapler:** For securing padding to the subfloor.
*   **Measuring Tape:** Accurate measurements are essential.

The biggest challenge is getting the carpet stretched tight. Loose carpet wrinkles and wears out fast. Seaming carpet pieces also requires practice. An improper seam stands out and can fray. You need patience and a careful approach. I have seen DIY jobs that look great, but I have also seen many that fall short.

Consider the time commitment. Installing carpet in a 17x20 room can take a full weekend or more for an amateur. A professional installer finishes much faster. If you make mistakes, fixing them can add costs. You might need to buy more carpet or padding. These extra purchases can quickly reduce your savings.

For a first-timer, DIY carpet installation can be frustrating. Weigh the potential savings against the effort and risk. Sometimes paying for expert help is worth it. It ensures a high-quality result and saves you stress. If you decide to remove old carpet yourself to save money, learn [how to take up carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-take-up-carpet) correctly. This prevents damage to your subfloor.

### Hidden Costs and Factors Affecting Your Carpet Budget

When budgeting for your 17x20 room carpet, look beyond the basics. Several hidden costs can increase your final bill. Planning for these helps avoid surprises. Being aware of these factors makes your budget more accurate. I always advise my clients to add a buffer for unforeseen expenses.

Here are some common hidden costs and factors:

*   **Subfloor Condition:** The subfloor must be smooth and level. If it needs repairs, patching, or leveling, expect extra charges. This can cost $0.50 to $2 per square foot. It is critical for a good carpet installation.
*   **Furniture Moving:** As mentioned, moving furniture by installers adds to the cost. If you move it yourself, you save money. Plan this step before the installation day.
*   **Old Carpet and Padding Removal:** Disposing of old materials costs money. Some installers include this; others charge extra. Make sure to ask.
*   **Door Trimming:** New, thicker carpet and padding might prevent doors from opening. Installers may need to trim the bottom of doors. This is an additional service charge.
*   **Special Carpet Features:** Stain protection treatments or unique carpet patterns can increase material costs. Custom cuts or intricate designs also cost more in labor.
*   **Minimum Fees:** Some installers have a minimum project fee. This ensures their trip is worthwhile. For a 17x20 room, you likely exceed minimums. However, it is always worth checking.

The specific layout of your 17x20 room also matters. If it has many angles or obstacles, installation takes more time. This can increase labor costs. Always get a written quote that details all services. This clarifies what is included in the price. Understanding these details helps you create a comprehensive budget. It prevents unexpected expenses during your carpet project.

### Choosing the Right Carpet Type for Your 17x20 Space

Selecting the perfect carpet for your 17x20 room involves many considerations. It is not just about price. The right carpet enhances comfort and style. It also withstands daily wear. Thinking about your family's needs is important. Each carpet type offers unique benefits.

*   **Durability:**
    *   **Nylon:** Very durable and resilient. It springs back well and resists crushing. Nylon is excellent for high-traffic areas like family rooms or hallways. It also holds color well.
    *   **Polyester (PET):** Offers good stain resistance and a soft feel. It is less resilient than nylon. Polyester works best in moderate-traffic areas, such as bedrooms.
    *   **Olefin (Polypropylene):** Naturally stain and moisture resistant. It is often used for loop carpets like Berber. Olefin is good for basements or outdoor areas. It can crush more easily than nylon.
    *   **Wool:** A natural fiber that is very durable and luxurious. It resists dirt and stains naturally. Wool is a premium choice for living rooms or formal spaces.

*   **Style and Appearance:**
    *   **Cut Pile:** This category includes plush, Saxony, and frieze carpets. They offer a soft, luxurious feel. Plush shows footprints easily. Frieze carpet (twisted fibers) hides vacuum marks well.
    *   **Loop Pile:** Berber and level loop carpets have uncut loops. They are very durable and resist crushing. These are great for high-traffic areas.
    *   **Cut and Loop Pile:** This combines cut and looped fibers. It creates textured patterns. This carpet hides dirt and wear effectively.

*   **Maintenance:**
    *   Consider how easy the carpet is to clean. Some fibers have built-in stain resistance. Darker colors hide dirt better. Lighter colors make the room feel larger.
    *   Regular vacuuming is key for all carpet types. Some carpets need professional cleaning more often. Learn [how often to clean carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-to-clean-carpet) to extend its life. Knowing [how do you keep your carpet clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-you-keep-your-carpet-clean) can also influence your choice of material.

When choosing, balance your budget with your needs. A cheaper carpet might wear out faster. A more expensive, durable option saves money in the long run. Think about foot traffic, pets, and children. Your selection will greatly impact the final feel and function of your 17x20 room.

### Getting Accurate Quotes for Your Carpeting Project

Getting accurate quotes is essential for managing your budget. Do not settle for just one estimate. I always suggest getting at least three detailed quotes. This allows you to compare prices and services. It helps you find the best value for carpeting your 17x20 room.

Here are steps to get precise quotes:

1.  **Measure Your Room Accurately:** Have your 17x20 room dimensions ready. Also, note any odd angles or permanent fixtures. This helps installers estimate materials better.
2.  **Specify Carpet and Padding Types:** Be clear about the exact carpet fiber and style you want. Also, specify the type and thickness of padding. This ensures all quotes compare the same materials.
3.  **List All Services Needed:** Clearly state if you need old carpet removal, furniture moving, or subfloor prep. Ask if these are included in the quote or are extra.
4.  **Ask for a Written, Detailed Estimate:** A written quote prevents misunderstandings. It should break down costs for materials, padding, labor, and any extra services. Ensure it includes tax.
5.  **Inquire About Warranties:** Ask about warranties on both the carpet material and the installation work. A good warranty offers protection for your investment.
6.  **Check References and Reviews:** Look for installers with good reputations. Online reviews and local recommendations are helpful. This helps ensure quality work.

Some companies offer "all-inclusive" pricing. This might seem simple. However, always ask for a breakdown. Hidden fees can still exist. A transparent quote protects you. It helps you confidently answer the question of [how much this carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-this-carpet) will truly cost. This careful approach ensures you get a fair price for your 17x20 room carpeting project.
