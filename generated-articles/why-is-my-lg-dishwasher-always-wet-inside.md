## LG Dishwasher Always Wet Inside? Here's Why!

There is nothing quite like opening your dishwasher after a cycle, expecting to find perfectly dry dishes, only to be greeted by a damp interior and water droplets on your plates. It is frustrating, and if you own an LG dishwasher, you might wonder, "Why is my LG dishwasher always wet inside?" This common issue affects many users. You are not alone in this experience.

Understanding why your LG dishwasher stays wet is the first step. Many factors can contribute to this problem, ranging from simple user errors to mechanical failures. We will explore common culprits like inadequate drying methods, incorrect loading, and issues with rinse aid. We also discuss potential problems with your heating element or ventilation system. This guide gives you actionable steps to troubleshoot and fix a persistently wet LG dishwasher, helping you achieve sparkling, dry dishes with every wash. Let's get your dishwasher performing at its best.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Rinse Aid Levels:** Low rinse aid is a primary cause of wet dishes.
*   **Load Dishes Correctly:** Improper loading blocks water and heat, preventing proper drying.
*   **Select Proper Drying Options:** Use cycles with heated dry or extra dry options.
*   **Clean Filters Regularly:** Clogged filters hinder performance and airflow.
*   **Inspect Heating Element/Vent Fan:** These components are vital for effective drying.

Is your LG dishwasher always wet inside? This often happens due to a lack of rinse aid, improper dish loading, or selecting a wash cycle without a heated dry option. It can also point to issues with the heating element, vent fan, or clogged filters, all of which prevent effective moisture removal.

## Understanding LG Dishwasher Drying Methods

LG dishwashers use different methods to dry dishes. Older models use a heating element at the bottom of the tub. This element heats the air inside, evaporating water from dishes. Some LG models use a hybrid drying system. This system combines residual heat with a fan or vent. The fan pulls moist air out of the dishwasher. This helps air circulate and aids drying.

Newer, energy-efficient LG dishwashers often rely on condensation drying. These models do not use a heating element. Instead, they heat the water to a high temperature during the final rinse. The hot dishes then transfer heat to the cooler stainless steel tub. This creates condensation on the cooler surfaces, which then drains away. Plastics do not retain heat as well as ceramics or glass. This is why plastic items often remain wet in condensation drying dishwashers. Knowing your dishwasher's drying method helps you troubleshoot. It helps you understand what to expect from its performance.

Understanding your dishwasher's specific drying technology is important. It guides your expectations for dryness. If your model uses condensation drying, some moisture is normal, especially on plastics. If it uses a heating element, you should expect drier dishes. Checking your user manual confirms the drying type your LG dishwasher uses. This information helps you decide if there is a real problem.

## The Importance of Rinse Aid for Dry Dishes

Rinse aid is crucial for getting dry dishes. Many people overlook its importance. Rinse aid reduces the surface tension of water. This allows water to sheet off dishes rather than form droplets. When water forms droplets, they evaporate slowly and leave spots. When water sheets off, it dries faster and leaves fewer spots.

Without enough rinse aid, water clings to surfaces. This results in a wet interior and wet dishes. LG dishwashers are designed to work best with rinse aid. The rinse aid dispenser holds a small amount of this liquid. The dishwasher releases it during the final rinse cycle. This ensures dishes dry quickly and without streaks. You need to refill the rinse aid dispenser regularly. Check the indicator light or window on your dishwasher. It tells you when the rinse aid level is low.

Using a good quality rinse aid makes a big difference. It prevents water spots and streaks. It also helps speed up the drying process. If your LG dishwasher is always wet inside, checking the rinse aid level is the first step. This simple step often solves the problem. A full rinse aid dispenser improves drying significantly. It helps get your dishes sparkling clean and dry.

## Proper Loading Techniques for Optimal Drying

How you load your dishwasher greatly affects drying performance. Many people load dishes improperly. This can block spray arms and prevent hot air from reaching all surfaces. When dishes are too close together, water gets trapped between them. This trapped water cannot evaporate properly. This leaves dishes wet, even after the drying cycle.

Place larger items, like plates and platters, along the sides and back. Angle them downwards for better drainage. Cups, bowls, and glasses go on the top rack. Turn them upside down to prevent water from pooling inside. Avoid nesting items like spoons and forks together. Separate them in the utensil basket. This allows water to clean and dry all surfaces. Do not overcrowd the dishwasher. Overfilling traps moisture and heat. This hinders the drying process. Leave space between items for proper water circulation and air flow.

If your LG dishwasher stays wet inside, try adjusting your loading habits. Experiment with different arrangements. Make sure nothing blocks the spray arms. Proper loading promotes efficient washing and drying. It helps hot air circulate freely. This helps moisture escape the dishwasher. This simple change can significantly improve drying results.

## Selecting the Right Dishwasher Cycle and Options

The wash cycle and drying options you choose impact how dry your dishes become. Many LG dishwashers have various cycles. Some cycles are better for drying than others. Standard or Auto cycles often include a heated dry phase. Quick Wash cycles may not. A quick wash cycle usually finishes faster. It might skip the heated drying entirely. This can leave your dishes wet.

Look for cycles like "Heavy," "Sanitize," or "Extra Dry" on your LG dishwasher. These cycles use higher water temperatures or longer drying times. Higher temperatures help evaporate water more effectively. The "Sanitize" option uses extremely hot water. This not only sanitizes but also significantly aids drying through condensation. Some LG models have a "Night Dry" or "Extra Dry" option. These options extend the drying phase. They also engage the fan more often. This ensures maximum dryness. If you often find your LG dishwasher always wet inside, review the cycle you use. You might need a cycle with more drying power.

If you are concerned about energy use, balance it with desired dryness. Sometimes, a slightly longer cycle with better drying is worth it. Always check your dishwasher's manual for specific cycle details. Understanding your appliance’s features helps you use it effectively. Choosing the right cycle makes a big difference in achieving dry dishes.

## Troubleshooting Common Component Failures

If your LG dishwasher is always wet inside, despite correct loading and rinse aid use, a component might be failing. Two key parts are the heating element and the vent fan. A problem with either can affect drying.

### Heating Element Issues

The heating element sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It looks like a metal coil. This element heats the water during wash cycles. It also heats the air during the heated dry cycle. If the heating element fails, it cannot heat the air for drying. This leaves dishes wet. You can test the heating element for continuity with a multimeter. Before testing, turn off power to the dishwasher. A non-working element needs replacement. This task often requires professional help.

### Vent Fan Problems

Some LG dishwashers use a vent fan. This fan pulls moist air from the tub. It pushes the air out through a vent. If the vent fan motor is faulty, it will not operate. This leaves humid air trapped inside the dishwasher. The dishes remain wet. You might hear unusual noises from the fan, or no noise at all. A broken vent fan usually needs replacement. This is a common issue that causes a wet dishwasher interior. Issues like this are similar to problems faced with other brands, like when a [Whirlpool dishwasher stays wet inside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-stays-wet-inside).

### Door Seal Leaks

A faulty door seal can also contribute to a wet interior. If the door seal is cracked or worn, moist air can escape. This prevents proper air circulation inside the dishwasher. It also means the heat intended for drying escapes. The seal might also allow small amounts of water to leak, contributing to overall dampness. Inspect the gasket around the door. Look for cracks, tears, or signs of wear. A damaged gasket needs replacement to seal the dishwasher properly. This helps maintain internal temperature and humidity for effective drying.

These component failures require careful inspection. Sometimes, they need professional repair. If you are unsure, contact an appliance technician. Addressing these issues can resolve the problem of your LG dishwasher always being wet inside.

## Maintaining Your LG Dishwasher for Better Drying

Regular maintenance keeps your LG dishwasher running efficiently. This includes ensuring proper drying. Neglecting maintenance can lead to moisture problems. A clean dishwasher performs better. It dries dishes more effectively.

### Cleaning the Dishwasher Filter

LG dishwashers have filters that collect food particles. These filters are often located at the bottom of the tub. If the filters get clogged, water cannot drain properly. This leaves standing water or excessive moisture inside. A clogged filter also affects water circulation. This hinders proper washing and drying. You should clean the dishwasher filter regularly. Most manufacturers recommend cleaning it at least once a month. To clean the filter, twist and remove it. Rinse it under running water to remove debris. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away stubborn food bits. This simple step improves drainage and drying.

### Checking Water Temperature

Water temperature plays a vital role in drying. Hot water evaporates more quickly than cold water. Your LG dishwasher heats water during cycles. However, your home's hot water supply also matters. Ensure your water heater is set to at least 120°F (49°C). If the incoming water is too cold, the dishwasher works harder to heat it. This can impact the final rinse temperature. A hotter final rinse helps dishes dry by condensation. Run your kitchen sink hot water for a minute before starting the dishwasher. This ensures hot water fills the dishwasher immediately.

### Inspecting Spray Arms

The spray arms distribute water throughout the dishwasher. Over time, food particles or mineral deposits can clog the small holes. Clogged spray arms lead to poor washing. They also affect how water drains from dishes. This can leave puddles or excess moisture. Regularly check the spray arms for blockages. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear any clogged holes. Ensure the spray arms spin freely. Proper water distribution is essential for both cleaning and preparing dishes for drying.

Regular cleaning and simple checks extend your dishwasher's life. They also ensure it dries your dishes properly. These steps help prevent your LG dishwasher from being always wet inside. Addressing maintenance issues proactively saves you time and frustration.
