## Understanding Your Silk Oriental Rug: The Foundation of Care

Before you start any cleaning, it is important to understand your rug. Silk rugs are famous for their strength, natural luster, and soft feel. However, these fibers are also delicate and absorb moisture easily. Incorrect cleaning can harm the fibers, causing shrinkage, color bleed, or dullness.

Knowing if your rug is truly silk or a blend is the first step. True silk has a distinct smooth, cool feel when you touch it. It also reflects light differently from various angles, creating a shimmering effect. You can confirm its material with simple tests.
