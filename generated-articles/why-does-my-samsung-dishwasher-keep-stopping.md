### Why does my Samsung dishwasher keep stopping?

Your Samsung dishwasher might keep stopping due to power supply issues, a faulty door latch, problems with water intake or drainage, or a clogged filter. Sensor malfunctions and control board errors can also interrupt cycles. These issues cause the dishwasher to pause or stop as a safety measure.

## Power Supply and Electrical Interruptions

A Samsung dishwasher needs stable power to run a full cycle. If your dishwasher keeps stopping, the first thing to check is its power source. A sudden loss of electricity will halt the machine. This can happen for a few reasons.

Sometimes, the dishwasher simply loses connection. The power cord might be loose at the outlet. Make sure it is pushed in all the way. A tripped circuit breaker is another common cause. Dishwashers use a lot of power. They can overload a circuit, especially when other appliances are running. You should go to your home's electrical panel. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. If it is in the "off" or middle position, flip it completely off, then flip it back on. This resets the power to the unit. If the breaker trips again quickly, there might be a deeper electrical issue. You should not ignore repeated breaker trips.

You might also check the outlet itself. The outlet could be faulty. Test it with another small appliance, like a phone charger or a lamp. If nothing works, the outlet might be dead. In some cases, an internal wiring problem within the dishwasher can cause power issues. This is less common but possible. It requires a professional. Ensure your power supply is consistent for smooth operation.

This article provides deeper insight into specific power concerns.

### Checking the Power Cord and Outlet

My first step when my Samsung dishwasher stops is always to check the plug. I make sure the power cord connects firmly to the wall outlet. Sometimes, it can wiggle loose over time. A loose connection makes the dishwasher lose power intermittently. This causes it to stop mid-cycle.

Next, I look at the wall outlet. I unplug the dishwasher. Then, I plug in a different appliance. A small lamp or a hairdryer works well. If the other appliance does not get power, the outlet is likely the problem. This means the issue is with your homeâ€™s electrical system. It is not with the dishwasher itself. You might need an electrician to fix a dead outlet.

### Resetting the Circuit Breaker

The circuit breaker is a safety device. It prevents electrical overloads. If your Samsung dishwasher draws too much power, the breaker trips. This shuts off power to the dishwasher. I go to my home's main electrical panel. Each breaker is usually labeled. I find the one for the kitchen or dishwasher.

If the breaker is in the "off" position, I push it all the way to "off." Then, I flip it firmly to the "on" position. This resets the power. If the dishwasher still stops, or if the breaker trips again immediately, this points to a larger electrical fault. This could be an issue with the appliance's internal wiring or the circuit itself. Repeated tripping requires professional attention. It suggests a potential safety hazard.

## Water Supply and Drainage Problems

A Samsung dishwasher needs a steady supply of water to clean dishes. It also needs to drain that water away. Problems with either water inflow or outflow can cause the machine to stop. The dishwasher's sensors detect these issues. They will pause or stop the cycle to prevent damage or floods.

First, check the water inlet hose. This hose connects the dishwasher to your home's water supply. It might be kinked or bent, restricting water flow. Straighten any kinks you find. Also, ensure the water shut-off valve is fully open. This valve is usually under the sink, near the dishwasher. If it is partly closed, the dishwasher will not get enough water. This leads to cycle interruptions.

Second, consider drainage. A clogged drain line or an issue with the air gap can prevent water from leaving the dishwasher. If the machine cannot drain, it often stops. Food particles, grease, or detergent buildup can block the drain filter or hose. This causes water to back up. When water backs up, the dishwasher detects an error and halts. You can often clean the filter yourself. We will discuss this more in a later section. Proper water flow is vital for any dishwasher.

### Checking Water Inlet and Supply

My Samsung dishwasher often stops if it cannot get enough water. I always check the water inlet hose first. This hose brings water into the dishwasher. It connects to the hot water line, usually under the sink. I look for any bends or twists in the hose. A kink restricts water flow. Straightening the hose often solves the problem quickly.

Next, I check the water shut-off valve. This valve controls the water supply to the dishwasher. It is usually a small handle or knob. It sits on the water pipe leading to the dishwasher. I make sure it is fully open. If it is only partly open, the dishwasher might fill too slowly. This triggers a sensor and makes the cycle stop. Sometimes, debris can block the inlet screen. This screen is inside the water inlet valve. It catches particles before they enter the dishwasher. If it is clogged, water flow reduces. Cleaning this screen can restore proper water supply.

### Clearing Drain Issues

Proper drainage is critical for a Samsung dishwasher to complete its cycle. If the dishwasher cannot drain, it will stop. My first check is the drain hose. This hose takes dirty water out of the dishwasher. I look for kinks or blockages in the hose. It often connects to the garbage disposal or a drain pipe under the sink. Straightening any bends helps the water flow freely.

Next, I check the air gap. This small cylinder is on your sink countertop. It prevents drain water from backing up into the dishwasher. If it gets clogged, water cannot drain properly. I remove the cap and clean out any debris. Lastly, I examine the drain pump filter. This filter sits inside the dishwasher, usually at the bottom. Food particles and debris collect here. A clogged filter blocks drainage. I remove the filter, clean it thoroughly, and replace it. Clearing these common drain issues helps the dishwasher finish its cycle.

## Clogged Filters and Spray Arms

A common reason for a Samsung dishwasher stopping is a dirty filter or blocked spray arms. Dishwashers are designed to handle food scraps, but over time, these can build up. This buildup prevents the dishwasher from working correctly. It impacts both cleaning performance and cycle completion.

The filter system in your Samsung dishwasher traps food particles. If this filter gets clogged, water cannot drain efficiently. This causes the dishwasher to fill with dirty water or stop mid-cycle. The dishwasher senses the improper water levels. It then halts the operation. Regular cleaning of the filter is essential. You should check it every few washes. Remove any trapped food debris, rinse it under running water, and put it back.

Blocked spray arms also cause issues. The spray arms have small holes that spray water onto the dishes. If these holes are blocked by food particles or mineral deposits, water pressure drops. This means dishes do not get cleaned properly. The dishwasher might sense low pressure or insufficient water distribution. It could then stop the cycle. You should clean the spray arms periodically. Remove them and clear any blockages with a small brush or toothpick. My personal experience shows that a clean filter and clear spray arms solve many stopping problems. Knowing [where the filter is in your Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-filter-in-samsung-dishwasher) makes this easy.

### Locating and Cleaning the Dishwasher Filter

My Samsung dishwasher has a filter system at the bottom. This system catches food particles and prevents them from recirculating. To find it, I pull out the lower dish rack. The filter usually consists of two parts: a cylindrical filter and a flat filter screen. They are often twisted or pulled out.

I remove both parts carefully. They often have directions for removal, like an arrow to twist. Once out, I take them to the sink. I rinse them under warm running water. I use an old toothbrush to gently scrub away any stuck-on food debris or grease. It is amazing how much gunk can build up there. I make sure to clean both sides of the filter screen. When they are spotless, I reinsert them. I twist them back into place until they are secure. This simple task takes only a few minutes. It can prevent many stopping issues.

### Clearing Blockages in Spray Arms

The spray arms are vital for cleaning dishes. They distribute water throughout the dishwasher tub. My Samsung dishwasher has spray arms on the bottom and often in the middle. They have small nozzles that can get clogged. Food particles, mineral deposits from hard water, or even small pieces of plastic can block these holes.

To clean them, I first remove the spray arms. They usually unclip or unscrew from their central mount. Once removed, I hold them under a faucet. I let water run through them to flush out loose debris. For stubborn blockages, I use a small toothpick or a straightened paper clip. I gently poke through each nozzle hole to clear any obstructions. This ensures water sprays out with full force. After cleaning, I reattach them firmly. I spin them by hand to make sure they rotate freely. A blocked spray arm can lead to poor cleaning and cycle interruptions. This is because the dishwasher senses insufficient water pressure or distribution.

## Door Latch and Sensor Issues

A Samsung dishwasher relies on a fully closed and latched door to operate. This is a safety feature. If the door latch is faulty or the door is not shut correctly, the dishwasher will stop. It will not start or will pause mid-cycle. The door latch activates a switch that tells the control board the door is secure.

First, check the door closure itself. Make sure no dishes or racks are blocking the door from closing completely. Sometimes, a detergent dispenser or a dish can stick out. This prevents a tight seal. Push everything back inside the dishwasher. Then, try closing the door firmly until you hear it click. If it does not click, the latch might be loose or broken.

Second, the door latch mechanism itself might be worn out. Over time, the plastic or metal parts can degrade. This prevents the latch from engaging properly. You might need to replace the door latch assembly. This is often a straightforward fix. Third, the door latch switch could be faulty. This switch is inside the latch. It tells the dishwasher's control board that the door is shut. If the switch fails, the dishwasher thinks the door is open, even when it is not. This causes it to stop. These parts ensure user safety during operation.

### Inspecting the Door Latch Mechanism

I always check the door latch when my Samsung dishwasher stops. This is one of the easiest things to check. The door latch has a hook that slides into a catch on the dishwasher frame. I open and close the door a few times. I listen for a clear, audible "click." This click tells me the latch has engaged. If I do not hear it, or if it feels loose, the latch might be the problem.

Sometimes, the latch itself becomes misaligned. I examine both the latch on the door and the strike plate on the dishwasher's body. I look for signs of wear, damage, or looseness. If the latch is broken, it cannot signal to the dishwasher that the door is shut. This prevents the cycle from continuing. In some cases, adjusting the strike plate can help. If it is visibly broken or worn, replacement is the best option. This ensures the dishwasher knows it is safe to run.

### Checking for Sensor Malfunctions

Samsung dishwashers use sensors to monitor various conditions. These sensors detect water levels, temperature, and even turbidity (how dirty the water is). If a sensor malfunctions, it can send incorrect signals to the control board. This might cause the dishwasher to stop prematurely. For instance, a water level sensor might wrongly detect a low water level. The dishwasher then pauses or stops filling.

Another common sensor issue relates to temperature. If the heating element or the temperature sensor fails, the dishwasher may stop. It cannot reach the correct water temperature for cleaning or drying. I check for any error codes on the display. These codes often point to a specific sensor issue. While a faulty sensor usually requires professional replacement, restarting the dishwasher or resetting its power can sometimes clear a temporary sensor glitch. Always consult your user manual for error code meanings. If your Samsung dishwasher suddenly stops turning off, it might be related to a sensor or control issue.

## Control Board and Electronic Issues

The control board is the brain of your Samsung dishwasher. It manages all functions and processes. It receives signals from sensors and sends commands to various components. If the control board malfunctions, it can cause the dishwasher to stop unexpectedly. This is often a more serious problem. It may require a professional repair.

A faulty control board can send incorrect signals. It might tell the dishwasher to stop running, even if there is no actual problem. This can appear as intermittent stopping or a complete failure to respond. Power surges or age can damage control boards. They contain complex electronic components. Sometimes, the issue is not a complete failure of the board. It could be a minor glitch. A simple reset can clear these minor errors. To reset, you might unplug the dishwasher for a few minutes. Then, plug it back in. Some models have a specific reset procedure mentioned in the user manual.

If the reset does not work, and other common issues are ruled out, the control board might need replacement. This is usually an expensive part. It needs expert installation. Error codes on the display often indicate a control board problem. For instance, a persistent error that does not clear after troubleshooting could point to this.

### Resetting the Dishwasher's Electronics

When my Samsung dishwasher acts strangely, I try a simple reset first. This can clear temporary electronic glitches. It is like restarting a computer. Most Samsung dishwashers can be reset in a few ways. The easiest method is to simply unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet. I leave it unplugged for about five to ten minutes. This allows any residual electrical charge to dissipate. After waiting, I plug it back in firmly.

Another way to reset is to flip the circuit breaker. I go to my home's electrical panel. I find the breaker that controls the dishwasher. I flip it to the "off" position. I wait for a few minutes. Then, I flip it back to the "on" position. This achieves the same power cycle. Some Samsung models also have a button combination for a "hard reset." You would need to check your specific model's user manual for this. A successful reset might clear the issue. The dishwasher should then complete its cycle.

### Identifying Error Codes

Samsung dishwashers often display error codes when something goes wrong. These codes are very helpful. They give you a clue about what part is failing. If your dishwasher stops, look at the display panel. Note any numbers or letters that appear. These are error codes. Each code points to a specific issue.

For example, a "LE" code might indicate a leak. A "4C" code often means a water supply problem. I always keep my Samsung dishwasher's user manual handy. The manual contains a list of all error codes. It explains what each code means and suggests troubleshooting steps. If you do not have the physical manual, you can usually find it online on Samsung's support website. Understanding these codes helps you diagnose the problem faster. It also tells you if the problem is something you can fix or if you need a technician. It helps to differentiate if your dishwasher is taking too long or stopping altogether; for long cycle issues, check out [Why Does My Samsung Dishwasher Take So Long](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-samsung-dishwasher-take-so-long).

## Overloading, Detergent, and Loading Habits

How you load your Samsung dishwasher and the type of detergent you use can also cause it to stop. These factors affect water circulation and suds levels. The dishwasher senses these imbalances and may pause or stop the cycle. This prevents improper cleaning or potential damage.

First, consider overloading. Trying to fit too many dishes can block the spray arms. If the spray arms cannot rotate freely, water will not reach all items. This causes an uneven wash. The dishwasher might sense that dishes are not getting wet enough. It might then stop the cycle. Make sure there is enough space between dishes. Do not block the detergent dispenser.

Second, detergent usage is crucial. Using too much detergent, or the wrong type of detergent, creates excessive suds. These suds can overflow the machine or trigger flood sensors. The dishwasher detects the over-sudsing. It then stops to prevent a mess. Always use detergent specifically designed for dishwashers. Use the recommended amount. Liquid dish soap for handwashing creates far too many suds. This will definitely cause problems. Using too little detergent can also leave food residue. This residue then clogs filters. Correct loading and detergent use contribute to smooth operation.

### Proper Dish Loading Techniques

Loading your Samsung dishwasher correctly is key to a complete wash cycle. When I load my dishwasher, I always make sure not to overcrowd it. Overloading blocks the spray arms. If the spray arms cannot spin freely, water will not reach all dishes. This leads to poorly cleaned items. It can also cause the dishwasher to stop because it senses the lack of water distribution.

I place larger items, like plates and serving dishes, along the sides and back. This leaves the center clear. I ensure tall items do not block the detergent dispenser door. If the dispenser cannot open, detergent will not release. Cups and glasses go upside down in the top rack. Bowls should face downwards. I also try to prevent dishes from nesting together. Nesting stops water from reaching their surfaces. Proper spacing allows water and detergent to circulate effectively. This ensures a thorough clean. It also helps the dishwasher finish its cycle without interruptions.

### Using the Right Detergent and Amount

The type and amount of detergent you use are important for your Samsung dishwasher. I always use automatic dishwasher detergent. This type of detergent is low-sudsing. It is formulated specifically for dishwashers. Never use liquid dish soap meant for handwashing dishes. Hand dish soap creates too many suds. These suds can overflow the dishwasher. They can also trigger the anti-flood sensors. This causes the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle.

Using too much dishwasher detergent can also lead to problems. Excessive suds can hinder proper water circulation. It can also leave a film on dishes. I follow the detergent manufacturer's recommendations. Usually, one pre-measured pod or a small amount of powder is enough. If you have soft water, you might need even less. If you have hard water, you might need a bit more or a rinse aid. The correct detergent and amount prevent over-sudsing. This helps your dishwasher run smoothly.

## Heating Element and Drying Issues

A Samsung dishwasher heats water for washing and for the drying cycle. If the heating element malfunctions, it can cause the dishwasher to stop. The dishwasher might pause if it cannot reach the correct water temperature. This happens during the main wash or rinse cycles. It also happens if it cannot achieve the required temperature for drying. Some dishwashers may stop completely if a heating fault is detected to prevent damage or safety risks.

The heating element is a metal coil at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It warms the water during the wash cycle. It also helps dry the dishes at the end. If this element fails, dishes may come out dirty or wet. The dishwasher might also display an error code. This code indicates a heating problem. A faulty heating element typically requires replacement. This is usually a job for a qualified technician.

Sometimes, the issue is not the element itself. It could be the thermostat or temperature sensor. These parts regulate the heating process. If they fail, they might prevent the element from turning on or off correctly. This causes the dishwasher to stop. These components ensure the water reaches the right temperature for effective cleaning and sanitation. A dishwasher that keeps stopping because it cannot heat effectively points to these parts. For more information on heating, you can check: [Does My Samsung Dishwasher Heat Its Own Water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-my-samsung-dishwasher-heat-its-own-water).

### Troubleshooting the Heating Element

When my Samsung dishwasher stops and the dishes are not hot, I suspect the heating element. This element is found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It looks like a metal coil. I first visually inspect it for any signs of damage. I look for breaks, cracks, or corrosion. Sometimes, the element may look fine but still be faulty.

A multimeter is the best tool to test a heating element. This tool measures electrical resistance. I disconnect the power to the dishwasher first. Safety is always important. Then, I access the element's terminals. I touch the multimeter probes to these terminals. A good heating element will show a certain resistance reading, usually around 10 to 30 ohms. If the multimeter reads "open" or infinite resistance, the element is broken. It needs replacement. This test confirms if the element is faulty. If it is, professional replacement is often needed.

### Issues with Thermostat and Temperature Sensor

The thermostat and temperature sensor work with the heating element. They ensure the water reaches the correct temperature. If your Samsung dishwasher stops mid-cycle and gives a heating error, these parts could be the cause. The thermostat monitors the water temperature directly. It tells the control board when the water is hot enough. If it malfunctions, it might incorrectly signal that the water is too cold or too hot. This can cause the dishwasher to stop.

The temperature sensor also provides readings to the control board. If this sensor sends incorrect data, the heating cycle will not function properly. The dishwasher might never reach its target temperature. It could then pause or stop. These parts are typically not user-serviceable. They require diagnosis with a multimeter. Replacing them usually needs a professional. They are often part of a larger assembly. Faults in these components lead to inefficient cleaning and cycle interruptions.

## Motor and Pump Problems

The motor and pump are the heart of your Samsung dishwasher. The motor powers the pump, which circulates water through the spray arms. It also helps drain the water. If there is a problem with either the motor or the pump, the dishwasher will likely stop. It cannot properly wash or drain.

A common issue is a clogged pump. Hard objects like broken glass, fruit pits, or even a small bone can get past the filter. They then jam the pump impeller. If the impeller cannot spin, the pump cannot move water. The motor might hum but not actually pump. This causes the dishwasher to stop. It prevents damage to the motor. You might hear a grinding noise.

Another problem can be a failing pump motor. Over time, motors can wear out. Bearings can fail, or electrical windings can burn out. If the motor is struggling, it may overheat and shut down. This causes intermittent stopping. You might notice unusual noises, like humming or grinding, before the complete stop. Replacing a motor or pump is a complex repair. It often requires dismantling the lower part of the dishwasher. This is a job for an experienced technician.

### Troubleshooting the Circulation Pump

The circulation pump pushes water through the spray arms during the wash cycle. If this pump has issues, your Samsung dishwasher will stop. I listen for unusual noises when the dishwasher runs. A loud humming or grinding sound might indicate a problem. This often suggests the pump motor is struggling or blocked.

First, I disconnect the power to the dishwasher. I then check for foreign objects inside the pump housing. Sometimes, a piece of glass or a small bone can get past the filter. This jams the pump impeller. Clearing such an obstruction can fix the problem. This often requires removing the lower spray arm and potentially the pump cover. If no obvious blockage is present, the pump motor itself might be failing. It might be overheating. This causes it to stop. A failing motor often requires replacement. This is a more involved repair. It may be best for a service professional to handle it.

### Checking the Drain Pump

The drain pump removes dirty water from the dishwasher. If your Samsung dishwasher stops with water still in the tub, the drain pump might be the culprit. I first ensure the drain hose is clear. Then, I check the drain pump itself. It is usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher, near the filter.

I listen for noises when the dishwasher tries to drain. A humming sound without water movement suggests the pump is trying but blocked. This indicates an obstruction. I carefully remove the filter and look into the drain area. I check for any debris like food particles, broken glass, or small objects. These can jam the impeller. If I find any, I remove them. If the pump makes no sound, it might have an electrical problem. It might have completely failed. If the
