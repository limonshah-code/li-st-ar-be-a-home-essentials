### Why Your LG Dryer Is Not Getting Hot: A Concise Answer

Your LG dryer is not getting hot often due to clogged vents, a faulty heating element, a blown thermal fuse, or a defective thermostat. Other reasons include power supply issues, problems with the igniter or gas valve in gas dryers, or a damaged thermistor. Proper diagnosis helps identify the specific part needing attention.

## Check Basic Power and Settings for Your LG Dryer

When your LG dryer stops heating, it is smart to start with the simplest checks. Sometimes, the problem is not a broken part. It might be something very basic, like power or settings. I always recommend checking these things first. This approach saves time and avoids unnecessary part purchases.

### Power Supply Issues

Your LG dryer needs a strong power connection to produce heat. Electric dryers require a 240-volt circuit. If only half of the breaker trips, the dryer drum might still spin, but it will not heat. Check your home's circuit breaker panel. Look for any tripped breakers. These usually sit in an "off" or middle position. Reset them by flipping them completely off, then back on.

Gas dryers need both 120-volt electricity and a gas supply. The electricity powers the drum, lights, and controls. The gas supplies the heat. Ensure the gas shut-off valve behind the dryer is open. You should also check the power cord for damage. A loose or damaged cord prevents full power delivery. Make sure the dryer plug sits firmly in the wall outlet. If your dryer is electric and still not heating, you might find more specific troubleshooting tips by exploring why an [electric dryer is not getting hot enough](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-electric-dryer-not-getting-hot-enough).

### Incorrect Cycle Settings

LG dryers have many settings and cycles. Some cycles do not use heat. For example, the "Air Dry" or "Wrinkle Care" cycles tumble clothes without heat. If you select one of these cycles, your dryer will not produce warmth. Always check the selected cycle. Ensure you picked a heated drying option.

Also, look at the "EcoDry" or "Energy Saver" options. These settings use lower heat or extend drying times to save energy. They might make you think the dryer is not heating properly. If your clothes still come out damp, try a normal or high-heat setting. This helps confirm if the dryer actually has a heating issue or if it is just a setting. Sometimes, simple adjustments fix the problem.

## Address Airflow Issues in Your LG Dryer

Airflow is very important for your LG dryer to heat effectively. A dryer works by circulating hot air through your clothes and then expelling moist air. If this airflow becomes restricted, the dryer cannot heat properly. It also poses a fire hazard. I always tell people to prioritize airflow checks.

### Clogged Lint Filter

The lint filter traps lint from your clothes. This filter sits inside the dryer door or at the front. A clogged lint filter greatly reduces airflow. When air cannot move freely, the heating element (or gas burner) overheats and then shuts off. The dryer might run, but it will not produce heat. It is vital to clean your lint filter after every load. This simple habit prevents many heating problems.

To clean it, pull out the screen and remove the lint. Sometimes, a film builds up on the screen from dryer sheets. This film can also block airflow. If you notice this, wash the lint screen with warm, soapy water. Use a soft brush to scrub it clean. Rinse it thoroughly and let it dry completely before putting it back. Regular filter cleaning is a key part of how to effectively [clean your LG dryer filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-on-lg-dryer).

### Blocked Dryer Vent

Beyond the lint filter, the main dryer vent system can also get blocked. This system includes the vent duct directly behind the dryer, the vent hose, and the exhaust vent outside your home. Lint builds up in these areas over time. A heavily blocked vent severely restricts airflow. This causes the dryer to overheat and shut off the heat.

Symptoms of a blocked vent include clothes taking too long to dry, a burning smell, or the dryer feeling very hot to the touch. Cleaning the entire dryer vent system is a critical maintenance task. You can use a vent brush kit or a vacuum cleaner with a long hose attachment. I suggest cleaning the vent system at least once a year, more often if you use the dryer frequently or have pets. Learning how to properly [clean an LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer) involves maintaining this entire system.

### Kinked or Damaged Vent Hose

The vent hose connects your dryer to the main exhaust duct. This hose often sits behind the dryer, making it vulnerable to kinks or damage. If the hose bends sharply or gets crushed against a wall, airflow restricts. A damaged hose with holes or tears also reduces efficiency. It allows moist air to escape into your laundry room instead of outside.

Pull your dryer away from the wall. Inspect the entire length of the vent hose. Ensure it runs straight with minimal bends. If you find kinks, straighten them out. If the hose is crushed or torn, you will need to replace it. Use rigid or semi-rigid metal ducting if possible, as it resists kinks better and is less prone to lint buildup than flexible foil or plastic hoses. Good airflow is essential for any dryer, including if you're wondering why an [electric dryer isn't getting hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-isnt-my-electric-dryer-getting-hot) or any other type.

## Examine Electric Dryer Heating Components

Electric dryers rely on several key components to produce and regulate heat. If your LG dryer is electric and not heating, one of these parts is likely at fault. Diagnosing these requires some electrical knowledge and care. Always unplug the dryer before beginning any inspection or repair.

### Faulty Heating Element

The heating element is the primary source of heat in an electric dryer. It is a coil of wire that glows red when electricity passes through it. Over time, this element can break or burn out. A break in the coil prevents electricity from flowing, so no heat generates. You can usually find the heating element at the back of the dryer, inside the heating duct.

To check it, you need a multimeter. With the dryer unplugged, disconnect the wires from the heating element. Set your multimeter to measure ohms (Î©). Touch the multimeter probes to the terminals of the heating element. A good heating element will show a resistance reading, typically between 8 and 12 ohms. If the reading is infinite (open circuit) or zero, the element is bad and needs replacement. This is a very common reason an LG dryer is not getting hot.

### Tripped Thermal Fuse

The thermal fuse is a safety device. It is a small, non-resettable fuse that blows when the dryer overheats. This protects the dryer from fire hazards caused by blockages in the ventilation system or other issues. Once the thermal fuse blows, it cuts power to the heating element (and sometimes the motor), preventing the dryer from producing heat. It is a one-time fuse; once tripped, you must replace it.

The thermal fuse is usually located near the blower housing or the heating element. It appears as a small white cylinder with two wires. To test it, use a multimeter set to continuity mode. Place the probes on each terminal of the fuse. A working fuse will show continuity (a beep or a reading close to zero ohms). If there is no continuity, the fuse is blown. When replacing a thermal fuse, always check for the cause of the overheating, such as a clogged vent, otherwise, the new fuse will blow again.

### Malfunctioning Thermostats

Dryers use several thermostats to control and monitor temperature. These components cycle the heating element on and off to maintain the desired temperature. If a thermostat fails, it can either prevent the dryer from heating or cause it to overheat. There are typically two main types of thermostats in a dryer: the cycling thermostat and the high-limit thermostat.

### Defective Cycling Thermostat

The cycling thermostat turns the heating element on and off to maintain the selected drying temperature. If this thermostat fails, it might not signal the heating element to turn on, resulting in no heat. It is often located near the blower housing or heating element. You can test it with a multimeter for continuity at room temperature. A good cycling thermostat should show continuity. If it does not, it needs replacement.

### Bad High-Limit Thermostat

The high-limit thermostat is another safety device. It measures the air temperature inside the heating chamber. If the temperature exceeds a safe limit (usually due to restricted airflow), this thermostat opens the circuit, cutting power to the heating element. Unlike the thermal fuse, some high-limit thermostats are resettable, but many are not.

This thermostat is usually located very close to the heating element. To test it, use a multimeter on the continuity setting. A good high-limit thermostat should show continuity at room temperature. If it does not, it is defective and needs replacement. If this part fails, it might also cause issues similar to when an [LG dryer gets too hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dryer-getting-too-hot), as it directly controls temperature regulation.

### Worn Out Thermistor

Some LG dryers use a thermistor instead of a cycling thermostat. A thermistor is a sensor that changes its electrical resistance based on temperature. The control board uses this resistance reading to determine the dryer's internal temperature and control the heating element. If the thermistor is faulty, it sends incorrect temperature readings to the control board. This can cause the dryer not to heat at all or to heat improperly.

The thermistor is usually located on the blower housing or near the heating element. To test it, you need to measure its resistance with a multimeter. The expected resistance value varies by model and temperature. You should consult your dryer's service manual for the correct specifications. If the readings are way off, the thermistor is likely bad. It needs replacement to ensure accurate temperature sensing and proper heating.

## Troubleshoot Gas Dryer Heating Components

Gas dryers use natural gas or propane to produce heat. They have different heating components compared to electric dryers. If your LG gas dryer is not getting hot, the issue likely lies within its ignition or gas supply system. Always ensure the gas supply valve is open before troubleshooting. Safety is paramount when working with gas appliances. Unplug the dryer before checking components.

### Igniter Problems

A gas dryer's igniter is a small, silicon carbide or nitride rod that heats up to ignite the gas. When you start a cycle, the igniter glows orange or red, indicating it is trying to heat. If the igniter is cracked or simply fails to glow, the gas will not ignite, and your dryer will not produce heat. You can often see the igniter through a small observation port near the burner assembly.

To check the igniter, you first need to confirm it receives power. If it does not glow, carefully remove the front panel or access panel to reach the burner assembly. Visually inspect the igniter for cracks or breaks. You can also test it for continuity using a multimeter. A good igniter will show resistance (usually between 50-400 ohms). No continuity means it is broken. This is a very common failure point in gas dryers.

### Faulty Flame Sensor

The flame sensor works alongside the igniter. Its job is to detect if the gas has ignited. Once the igniter heats the gas and a flame appears, the flame sensor sends a signal to the gas valve. This signal tells the gas valve to stay open, allowing gas to flow and maintain the flame. If the flame sensor is dirty or faulty, it might not detect the flame. It then tells the gas valve to close, shutting off the gas supply and heat.

This part is usually located near the igniter and burner tube. It looks like a small, metallic rod. To test the flame sensor, use a multimeter to check for continuity. A good flame sensor should show continuity when cool. If it does not, it is defective and needs replacement. Sometimes, a dirty flame sensor just needs cleaning, but often replacement is the best fix for inconsistent heat.

### Malfunctioning Gas Valve Solenoids

The gas valve solenoids control the flow of gas to the burner. There are usually two or three solenoids attached to the gas valve assembly. When the igniter glows and the flame sensor detects no flame, the control board signals these solenoids to open. This allows gas to flow to the burner for ignition. If one or more of these solenoids fail, they will not open the gas valve, preventing gas from reaching the burner, even if the igniter is working.

You can test each solenoid for continuity using a multimeter. Disconnect the wires from each solenoid. Measure the resistance across the terminals of each solenoid coil. The specific resistance values vary by model, so consult your dryer's service manual. If any solenoid shows an open circuit or incorrect resistance, it is faulty. You typically replace all the solenoids as a set since they often wear out at similar rates. This ensures reliable gas flow and proper heating.

## Inspect Other LG Dryer Parts

While heating and airflow components are common culprits, other parts can also prevent your LG dryer from getting hot. These issues are less frequent but still worth checking if basic troubleshooting does not solve the problem. These components affect the overall operation, including heat generation.

### Broken Motor

The motor in your dryer powers both the drum and the blower fan. The blower fan is essential for moving air through the dryer and out the vent. If the motor is broken or weak, it might still turn the drum, but it may not spin the blower fan fast enough. Insufficient airflow through the blower fan leads to overheating of the heating element or gas burner. This overheating causes safety thermostats or fuses to trip, cutting off the heat.

You might notice the dryer takes much longer to dry, or it feels very hot to the touch on the outside. Listen for unusual noises coming from the motor, such as humming or grinding. If the motor is failing, it will eventually stop working entirely. Replacing a dryer motor can be complex and expensive. It often requires professional help.

### Control Board Issues

The control board, or main PCB (Printed Circuit Board), is the "brain" of your LG dryer. It sends signals to all the different components, including the heating element, thermostats, igniter, and motor. If the control board is faulty, it might not send the correct signals to activate the heating system. This can result in no heat, intermittent heat, or incorrect temperature settings.

Diagnosing a bad control board can be challenging. There are usually no obvious visual signs of damage, though sometimes you might see burnt spots or swollen capacitors. You typically rule out all other potential issues before suspecting the control board. If all other components test good, but the dryer still does not heat, the control board might be the problem. Replacement control boards can be expensive. Always verify the part number exactly for your LG dryer model. Due to the complexity, I usually suggest a professional handle control board replacements.

## When to Call a Professional for LG Dryer Repair

While many LG dryer heating issues have straightforward fixes, some problems are better left to professionals. Attempting complex repairs without proper knowledge or tools can be dangerous and cause more damage. Knowing when to call a technician saves you time, money, and potential headaches.

### Safety Concerns

Working with appliances involves electricity and, for gas dryers, natural gas or propane. These elements pose significant safety risks if handled improperly. There is a risk of electric shock, gas leaks, and even fire. If you are uncomfortable working with electrical wiring or gas lines, do not attempt the repair yourself. I always advise prioritizing your safety above all else. A qualified professional has the necessary training and equipment to handle these risks safely. They follow strict safety protocols during diagnosis and repair.

### Complex Diagnostics

Some dryer problems are not obvious. For instance, diagnosing a faulty control board or an intermittent wiring issue requires specific expertise and diagnostic tools. Without experience, you might replace multiple parts based on guesswork. This wastes money and still does not solve the underlying problem. Professionals have specialized tools like advanced multimeters and diagnostic software. They use these tools to quickly and accurately pinpoint the exact faulty component. This saves you from trial-and-error repairs.

### Specialized Tools

Certain repairs on an LG dryer require specialized tools that the average homeowner does not own. For example, some components are difficult to reach or remove without specific wrenches or clamps. Gas line work requires specialized tools and leak detection equipment. Attempting a repair without the correct tools can damage parts or the appliance itself. A professional technician arrives with a full toolkit ready for any situation. They have the right tools for disassembly, testing, and reassembly. They also carry common replacement parts, speeding up the repair process significantly. When your LG dryer is not getting hot and you have tried basic steps, consider a professional for efficient and safe service.
