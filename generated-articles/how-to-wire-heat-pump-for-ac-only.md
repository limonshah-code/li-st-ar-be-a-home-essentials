*   **Correct Connections:** Match the thermostat wires to the corresponding terminals on your heat pump and air handler.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** After wiring, test the system's cooling function. Ensure everything operates correctly.

To wire a heat pump for AC only, connect the R (power), Y (cooling call), G (fan), and C (common) wires from the thermostat to their respective terminals on both the indoor air handler and the outdoor condenser. The O/B (reversing valve) wire also connects to ensure the heat pump operates in cooling mode.

## Understanding Heat Pump Components for AC Operation

Before you start wiring, it helps to know the main parts of your heat pump system. A heat pump acts as a two-way air conditioner. It moves heat from inside to outside for cooling. It moves heat from outside to inside for heating. When you want AC only, you tell the system to always move heat outside.

Your system has an indoor unit, also called an air handler or furnace. It has an outdoor unit, often called the condenser or compressor. A thermostat controls both units. Wires connect these three main parts. Each wire carries a specific signal. Knowing what each part does makes wiring easier. It helps you avoid mistakes.

The outdoor unit contains the compressor and condenser coil. These parts are essential for the cooling cycle. The indoor unit contains the evaporator coil and fan. The fan circulates cool air through your home. Both units must communicate correctly for proper AC operation. Understanding these components is your first step. It prepares you for the wiring task.

## Essential Tools and Safety Precautions for Wiring

Working with electricity demands strict safety measures. Always prioritize your safety before starting any wiring project. Electrical shock can cause serious injury or death. It is important to be careful. Do not take shortcuts when handling electrical wires.

Here are the essential tools you will need for this job:

*   **Screwdrivers:** Both Phillips and flathead screwdrivers are needed. These help open access panels and tighten terminal screws.
*   **Wire Strippers:** These tools remove the insulation from wires. They allow for proper electrical contact.
*   **Needle-Nose Pliers:** Useful for bending wires into loops for terminal connections.
*   **Multimeter:** This tool tests for voltage. It confirms the power is off. It also checks for continuity in wires.
*   **Wire Labels/Tape:** Helps you keep track of which wire is which. This is very important.

Now, for the critical safety precautions:

1.  **Disconnect Power:** This is the most crucial step. Go to your circuit breaker panel. Turn off the breaker that supplies power to your heat pump and indoor air handler. Tag the breaker so no one turns it on by accident.
2.  **Verify Power is Off:** Use your multimeter to test for voltage at the thermostat wires and the outdoor unit's disconnect. Confirm zero voltage before touching any wires.
3.  **Wear Safety Gear:** Use insulated gloves and safety glasses. These protect you from accidental shocks and debris.
4.  **Read Manuals:** Always consult your heat pump and thermostat manuals. They provide specific wiring diagrams for your model. Different models might have slight variations.
5.  **Work in Good Light:** Ensure your workspace is well-lit. This helps you see wires clearly and reduce errors.
6.  **Avoid Water:** Keep water away from electrical components. Water conducts electricity.

Following these safety steps protects you. They ensure a successful wiring process. Do not rush any step. Take your time.

## Decoding Thermostat Wires and Their Functions

Thermostat wires are color-coded. Each color usually represents a specific function. Understanding these functions is vital for correctly wiring your heat pump for AC only. This knowledge helps you match the right wire to the right terminal. Incorrect wiring can damage your system or cause it to malfunction.

Here are the common thermostat wire colors and their typical functions:

*   **R (Red):** This is the **24-volt AC power** wire. It provides constant power to the thermostat. You will find it connected to the R or Rh terminal. Sometimes, there is an Rc terminal too. This is for a separate cooling transformer. Most heat pumps use one R wire for both heating and cooling.
*   **Y (Yellow):** This wire controls the **compressor**. When the thermostat calls for cooling, power goes to the Y terminal. This activates the outdoor unit's compressor. The compressor then starts the cooling cycle.
*   **G (Green):** This wire controls the **indoor fan**. When the thermostat calls for heating or cooling, power goes to the G terminal. This turns on the blower fan in your air handler. The fan circulates air through your ducts.
*   **C (Blue/Black - Common):** This is the **common wire**. It provides a continuous 24-volt circuit back to the transformer. Many smart thermostats need a C wire for continuous power. Without it, your thermostat might run on batteries or have intermittent power. It completes the circuit for other components.
*   **O/B (Orange/Blue - Reversing Valve):** This wire is specific to heat pumps. It controls the **reversing valve**. This valve determines if the heat pump operates in heating or cooling mode. For AC only, the O/B wire must be energized in cooling mode. Most heat pumps use an "O" wire, which is energized for cooling. Some older or specific models use a "B" wire, energized for heating. You will need to confirm if your heat pump uses an O wire or a B wire for cooling. [Does your heat pump use an O wire or B wire?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-your-heat-pump-use-an-o-wire-or-b-wire) You can also check your heat pump's manual. Or you can test it to see if your heat pump uses O or B wire. [How to tell if heat pump use O or B wire](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-if-heat-pump-use-o-or-b-wire).
*   **W (White):** This wire usually controls **auxiliary or emergency heat**. Since you are wiring for AC only, this wire might not be connected. If it is present, ensure it is insulated and not touching other terminals. You will not use it for AC operation. [How to put heat pump on emergency heat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-heat-pump-on-emergency-heat) discusses this wire more.

Always take a picture of your existing wiring before disconnecting anything. This gives you a reference point. If your existing wiring is confusing, label each wire as you remove it. This practice reduces errors. Proper identification of these wires is the foundation for correct heat pump wiring.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Wiring for AC Only

Wiring your heat pump for AC only involves connecting the thermostat to the indoor and outdoor units. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a functional cooling system. Remember to keep safety as your top priority throughout the process.

### Step 1: Disconnect Power and Prepare Wires

First, go to your main electrical panel. Find the circuit breakers for your heat pump and indoor air handler. Turn both breakers to the "OFF" position. Use your multimeter to confirm no power is present at the thermostat wires and the outdoor unit's service disconnect. This step is non-negotiable.

Next, remove your old thermostat if you are replacing it. Take a clear photo of the existing wiring. Label each wire with its corresponding terminal letter (R, Y, G, C, O/B, W, etc.) before disconnecting it. This prevents confusion later. If you are starting from scratch, carefully pull the thermostat wire from the wall. Make sure you have enough slack to work with. Strip about 1/4 to 3/8 inch of insulation from the end of each wire using your wire strippers. Be careful not to nick the copper strands.

### Step 2: Wire the Thermostat

Now, you will connect the wires to your new thermostat. Most thermostats have clearly labeled terminals. Match the wire colors to the correct terminals:

*   **R Wire:** Connect the red wire to the R or Rh terminal. If your thermostat has separate R and Rc terminals and only one R wire from the wall, jumper R to Rc if your thermostat requires it. Some thermostats do this internally.
*   **Y Wire:** Connect the yellow wire to the Y terminal. This activates the compressor for cooling.
*   **G Wire:** Connect the green wire to the G terminal. This controls the indoor fan.
*   **C Wire:** Connect the common wire (often blue or black) to the C terminal. This provides continuous 24V power. If your old system did not use a C wire, you might need to run a new wire or use a power stealing kit if your thermostat supports it. Running a dedicated C wire is always preferred.
*   **O/B Wire:** Connect the orange or blue wire to the O/B terminal. For AC only, this wire tells the heat pump to operate in cooling mode. Most heat pumps use 'O' for cooling. If yours uses 'B' for cooling, consult your thermostat manual for settings. Double-check your specific heat pump's manual to verify if it uses O (energized for cooling) or B (energized for heating, de-energized for cooling) as its reversing valve activation.

Ensure all connections are tight. No loose strands of wire should touch other terminals. Push the excess wire back into the wall. Secure the thermostat to the wall plate.

### Step 3: Wire the Indoor Air Handler

The indoor air handler (furnace) also has a control board with terminal connections. These connections must mirror those on your thermostat. Access the control board, usually behind an access panel. Again, take a picture of existing wiring before making changes.

Locate the low-voltage terminal strip on the control board. You will see terminals labeled R, Y, G, C, O/B, W, etc.

*   Connect the R wire from the thermostat to the R terminal on the air handler board.
*   Connect the Y wire from the thermostat to the Y terminal on the air handler board.
*   Connect the G wire from the thermostat to the G terminal on the air handler board.
*   Connect the C wire from the thermostat to the C terminal on the air handler board.
*   Connect the O/B wire from the thermostat to the O/B terminal on the air handler board.

The outdoor unit's low-voltage wires connect to this same control board. Typically, there will be two or three wires running from the air handler to the outdoor unit. These are usually Y, C, and sometimes O/B.

*   Connect the Y wire from the outdoor unit to the Y terminal on the air handler board. This is usually connected in parallel with the thermostat's Y wire.
*   Connect the C wire from the outdoor unit to the C terminal on the air handler board. This is usually connected in parallel with the thermostat's C wire.
*   If your outdoor unit's reversing valve is controlled directly from the outdoor unit, its O/B wire will also connect here. However, most modern systems control the reversing valve from the indoor unit's board based on the thermostat's O/B signal.

Make sure all connections are secure. Ensure no wires are touching components they shouldn't.

### Step 4: Wire the Outdoor Condenser Unit

The outdoor unit typically has a low-voltage control panel. This panel receives signals from the indoor air handler. You will find terminals for Y and C, and sometimes O/B.

*   **Y Wire:** Connect the Y wire coming from the indoor air handler to the Y terminal on the outdoor unit's control board. This wire tells the compressor to turn on.
*   **C Wire:** Connect the C wire coming from the indoor air handler to the C terminal on the outdoor unit's control board. This completes the 24V circuit.
*   **O/B Wire:** If your outdoor unit has a separate O/B terminal, connect the O/B wire from the indoor unit here. However, in many heat pump setups, the O/B signal from the thermostat goes to the indoor unit's board, which then manages the reversing valve logic for the outdoor unit. Confirm your specific heat pump's wiring diagram.

Again, ensure all connections are tight and clean. Secure any loose wiring. Close all access panels on the outdoor unit. Keep the unit clean to maintain its efficiency.

## Configuring Your Thermostat for AC Only Operation

After completing the physical wiring, you must configure your thermostat. This step tells the thermostat how your heat pump system is set up. Proper configuration ensures the system operates only in cooling mode when desired. Most modern thermostats have an installer or professional setup menu. You usually access this menu by holding down a specific button combination for a few seconds. Consult your thermostat's user manual for exact instructions.

Within the setup menu, you will typically find settings for:

*   **System Type (Heat Pump):** You must specify that you have a heat pump system. This distinguishes it from a conventional furnace and AC setup. Select "Heat Pump" as the system type.
*   **Number of Cooling Stages:** Most residential heat pumps have one stage of cooling. If your system is more advanced, it might have two stages. Choose the correct number of stages.
*   **Reversing Valve Control (O or B):** This is a critical setting for AC only operation. You must tell the thermostat whether your heat pump energizes the O/B wire in cooling mode or heating mode.
    *   **"O" (Energized in Cooling):** This is the most common setting for heat pumps. If your heat pump activates the reversing valve with voltage to the "O" terminal for cooling, select "O" in the thermostat settings.
    *   **"B" (Energized in Heating):** Some older or specific heat pump brands use "B" where the reversing valve is energized for heating. If your unit uses "B" for heating, then for cooling, the "B" terminal should be de-energized. Confirm your heat pump's manual. Your thermostat might have a setting for "O/B changeover valve in cool" (meaning O) or "O/B changeover valve in heat" (meaning B). Ensure you select the correct one for your heat pump. [Does my heat pump use O or B wire?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-my-heat-pump-use-o-or-b-wire) provides more details.
*   **Fan Operation:** Confirm the fan settings. You usually have options for "Auto" (fan runs only when cooling or heating is on) or "On" (fan runs continuously). For AC only, "Auto" is typically preferred for energy efficiency.
*   **Auxiliary/Emergency Heat:** Since you are wiring for AC only, ensure any auxiliary or emergency heat stages are disabled or set to "0 stages." This prevents the electric heat strips from activating by accident. This configuration means the thermostat will never call for supplementary heat.

After making all adjustments, exit the installer menu. The thermostat will likely restart or go back to the main screen. These settings are crucial for the heat pump to correctly interpret your cooling commands.

## Testing and Troubleshooting Your AC-Only Setup

Once you finish wiring and thermostat configuration, it is time to test your system. This step confirms everything works correctly. It also helps you identify any potential issues early. Do not skip testing. It ensures a comfortable summer.

### Initial Power-Up and Basic Checks:

1.  **Restore Power:** Go back to your circuit breaker panel. Turn on the breakers for your heat pump and indoor air handler.
2.  **Thermostat Display:** Check if your thermostat powers on. It should display the current temperature and time. If it doesn't, recheck your R and C wire connections. Ensure power is reaching the thermostat.
3.  **Basic Fan Test:** Set your thermostat to "Cool" mode. Set the fan to "On." The indoor fan should start running. If it does not, check the G wire connection at both the thermostat and the air handler.

### Testing Cooling Operation:

1.  **Set to Cool Mode:** Set your thermostat to "Cool" mode.
2.  **Lower Temperature:** Lower the set temperature significantly below the current room temperature. For example, if it's 75°F, set it to 68°F. This tells the system to start cooling.
3.  **Listen for Compressor:** Go outside to your outdoor unit. Within a few minutes, you should hear the compressor kick on. You should also feel air moving out of the top of the outdoor unit. If the compressor does not start, check the Y wire connections. Also, confirm the O/B wire is correctly signaling for cooling mode.
4.  **Check Airflow:** Go inside and feel the air coming from your supply vents. The air should feel cool. It should not feel warm or just ambient. If the air is not cool, several issues could be present. These include low refrigerant, a dirty coil, or an issue with the compressor. [Why does heat pump keep turning on and off?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-heat-pump-keep-turning-on-and-off) might offer insights into related issues.
5.  **Monitor Temperature Drop:** Let the system run for 15-20 minutes. The room temperature displayed on the thermostat should gradually drop.

### Common Troubleshooting Scenarios:

*   **No Power to Thermostat:** Check the circuit breakers. Ensure the R and C wires are correctly connected and receiving 24V. Use a multimeter to verify voltage.
*   **Indoor Fan Not Running:** Confirm the G wire connection. Make sure the thermostat is set to "Fan On" or calling for cooling.
*   **Outdoor Unit Not Starting:** Check the Y wire. Ensure the reversing valve (O/B wire) is set correctly in the thermostat configuration (O for cooling). Make sure the outdoor unit's disconnect switch is on.
*   **System Runs but No Cool Air:**
    *   **Dirty Coils:** Dirty evaporator or condenser coils can restrict airflow and heat exchange. Clean them. [How to clean heat pump coils](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-heat-pump-coils) provides detailed steps.
    *   **Incorrect Reversing Valve Setting:** Double-check your thermostat's O/B setting. If it's set to "B" (energized for heating) but your unit uses "O" for cooling, the heat pump might be trying to heat instead of cool.
    *   **Low Refrigerant:** This is a more serious issue. If everything else seems correct and there is still no cool air, you might have a refrigerant leak or low charge. This requires a professional HVAC technician.
*   **Short Cycling:** The system turns on and off too frequently. This could be due to an oversized unit, a dirty filter, or a thermostat misconfiguration.

If you encounter persistent issues or are unsure about any step, it is always wise to call a qualified HVAC technician. Professional help ensures safety and proper system operation.
