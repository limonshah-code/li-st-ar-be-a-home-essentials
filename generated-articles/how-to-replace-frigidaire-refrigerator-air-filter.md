## Replace Your Frigidaire Refrigerator Air Filter for Freshness

Have you ever opened your refrigerator door only to be met with an unpleasant smell? Food odors can quickly accumulate, affecting the taste and freshness of other items inside. This common issue often signals a need to replace your Frigidaire refrigerator air filter.

I know the importance of a clean, odor-free refrigerator. A well-maintained air filter acts as your fridge's personal air purifier, capturing mold spores, bacteria, and strong food smells. Ignoring this simple component can lead to stale air, diminished food quality, and even reduced appliance efficiency. This article helps you understand the vital role of your Frigidaire air filter. We will then guide you through selecting the correct replacement, locating it within your appliance, and completing the replacement process. Finally, we discuss how to reset indicator lights and maintain optimal refrigerator air quality.

### Takeaway

*   Replace your Frigidaire refrigerator air filter every six months for best results.
*   Locate the filter, typically at the top, side, or near crisper drawers.
*   Twist or snap out the old filter and install the new one.
*   Reset the filter indicator light after replacement.
*   A fresh air filter prevents odors and keeps food tasting better.

**To replace your Frigidaire refrigerator air filter, locate the existing filter housing, usually found at the top, side, or rear interior. Twist or pull out the old filter, then insert the new Frigidaire PureAir or compatible filter until it clicks into place. Finally, reset any filter indicator light on your control panel.**

## Why Your Frigidaire Refrigerator Needs an Air Filter

Your refrigerator does more than just keep food cold. Many modern refrigerators, especially Frigidaire models, include an air filter system. This system works to maintain a clean, fresh internal environment. The filter, often labeled "PureAir," uses activated carbon to absorb odors and contaminants. This means your sliced apples will not taste like the leftover onion from last night.

The primary role of the air filter is odor elimination. Foods like onions, garlic, and certain cheeses release volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These compounds create strong smells that permeate the air inside your refrigerator. The activated carbon in the filter traps these odor molecules. This keeps your produce, dairy, and other items smelling and tasting as they should. Think of it as a constant air purification system for your food storage.

Beyond odors, air filters can also help reduce the presence of airborne mold spores and bacteria. While not a sterilization system, a good air filter contributes to overall hygiene. It captures particles that could settle on food surfaces. Replacing your air filter regularly ensures this protective function remains effective. A clogged filter loses its ability to absorb impurities. This allows odors to build up and potentially cross-contaminate foods. A fresh filter ensures that the air circulating around your food is clean and pure. This simple maintenance step greatly improves food preservation and overall refrigerator performance.

## Does Your Frigidaire Refrigerator Have an Air Filter?

Many Frigidaire refrigerators come equipped with an air filter. However, not all models include this feature. It is important to confirm whether your specific Frigidaire refrigerator has an air filter before attempting to replace one. Checking your owner's manual is always the best first step. The manual will detail all features specific to your model.

You can also visually inspect your refrigerator's interior. Air filters are commonly found in a few key locations. Look near the top of the fresh food compartment. Some models have the filter compartment on the side wall, often labeled "PureAir" or similar. Other filters are located near the crisper drawers or at the back panel inside the fridge. The filter typically sits within a small, often rectangular, housing unit. This housing usually has vents or a grill.

Do not confuse the air filter with the water filter. Frigidaire refrigerators often have both, but they serve different purposes. The water filter is typically a cylindrical cartridge. It is located inside the refrigerator compartment, often in the top right corner, or sometimes in the kickplate at the bottom front. If you are experiencing water leaks from a filter, it is almost certainly a water filter issue, not an air filter problem. For detailed information on whether your specific model has an air filter, you can check resources like [Does My Frigidaire Refrigerator Have an Air Filter?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-my-frigidaire-refrigerator-have-an-air-filter). This will help ensure you are looking for the correct component.

## Choosing the Right Frigidaire PureAir Filter

Selecting the correct replacement filter is crucial for effective odor removal and proper fit. Frigidaire refrigerators use specific air filter models. The most common type is the Frigidaire PureAir filter, often identified by part numbers like EAFCBF, PUREAIR, or PAULTRA. These numbers are usually printed directly on the filter cartridge or its packaging. It is essential to match this part number to ensure compatibility with your appliance.

You can find the exact part number for your refrigerator's air filter in a few places. First, check your refrigerator's owner's manual. It lists all compatible accessories and replacement parts. Second, inspect the existing filter itself. The part number is often molded into the plastic housing of the filter. If you cannot find it, look for a sticker inside your refrigerator with the model and serial number. You can then use this information on the Frigidaire website or a reputable parts dealer's website to find the correct filter.

When purchasing a new filter, you have options between genuine Frigidaire PureAir filters and aftermarket compatible filters. Genuine Frigidaire filters guarantee a perfect fit and performance specifically designed for your appliance. Aftermarket filters can be a more budget-friendly option. However, verify that they are certified or meet industry standards for air filtration. Read reviews and ensure the aftermarket filter explicitly states compatibility with your Frigidaire PureAir system or specific part number. Investing in a quality filter ensures optimal air purification and extends the life of your refrigerator's fresh-keeping capabilities.

## Locating and Accessing the Frigidaire Air Filter Compartment

Before you can replace your Frigidaire refrigerator air filter, you need to find it. The location of the air filter can vary depending on your specific Frigidaire model. However, common placements exist across most Frigidaire refrigerators. Most often, you will find the PureAir filter situated in the upper section of the fresh food compartment. It might be in the ceiling, on a side wall, or tucked behind a removable panel.

For many Frigidaire models, the air filter compartment is located at the top center of the fresh food section. It often has a small, rectangular cover or housing that says "PureAir" or has a filter icon. Other models might place the filter on the right or left sidewall of the refrigerator compartment, often near the front. In some newer or specific designs, the filter may be found closer to the crisper drawers or even integrated into the back wall behind a vent cover. Before you start, turn off the refrigerator's ice maker and dispenser if you have one. You do not need to unplug the refrigerator for this process, but it is good practice to work with care.

Once you have identified the general location, you need to access the filter compartment. This usually involves opening a small door or pressing a tab to release a cover. For filters located in the top center, you might simply need to push a button or slide a latch on the housing. If the filter is on a side wall, look for a release tab or a twist-off cap. Always consult your owner's manual if you are unsure. This ensures you do not damage any plastic components. Proper identification and gentle handling of the filter housing make the replacement process much smoother.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Replacing Your Frigidaire PureAir Filter

Replacing your Frigidaire refrigerator air filter is a straightforward process. You do not need special tools. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a proper replacement and restore fresh air to your refrigerator.

1.  **Prepare the Area:** Open your refrigerator door wide. Make sure you have enough light to clearly see the filter compartment. Having the new filter unwrapped and ready makes the process quicker.
2.  **Locate the Filter:** As discussed, identify where your specific Frigidaire model's air filter is located. This is typically at the top center, on a side wall, or sometimes near the crisper drawers. Look for a small plastic housing, often labeled "PureAir."
3.  **Open the Filter Housing:**
    *   **For top-mounted filters (e.g., PureAir Ultra models):** You usually push in a tab or press a button to release the front cover of the filter housing. The cover will swing down or pop open.
    *   **For side-mounted or twist-in filters:** You might need to twist the outer cap of the filter counter-clockwise until it releases.
    *   **For snap-in filters:** Simply pull or pry gently on the cover to unlatch it. Always use gentle force.
4.  **Remove the Old Filter:**
    *   **For top-mounted filters:** The old filter typically slides out directly once the cover is open. Gently pull it straight out from the slot.
    *   **For twist-in filters:** Once the cap is twisted off, the filter cartridge usually pulls straight out.
    *   **For snap-in filters:** The filter may simply pull away from its clips. Note the orientation of the old filter before removal. Some filters have an arrow indicating airflow.
5.  **Insert the New Filter:**
    *   **For top-mounted filters:** Slide the new Frigidaire PureAir filter into the slot. Ensure it slides in completely and is oriented correctly (e.g., "front" facing out, or arrow pointing in the correct direction if applicable).
    *   **For twist-in filters:** Push the new cartridge into place and twist clockwise until it locks securely.
    *   **For snap-in filters:** Align the new filter with the clips and gently push until it snaps firmly into place.
6.  **Close the Filter Housing:** Close the cover of the filter compartment. Make sure it latches securely. You should hear a click or feel it firmly shut.
7.  **Dispose of the Old Filter:** Wrap the old filter in a plastic bag and dispose of it in your regular trash. It is filled with absorbed odors and contaminants, so proper disposal prevents them from escaping.
8.  **Reset the Indicator Light:** This is a crucial final step. Your refrigerator likely has a "Change Filter" or "Air Filter" indicator light. This light needs to be reset so it accurately tracks the life of your new filter. The reset procedure varies by model but often involves pressing and holding a button on the control panel. We will cover this in detail in the next section.
    Unlike issues such as a leaking water filter, which might require more complex troubleshooting, an air filter replacement is typically very straightforward. If you've ever had to reset your Frigidaire refrigerator after replacing a water filter, you know there is usually a specific button or sequence. The air filter reset process is similar in its simplicity, but involves a different indicator. If you find yourself wondering "Can you clean an LG refrigerator air filter?", remember that Frigidaire PureAir filters are designed for replacement, not cleaning.

By following these steps, you will successfully replace your Frigidaire refrigerator air filter. Your refrigerator's interior air will become fresh and clean.

## Resetting the Frigidaire Air Filter Indicator Light

After you successfully replace your Frigidaire refrigerator air filter, the "Change Filter" or "Air Filter" indicator light will likely remain illuminated. This light serves as a reminder to change the filter. It does not automatically detect the new filter. You must manually reset it. The exact method for resetting this light varies slightly between Frigidaire models. However, common procedures apply to most.

Most Frigidaire models feature a control panel on the dispenser or inside the fresh food compartment. Look for a button specifically labeled "Air Filter," "Filter Reset," or "PureAir." In many cases, you simply press and hold this button for approximately 3 to 5 seconds. The light should then turn off or change color, indicating a successful reset. Some models might require pressing a combination of buttons. For example, you might need to press "Options" and then "Air Filter" or similar.

If your model does not have a dedicated air filter button, check your owner's manual for specific instructions. Sometimes, the air filter reset function is integrated with other utility settings. It might be part of a menu you navigate through. A common alternative is to press and hold the "Options" or "Mode" button, then select "Air Filter Reset" from a displayed menu. Always refer to your exact model's manual for the most accurate reset sequence. Without resetting the light, your refrigerator will continue to remind you to change a filter that is already new. This can cause unnecessary confusion. Resetting the indicator ensures your refrigerator's monitoring system accurately reflects the life of your new air filter. This also helps you know when the next replacement is due.

## Maintaining Optimal Refrigerator Air Quality

Replacing your Frigidaire refrigerator air filter regularly is a key step toward maintaining excellent air quality inside your appliance. However, it is not the only factor. A comprehensive approach ensures your food stays fresh and your refrigerator remains odor-free. Combining filter changes with other good practices yields the best results.

First, proper food storage plays a significant role. Always use airtight containers for strong-smelling foods like onions, garlic, and cheeses. This prevents their odors from permeating the refrigerator's air. Keep fruits and vegetables in their designated crisper drawers, as these are often designed to control humidity and airflow. Expired or spoiled food should be removed immediately. Even a small amount of moldy produce can quickly create unpleasant odors.

Second, regular cleaning of your refrigerator's interior is essential. Spills and crumbs can harbor bacteria and create smells. Wipe down shelves and drawers with a mild soap and water solution, or a mixture of baking soda and water. Pay attention to corners and crevices where debris might accumulate. An annual deep clean helps remove lingering odors and ensures a hygienic environment. While you cannot clean a Frigidaire air filter (they are designed for replacement, unlike some other brands where you might ask, "Can you clean an LG refrigerator air filter?"), keeping the rest of the fridge clean maximizes the filter's effectiveness.

Consider using natural odor absorbers in conjunction with your air filter. An open box of baking soda placed at the back of a shelf can absorb odors between filter changes. Activated charcoal packets, not to be confused with the refrigerator's internal filter, also work well. These extra measures complement the work of your Frigidaire PureAir filter. They create an environment where your food stays fresher for longer. They also ensure every time you open the door, you are met with clean, crisp air.
