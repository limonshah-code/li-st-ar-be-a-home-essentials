## Whirlpool Dishwasher Not Draining? Find Out Why!

Few things are more frustrating than opening your dishwasher to find standing water. If your Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain, you are not alone. This is a common issue many homeowners face. Water left in the tub means dirty dishes remain, and odors can develop. I understand how annoying this problem can be when you just want clean dishes.

You depend on your dishwasher to simplify daily chores. When it stops draining, it feels like a big problem. But many draining issues have simple fixes you can do yourself. This guide helps you understand why your Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain. We will look at common causes and give you clear steps to solve them. You will find out how to get your dishwasher working properly again.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Filters First:** Often, a clogged filter is the culprit. Clean it regularly.
*   **Inspect Drain Hose:** Look for kinks or blockages in the hose.
*   **Clear Air Gap/Sink Drain:** Ensure your kitchen sink drain is clear.
*   **Test Drain Pump:** A faulty drain pump needs replacement.
*   **Consult Error Codes:** Your dishwasher may show a code to tell you what is wrong.

### Why Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Will Not Drain

A Whirlpool dishwasher fails to drain due to clogs in the filter, drain hose, or air gap, or issues with the drain pump, drain valve, or control board. These problems stop water from leaving the wash tub. Fixing these parts typically solves the drainage issue.

## Clogged Drain Filter or Sump Area

One of the most frequent reasons a Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain is a clog in the drain filter or sump area. Food particles, grease, and other debris wash off dishes during cycles. Over time, these small pieces build up. They form a blockage in the filter or inside the sump area at the bottom of the dishwasher. This blockage stops water from flowing freely into the drain pump. It prevents proper drainage.

I always recommend checking this area first. It is easy to access and clean. A dirty filter significantly reduces your dishwasher's ability to drain. It also impacts how well your dishes get clean. A clean filter ensures water can leave the machine as it should.

### How to Clean the Filter and Sump

*   **Remove the lower rack:** Pull out the bottom dish rack to get better access.
*   **Locate the filter:** Whirlpool dishwashers usually have a removable cylindrical filter. It sits at the bottom of the tub. Some models have a flat filter screen.
*   **Twist and lift:** Twist the filter counter-clockwise to unlock it. Then, lift it out.
*   **Rinse with water:** Rinse the filter under running warm water. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away any stuck-on food or grime. Make sure water flows through it easily.
*   **Check the sump:** Look into the sump area where the filter sat. Use a flashlight to see if there are any food chunks or debris. Carefully remove any visible blockages with your hand or a wet/dry vacuum.
*   **Reinstall the filter:** Place the clean filter back into its spot. Twist it clockwise to lock it in place. Ensure it is secure to prevent leaks.

Regular cleaning of your dishwasher filter helps prevent drainage issues. I clean mine every few weeks. This simple task can save you from bigger problems. If your dishwasher still does not drain after cleaning, consider other causes.

## Kinked or Blocked Drain Hose

Another common reason your Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain is a problem with the drain hose. The drain hose connects your dishwasher to your kitchen sink's drain pipe or garbage disposal. It carries the dirty water out of the appliance. This hose can sometimes get kinked or crushed. It can also become blocked with debris.

A kink in the hose acts like a dam, stopping water flow. If you pulled your dishwasher out recently, or if it was just installed, a kink is a likely cause. Debris, such as food waste or grease, can also build up inside the hose over time. This blockage restricts water movement.

### Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose

*   **Pull out the dishwasher:** Carefully pull the dishwasher away from the wall. This gives you access to the back of the unit.
*   **Check the hose for kinks:** Look along the entire length of the drain hose. Smooth out any bends or kinks you find. Ensure the hose has a gentle slope. It must rise higher than the connection point to prevent backflow.
*   **Disconnect the hose:** Turn off the power to the dishwasher first. Then, disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink drain or garbage disposal. Have a bucket ready to catch any residual water.
*   **Clear blockages:** Shine a flashlight into the hose ends. Look for any visible obstructions. You can use a stiff wire or a plumber's snake to dislodge any blockages inside the hose. Flush the hose with water to ensure it is clear.
*   **Check the connection points:** Inspect the connection point at the sink drain or garbage disposal. Sometimes, a blockage occurs right where the hose connects. Make sure the knockout plug is removed if your hose connects to a new garbage disposal.
*   **Reattach the hose:** Once clear, reattach the drain hose securely. Ensure all clamps are tight. Push the dishwasher back into place.

Addressing a drain hose issue is often a straightforward fix. It requires a bit of effort but no special tools. Proper drain hose maintenance can help avoid future problems.

## Malfunctioning Drain Pump

The drain pump is a vital part of your Whirlpool dishwasher's drainage system. Its job is to force the water out of the dishwasher and into the drain line. If your Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain, and you have checked the filter and hose, the drain pump might be faulty. A drain pump can fail due to electrical issues, a worn motor, or an object lodged inside it.

You might hear a humming sound from the dishwasher but no water draining. This often points to a pump trying to work but unable to. Sometimes, you might hear nothing at all. This means the pump is not getting power or has failed completely. Replacing a drain pump can be a DIY task for those comfortable with appliance repair.

### Steps to Check and Replace the Drain Pump

*   **Disconnect power:** Always disconnect the dishwasher from its power source before doing any work. Turn off the circuit breaker.
*   **Access the pump:** The drain pump is usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher. You may need to remove the lower access panel to reach it. Some models require pulling the dishwasher out and tilting it.
*   **Inspect for foreign objects:** Look closely at the pump's impeller area. Small items like glass shards, broken plastic, or fruit pits can get stuck. These objects stop the impeller from spinning. Remove any debris carefully.
*   **Test the pump:** If you own a multimeter, you can test the pump for electrical continuity. A reading of infinity (open circuit) means the pump has failed. You can also test if the pump motor receives power during the drain cycle. You can learn more about testing methods here: [How to Test Whirlpool Dishwasher Drain Pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-whirlpool-dishwasher-drain-pump).
*   **Remove and replace:** If the pump is faulty, disconnect the hoses and wiring. Then, unmount the old pump. Install the new drain pump, ensuring all connections are secure.
*   **Run a test cycle:** After replacement, restore power. Run a quick rinse cycle to check if the dishwasher drains properly. Listen for any unusual noises.

A functioning drain pump is essential for your dishwasher to complete its cycle. If you are unsure about replacing it yourself, calling a qualified technician is a good idea.

## Issues with the Air Gap or Kitchen Sink Drain

Your Whirlpool dishwasherâ€™s drain system often connects to your kitchen sink plumbing. This means blockages in your sink or a specific part called an air gap can prevent your dishwasher from draining. An air gap is a small, cylindrical device mounted on your sink or countertop. It prevents dirty water from the sink from flowing back into the dishwasher.

If your kitchen sink drains slowly, or if the air gap is clogged, your dishwasher will not drain. The dishwasher's drain hose might connect directly to a garbage disposal. If the disposal has food waste in it, this also affects drainage. It is important to check these external plumbing connections.

### Checking the Air Gap and Sink Drain

*   **Inspect the air gap:** Remove the chrome cap from the air gap device on your sink. Then, remove the plastic cap underneath. Look for any debris inside. Use a small brush or piece of wire to clear out any gunk.
*   **Check air gap hoses:** The air gap has two hoses connected to it. One comes from the dishwasher. The other goes to the garbage disposal or sink drain. Disconnect these hoses and check them for blockages. Clear any debris you find.
*   **Run the garbage disposal:** If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, run the disposal first. Make sure it is completely clear of food waste. Many people forget this simple step.
*   **Clear the sink drain:** If your kitchen sink drains slowly, it likely has a clog. This clog can affect the dishwasher's ability to drain. Use a plunger or a drain cleaner to clear the sink drain. Hot water and dish soap can sometimes help.
*   **Check the knockout plug:** If you recently installed a new garbage disposal, ensure the knockout plug was removed. This plug blocks the dishwasher's drain line. It must be removed for the dishwasher to drain.

Addressing issues with your air gap or kitchen sink drain is a crucial step. It often resolves non-draining problems without needing to open the dishwasher itself. Always make sure these parts of your plumbing system are clear and working correctly.

## Faulty Drain Valve or Solenoid

While less common than clogs or pump issues, a faulty drain valve or its associated solenoid can also cause your Whirlpool dishwasher to not drain. The drain valve controls the flow of water out of the dishwasher tub. It opens when the pump activates to allow water to exit. If this valve sticks closed or does not open fully, water will remain in the tub.

The drain solenoid is an electrical component. It controls the opening and closing of the drain valve. If the solenoid fails, it cannot tell the valve to open. This prevents drainage. Problems with these parts usually mean internal component failure. They require more specific troubleshooting.

### Diagnosing and Repairing the Drain Valve/Solenoid

*   **Locate the drain valve:** The drain valve is typically near the drain pump at the bottom of the dishwasher. You will need to access the underside of the appliance. Always disconnect power first.
*   **Inspect the valve:** Check the valve for any visible debris that might be stopping it from opening. Sometimes, small pieces of food or plastic can get lodged there.
*   **Test the solenoid:** Use a multimeter to test the drain solenoid for continuity. If there is no continuity, the solenoid is faulty and needs replacement. You can also visually inspect the solenoid for burnt wires or other damage.
*   **Check electrical connections:** Ensure all wires connected to the drain valve and solenoid are secure and not corroded. Loose connections can prevent proper operation.
*   **Manual operation check (if possible):** Some drain valves can be manually opened or closed. Refer to your Whirlpool dishwasher's service manual to see if this is an option for your model. This can help determine if the valve itself is stuck.
*   **Replace faulty parts:** If the drain valve or solenoid is defective, they generally need replacement. These parts are usually purchased as a single unit or pair. Replacing them involves disconnecting the old unit and attaching the new one. Ensure you connect all wires correctly.

Dealing with internal components like the drain valve requires care. If you are not comfortable working with electrical parts or internal mechanisms, it is best to call a professional technician. Proper identification of the part helps.

## Control Board or Sensor Problems

Modern Whirlpool dishwashers rely on electronic control boards and sensors to manage all cycles. This includes the drain cycle. If your Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain, even after checking the mechanical components, the problem might be with the main control board or a related sensor. The control board acts as the brain of the dishwasher. It sends signals to components like the drain pump and drain valve.

A faulty control board might not send the correct signal to start the drain cycle. A malfunctioning sensor might incorrectly report that the water has already drained. This could stop the pump from activating. These issues are less common but can be frustrating because they are harder to diagnose without specialized tools.

### Troubleshooting Electronic Issues

*   **Reset the dishwasher:** First, try a simple reset. Disconnect power to the dishwasher at the circuit breaker for about 5 minutes. Then, restore power. This can clear minor electronic glitches.
*   **Check for error codes:** Many Whirlpool dishwashers display error codes on the control panel. These codes can point to specific problems, including drainage issues. Consult your owner's manual to understand what each code means. This is a very useful diagnostic step.
*   **Inspect wiring:** Look for any loose, burnt, or corroded wires connected to the control board or sensors. Faulty wiring can prevent signals from reaching the drain pump or valve.
*   **Test sensors:** Some dishwashers have flood sensors or turbidity sensors. A faulty flood sensor might prevent draining by thinking the tub is empty or overflowing. Testing these requires a multimeter and knowledge of expected readings.
*   **Consider professional help:** If you suspect a control board or sensor issue, it is often best to call an appliance repair technician. These parts are expensive, and diagnosing them requires expertise. An incorrect diagnosis can lead to unnecessary part replacement.

While it is tempting to replace the control board immediately, remember it is often a last resort. Always rule out simpler mechanical issues first. Electronic problems are complex. Getting expert help ensures you fix the right thing.

## Improper Dishwasher Installation

Sometimes, the reason a Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain comes down to how it was installed. Incorrect installation can create long-term drainage problems. One common issue is an improperly looped drain hose. The drain hose needs to have a high loop. This loop must be higher than the connection point to the sink drain or garbage disposal.

Without this high loop, dirty water from the sink can flow back into the dishwasher. This is called siphoning. It can leave standing water at the bottom of the tub. Another installation issue relates to the air gap. If the air gap is not installed correctly or is clogged from the start, drainage will suffer.

### Correcting Installation-Related Drain Issues

*   **Check the high loop:** Look behind or beside your dishwasher. Ensure the drain hose rises up, forming a high loop, before it drops down to connect to the sink drain or garbage disposal. This loop should be secured to the underside of the countertop.
*   **Install an air gap (if needed):** If your local plumbing codes require an air gap, make sure it is installed and functioning. It prevents dirty water backflow. If it is clogged, clean it as discussed earlier.
*   **Verify hose connections:** Double-check that all drain hose connections are tight and secure. Loose connections can lead to leaks or inefficient draining.
*   **Ensure proper slope:** The drain hose needs a slight downward slope from the dishwasher to the drain connection point, after the high loop. This helps gravity assist water flow.
*   **Review installation manual:** If you still have the installation manual for your Whirlpool dishwasher, review the section on drain hose setup. Follow the manufacturer's specific instructions. They often have diagrams showing the correct hose configuration.

Proper installation is key for any appliance. It ensures reliable operation and prevents many common problems. If your dishwasher was recently installed and you are having draining issues, reviewing the installation is a smart first step. It is often a quick fix that avoids deeper repairs.

## Understanding Whirlpool Dishwasher Error Codes

Your Whirlpool dishwasher can tell you a lot about its problems if you know where to look. Many models feature a digital display or indicator lights. These show specific error codes when a problem occurs. If your Whirlpool dishwasher will not drain, checking for these codes is a smart move. An error code provides a direct hint about the underlying issue. It can save you a lot of troubleshooting time.

Each code points to a different system or component that has malfunctioned. For example, a code might indicate a drain pump failure, a water level sensor problem, or even a communication error with the control board. Knowing the code helps you narrow down your diagnosis.

### Common Drain-Related Error Codes and Their Meanings

*   **F2/E2 or F8/E8 (Flood Sensor/Overflow):** These codes often mean the dishwasher detects too much water in the tub. This might be due to a true overflow or a faulty flood sensor. A clogged drain preventing water from leaving can trigger this.
*   **F3/E3 (Heating Element/Thermostat):** While not directly a drain code, some models might not drain if they detect a heating issue. This is less common but worth noting.
*   **F6/E6 (Water Inlet):** This code means there is a problem with water filling. If the dishwasher cannot fill properly, it might get stuck in a cycle. This could affect subsequent draining. This situation highlights how a fill issue can influence drainage. You can find more details here: [Why Wont My Whirlpool Dishwasher Fill With Water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-fill-with-water).
*   **F7/E7 (Flow Meter):** This code points to a problem with the flow meter. It could mean the dishwasher is not sensing water flow correctly. This can confuse the control board and affect draining.
*   **F9/E9 (Drain Pump/Drainage):** This is one of the most direct codes for drainage problems. It typically indicates an issue with the drain pump or a blockage in the drain line. This code strongly suggests inspecting the drain pump and hose.
*   **Sudden flashes or unresponsive panel:** If the control panel is flashing erratically or is completely unresponsive, it could indicate a general control board problem.

Always refer to your specific Whirlpool dishwasher's owner's manual to interpret error codes. The meaning can vary slightly between models. Once you identify the code, you can focus your troubleshooting efforts on the related component. This systematic approach speeds up the repair process. If you do not have your manual, try searching online with your model number and "error codes."
