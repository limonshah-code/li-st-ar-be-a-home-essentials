### How do you recover a storage ottoman?

To recover a storage ottoman, you first remove the old fabric and hardware. Then, you measure and cut new upholstery fabric. Next, you carefully staple the new fabric onto the ottoman frame, starting with the base and then the lid. Finally, you reattach all hardware and decorative elements.

## Why Recover Your Storage Ottoman?

You might wonder why you should bother recovering an old storage ottoman when new ones are readily available. The reasons are compelling and go beyond simple aesthetics. Deciding to recover your ottoman offers significant benefits. These advantages include financial savings, creative freedom, and environmental impact. It allows you to transform an ordinary item into a special piece.

First, consider the cost. Purchasing a brand-new storage ottoman can be expensive, especially if you want specific features or high-quality materials. By recovering your existing ottoman, you primarily pay for materials like fabric, batting, and staples. This often amounts to a fraction of the cost of a new piece of furniture. You keep your hard-earned money in your pocket.

Second, think about personalization. When you recover your ottoman, you are not limited to what is available in stores. You get to choose the exact fabric, color, and pattern that matches your current decor. This means your ottoman will truly complement your existing furniture and express your unique style. It becomes a custom-made item without the custom-made price tag.

Finally, there is the environmental benefit. Repurposing furniture reduces waste. It keeps items out of landfills. This is a responsible choice for our planet. Giving an old piece a new life helps minimize your carbon footprint. It helps you contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. Recovering your ottoman is a smart choice for your wallet, your home, and the environment. It is a win-win solution for everyone.

## Gathering Your Tools and Materials for Ottoman Recovery

Before you begin the exciting process of giving your storage ottoman a new look, gathering all necessary tools and materials is important. Having everything at hand prevents interruptions and makes the project smoother. Think of this as preparing your workspace for a successful operation. You will need a mix of basic hand tools and specific upholstery supplies.

The most important item is your new fabric. Measure your ottoman carefully. Consider how much fabric you will need for the base, lid, and any side panels. A good rule of thumb is to measure each section and add extra for wrapping around edges and potential mistakes. Durable upholstery fabric like linen, velvet, or heavy cotton blends works best for high-traffic items. You want a fabric that can withstand daily use and still look great.

Next, a powerful staple gun is essential. I prefer an electric or pneumatic staple gun for this type of work, as it saves your hands from fatigue and ensures staples go in securely. Make sure you have plenty of staples that are long enough to penetrate the fabric and into the ottoman's wood frame. A flathead screwdriver or tack puller is crucial for removing old staples. A pair of sharp fabric scissors will give you clean cuts.

You will also need a fabric marker or chalk for tracing, a tape measure for precise measurements, and possibly some new batting or foam if the existing padding is worn. Batting adds a soft layer and smooth finish. Safety glasses protect your eyes from flying staples or dust. Gloves can protect your hands. If you plan to add decorative details like piping or buttons, you might need a sewing machine and specialized upholstery needles. Having these items ready will set you up for success.

## Dismantling Your Storage Ottoman

The first active step in recovering your storage ottoman is carefully dismantling it. This process involves removing the old fabric and any hardware. It is important to approach this step methodically. You want to preserve the ottoman's structure and components for reassembly. Think of this as an archaeological dig. You are uncovering the layers to reveal the base.

Begin by removing any decorative elements like trim, piping, or buttons. Use a seam ripper or small flathead screwdriver to gently pry these away. Be careful not to damage the underlying wood or padding. Next, identify how the ottoman's lid attaches to the base. Most storage ottomans have hinges connecting the lid to the back of the base. Unscrew these hinges. Store the screws and hinges together in a small bag so you do not lose them.

### Documenting the Disassembly

Before you start ripping away the old fabric, take a moment to document how it was attached. I always recommend taking photos or even a short video of each step. This visual record will be invaluable when you apply the new fabric. Pay close attention to how the corners are folded, where the staples are placed, and how different sections of fabric meet. This is your guide for reassembly.

Use your tack puller or flathead screwdriver to carefully pry up old staples. Work slowly and patiently. Removing every old staple is important to ensure a smooth surface for your new fabric. As you remove the old fabric, try to keep the larger pieces intact. These can serve as templates for cutting your new fabric later. Mark them with their original location (e.g., "front," "lid top," "side"). This organization saves time and reduces errors.

### Inspecting and Repairing the Frame

Once the old fabric is removed, inspect the ottoman's wooden frame. Look for any loose joints, cracks, or damage. This is the perfect time to make any necessary repairs. Use wood glue and clamps to reinforce wobbly joints. If a piece of wood is cracked, you might need to reinforce it with a small brace or a new piece of wood. A strong frame provides a solid foundation for your new upholstery. For those interested in how ottomans are structured or how to convert existing furniture into storage, understanding the basics of an ottoman's build is helpful. You can learn more about how to turn a regular ottoman into a storage ottoman.

## Cutting and Preparing Your New Fabric

With your storage ottoman dismantled and its frame ready, the next critical step is to prepare your new fabric. Precision in measuring and cutting is key to a professional-looking finish. This stage is where your design vision begins to take physical form. Taking your time here will prevent costly mistakes.

The best way to ensure accurate fabric pieces is to use the old fabric as a template. Lay out each piece of the old fabric flat on your new material. Make sure the grain of the new fabric aligns correctly. Trace around each old piece with a fabric marker or tailor's chalk. Remember to add a seam allowance of 2-3 inches around all edges. This extra fabric allows for easy gripping and stapling. It also provides flexibility for adjustments.

For parts of the ottoman that are curved or have irregular shapes, trace the old fabric very carefully. You may need to make small relief cuts in the seam allowance of the new fabric later. These cuts will allow the fabric to curve smoothly without bunching. When working with patterned fabric, pay close attention to pattern matching. If your fabric has a distinct design, consider how the pattern will look across different sections of the ottoman, especially the lid and the base. You want the pattern to flow seamlessly or at least align pleasingly.

### Applying New Batting or Foam

Now is also the time to address the padding. If the existing batting or foam is compressed, lumpy, or simply too thin, replace it. Cut new foam to size if needed for the lid or top surfaces. Then, apply a layer of upholstery batting over all surfaces that will be covered by fabric. Batting provides a smooth, plump finish. It adds comfort and helps the fabric lay evenly. Use a spray adhesive designed for upholstery to attach the batting to the frame or old padding. This keeps it in place as you apply the fabric. This attention to detail in padding will significantly improve the final look and feel of your recovered ottoman.

## Upholstering the Ottoman Base and Lid

This is the core of the recovery process, where your storage ottoman truly begins its transformation. Upholstering involves carefully stretching and stapling the new fabric onto the frame. It requires patience and a good eye for smooth lines. I find it easiest to work on the base first, then the lid. This approach allows you to manage one section at a time.

### Recovering the Base Section

Start with the largest pieces of fabric for the ottoman's base. Drape the fabric over one side, ensuring it hangs evenly. Begin stapling from the center of one edge, working outwards towards the corners. Pull the fabric taut as you go, but not so tight that it distorts the pattern or creates ripples. Leave the corners for last. When you reach a corner, neatly fold the fabric as if wrapping a gift. Trim away excess fabric to reduce bulk. You might need to make small cuts in the fabric to help it conform to the curves. This part is a bit like fitting a custom suit; every fold counts. For similar techniques on other furniture, exploring how to recover a sofa cushion can provide helpful insights into general upholstery practices.

Work your way around all four sides of the base, stapling securely. Ensure staples are close enough to hold the fabric firmly but not so close that they weaken the wood. Overlapping staples are better than gaps. Once the sides are done, flip the ottoman over and attach the fabric to the bottom edge. Again, pull it taut and staple. Trim any excess fabric close to the staples for a clean finish.

### Recovering the Lid Section

The lid of a storage ottoman often has more structure and may require more careful handling. If your lid has a padded top, ensure the new batting is smooth and evenly distributed. Center your new fabric over the lid. Begin by stapling the fabric to the underside of the lid, starting from the middle of each side. Pull the fabric firmly to ensure there are no wrinkles on the top surface. Work your way around, leaving the corners for last.

For the corners of the lid, you will often need to create neat pleats or gathers. Experiment with different folding techniques to find what looks best with your fabric and the ottoman's shape. You want a clean, tailored look. Once the top is secured, trim the excess fabric. Then, attach the fabric to the side edges of the lid, if applicable. Some lids might have a continuous piece of fabric that wraps over the top and down the sides. For projects involving detailed upholstery, like adding buttons, understanding how to reupholster an ottoman with buttons can provide advanced techniques for a truly custom finish.

## Reassembling Your Recovered Ottoman

You have completed the meticulous work of upholstering the individual parts of your storage ottoman. Now comes the satisfying step of putting it all back together. This stage brings your newly recovered pieces to life as a functional and beautiful item. Proper reassembly ensures both the structural integrity and the smooth operation of your ottoman.

Begin by reattaching the legs to the ottoman base. Line up the screw holes with those on the frame and carefully screw them back in. If the old screw holes are stripped, you might need to use slightly larger screws or fill the old holes with wood filler and drill new pilot holes. Ensure the legs are secure and the ottoman sits level. This stability is important for its use and longevity.

Next, focus on the lid. If your ottoman lid is designed to lift off, simply place it back into position. However, most storage ottomans feature hinges that connect the lid to the base, allowing for easy access to the storage compartment. Carefully align the hinges with the screw holes on both the lid and the base. It is often helpful to have another person assist you here. One person can hold the lid steady while the other screws the hinges back into place. Start with just one screw in each hinge, check the alignment and movement of the lid, and then insert the remaining screws.

### Ensuring Proper Lid Closure and Function

Test the lid's movement thoroughly. It should open and close smoothly without catching or rubbing against the base. If it feels stiff or misaligned, loosen the hinge screws slightly and make small adjustments until the movement is fluid. You want the lid to sit flush with the base when closed, maintaining the clean lines of your newly recovered piece.

Finally, reattach any remaining hardware or decorative elements that you removed at the beginning. This might include handles, decorative tacks, or protective glides on the bottom of the legs. Take pride in your work. Your storage ottoman now looks completely new, offering both style and practicality.

## Adding Finishing Touches and Care Tips

After successfully recovering your storage ottoman, you are in the home stretch! This final stage focuses on adding those personal touches that elevate your DIY project from good to great. It also includes important tips for maintaining your ottoman's fresh new look. These details ensure your ottoman serves you well for years.

### Decorative Elements

Now is your chance to add decorative elements that enhance the ottoman's overall design. You might consider adding decorative nailhead trim along the bottom edge or around the lid. This adds a sophisticated, tailored finish. You can apply nailhead trim individually or use continuous strips for a faster application. For a tufted look, you could add buttons, a technique often seen in more elaborate upholstery projects. If you previously explored how to reupholster an ottoman with buttons, now is the time to apply that knowledge.

Another option is to add cording or piping. This can be sewn into the seams of the fabric or applied as an accent. Piping provides a crisp, defined edge. You can use matching fabric or a contrasting color for a bold statement. Small details like these make a big difference in the perceived quality of your recovered piece. Don't forget new legs if the old ones were worn or if you want to change the style. Even different glides can change the feel.

### Care and Maintenance Tips

To keep your newly recovered storage ottoman looking its best, proper care is important. The cleaning instructions will depend on the type of fabric you chose. For most upholstery fabrics, regular vacuuming with a brush attachment will remove dust and crumbs. This simple step prevents dirt from embedding in the fibers.

For spills, act quickly. Blot the spill with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain. Most fabrics can be spot cleaned with a mild soap and water solution, but always test in an inconspicuous area first. For tough stains or specific fabric types, consult professional cleaning advice or the fabric manufacturer's guidelines. Protecting your ottoman from direct sunlight will prevent fading. Consider using it in different ways, like learning how to use an ottoman as a coffee table, which might influence its placement and sun exposure. Placing it away from heat sources also helps preserve the fabric. Regular maintenance will keep your ottoman beautiful and functional for a long time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much fabric do I need for a storage ottoman?
The amount of fabric needed depends on the ottoman's size and shape. A general estimate is 3-5 yards for a standard rectangular storage ottoman. Measure the top, sides, and lid individually, adding 2-3 inches extra for wrapping and stapling around edges. It is always better to buy slightly more fabric than you think you will need to account for pattern matching or mistakes.

### Can I paint a storage ottoman instead of recovering it?
Yes, you can paint a storage ottoman instead of recovering it, especially if it has a hard, non-upholstered surface or visible wooden legs. Fabric painting is also an option for upholstered ottomans, but it can make the fabric stiff and is best suited for less-used pieces. For a true refresh of an upholstered surface, recovering offers a softer, more durable finish.

### What are the best fabrics for an ottoman?
The best fabrics for an ottoman are durable and easy to clean. Good choices include heavy-duty cottons, linen blends, velvet, microfibers, or performance fabrics designed for upholstery. Consider your ottoman's use. High-traffic areas benefit from stain-resistant and tightly woven fabrics. If you have pets or children, choose a fabric that can withstand wear and tear.

### How long does it take to recover an ottoman?
The time it takes to recover an ottoman varies based on your experience level and the complexity of the ottoman's design. For a simple storage ottoman, a beginner might take 6-10 hours. An experienced DIYer might complete it in 3-5 hours. This includes dismantling, cutting fabric, upholstering, and reassembly. Allow extra time for repairs or detailed work.

### Do I need to remove the old fabric before recovering?
Yes, it is highly recommended to remove the old fabric before recovering a storage ottoman. Removing the old fabric ensures a smooth, even surface for your new material. It prevents lumps and bumps that can show through. It also allows you to inspect the frame for any necessary repairs. The old fabric pieces can also serve as valuable templates for cutting your new fabric.
