### What Do Lights Mean On Kitchenaid Dishwasher?

Lights on a KitchenAid dishwasher communicate its status or signal a problem. They show cycle progress, indicate low rinse aid, or alert you to issues like a clogged filter or a water supply fault. Understanding these visual cues helps you operate and maintain your appliance effectively. Each light pattern or indicator has a specific message.

## Decoding Common KitchenAid Status Lights

Your KitchenAid dishwasher uses various lights to show its current operating state. These are not error messages, but status indicators. They help you track the progress of your wash cycle. Knowing these lights helps you understand what your dishwasher is doing. You will know if it is washing, rinsing, or drying.

### "Clean" Light: Your Cycle is Done

The "Clean" light is a welcome sight on your KitchenAid dishwasher. It illuminates when a wash cycle successfully finishes. This light tells you your dishes are clean and ready for unloading. You can open the dishwasher door and put your sparkling clean dishes away. This light ensures you never wonder if a cycle completed.

The "Clean" light often stays on until you open the dishwasher door. Some models might turn it off after a period. If this light stays on without running a cycle, it might indicate a stuck sensor. Try running a short cycle to reset it. This light is a simple message: your work is done, enjoy your clean dishes.

### "Sanitize" Light: Extra Clean Dishes

The "Sanitize" light shows your dishwasher performed a high-temperature wash and rinse. This feature kills bacteria and other germs on your dishes. It is a vital indicator for those who need extra clean results. This light activates only when you select the "Sanitize" option.

When the "Sanitize" light turns on, it confirms the cycle reached specific temperature standards. This ensures proper sanitation. If it blinks, the cycle might not have reached the correct temperature. This could be due to a water heating issue or a prolonged door opening. Check your water heater settings if this happens.

### "Wash" or "Rinse" Lights: Cycle Progress

Your KitchenAid dishwasher uses lights like "Wash," "Rinse," or other specific stage indicators. These lights show the current phase of the wash cycle. For instance, a "Wash" light means your dishwasher is actively cleaning dishes. A "Rinse" light signals it is rinsing away soap.

These lights help you track how far along the cycle is. They offer a visual cue of the dishwasher's actions. If a light gets stuck on one stage for too long, it might point to a problem. A delay could indicate a sensor issue or a clog. Observe these lights to understand cycle flow.

### "Dry" Light: Dishes Are Ready

The "Dry" light tells you the dishwasher is in the drying phase. This means the wash and rinse parts are finished. Your dishes are almost ready to put away. Most KitchenAid dishwashers use heat or air dry systems.

The "Dry" light stays on until the drying cycle ends. If it blinks, there might be a problem with the heating element or fan. This could leave your dishes wet. Ensure your rinse aid dispenser has enough product for best drying results. Insufficient rinse aid can impact drying efficiency.

### "Cycle Complete" Indicator: End of the Wash

Some KitchenAid models feature a specific "Cycle Complete" indicator light. This light simply confirms the entire wash and dry process has finished. It is a clear signal that your dishes are ready for unloading. This light usually stays on until you open the door or press a button.

This indicator is similar to the "Clean" light but often covers the full cycle, including drying. If this light fails to come on after a cycle, it might mean the cycle was interrupted. Check if the door was opened during operation or if power was lost. A full cycle completion is important for hygiene.

## KitchenAid Warning and Error Lights Explained

Beyond status indicators, KitchenAid dishwashers also use lights to warn you of problems. These lights need your attention. They can signal anything from a low rinse aid level to a severe mechanical fault. Understanding these signals helps you prevent bigger issues. You can address small problems before they become costly repairs.

### "Control Lock" Light: Keeping Settings Safe

The "Control Lock" light on your KitchenAid dishwasher is a safety feature. This light shows that the control panel buttons are locked. This prevents accidental changes to cycle settings. It also stops children from starting the dishwasher. The light turns on when you activate the lock feature.

To unlock the controls, press and hold the "Control Lock" button for a few seconds. The exact time varies by model. Refer to your owner's manual for precise instructions. If the "Control Lock" light stays on and you cannot turn it off, there might be a control panel issue.

4.  **Restore Power:** Plug the dishwasher back in or flip the breaker back to the "On" position.
5.  **Test:** Try running a short wash cycle to see if the blinking lights stop.

This simple reset can resolve many temporary issues. It is a good first step for almost any unexplained light behavior.

### Checking Water Supply and Drain

Water flow is crucial for any dishwasher. Issues with water supply or drainage often cause error lights. You must ensure both are functioning correctly. Checking these components is straightforward.

*   **Water Inlet:**
    *   **Main Water Valve:** Ensure the main water supply valve to your house is open.
    *   **Dishwasher Water Valve:** Check the shut-off valve under your sink or behind the dishwasher. Make sure it is fully open.
    *   **Inlet Hose:** Look for kinks or twists in the water inlet hose. Straighten any you find.
*   **Drainage System:**
    *   **Drain Hose:** Check the drain hose for clogs or kinks. This hose connects the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal.
    *   **Air Gap:** If you have an air gap on your sink, check if it is clear. Food debris can block it.
    *   **Garbage Disposal:** If your drain hose connects to a garbage disposal, ensure the disposal is clear. Run the disposal before starting the dishwasher. Also, check if the knockout plug was removed during installation.

Proper water flow ensures your dishwasher fills, cleans, and drains correctly. Blockages interrupt this process, leading to error lights.

### Inspecting Filters and Spray Arms

A dirty filter or blocked spray arms reduce cleaning performance and can trigger error lights. These are common culprits for dishwasher issues. Regular inspection and cleaning prevent many problems. You can learn more about cleaning your KitchenAid dishwasher [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-kitchenaid-dishwasher).

*   **Dishwasher Filter:**
    *   **Location:** KitchenAid dishwashers typically have a filter at the bottom of the tub. It is usually a cylindrical or flat mesh screen.
    *   **Removal:** Twist or unclip the filter to remove it. Your owner's manual shows exact steps.
    *   **Cleaning:** Rinse the filter under running water. Use a soft brush to remove food particles and grease. A little dish soap can help.
