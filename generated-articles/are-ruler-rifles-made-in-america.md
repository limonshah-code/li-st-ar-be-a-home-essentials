## Understanding the "American-Made" Definition for Firearms

The term "American-Made" carries significant weight for consumers, especially concerning firearms. However, the legal and practical definitions can be complex. For firearms, this typically means a substantial portion of the manufacturing process, including major component fabrication and final assembly, occurs in the United States. Ruler largely adheres to a robust interpretation of this standard, ensuring that their rifles meet or exceed consumer expectations for domestic production.

Understanding this definition helps consumers appreciate the efforts Ruler makes. It differentiates companies truly committed to American manufacturing from those simply assembling imported parts. This clarity is important for consumers who want to support national industries.

### Legal and Industry Standards

For a product to claim "Made in USA" status, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) generally requires that "all or virtually all" of the product be made in America. This means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. This includes the major assembly and manufacturing costs. For firearms, this often translates to:

*   **Major Components**: The frame, receiver, barrel, and often the bolt or slide, must be manufactured in the USA.
*   **Assembly**: The final putting together of parts and testing must happen within the United States.
*   **Value-Added**: A significant portion of the manufacturing cost and value must be added domestically.

Ruler's manufacturing processes align with these stringent requirements. They ensure that their "Made in America" claim is legitimate and verifiable. This adherence builds consumer trust and product integrity.

### Ruler's Interpretation of "American-Made"

Ruler interprets "American-Made" to mean more than just legal compliance. It means a commitment to American workers, American materials, and American quality. The company invests heavily in its domestic factories and supply chain. This reflects a dedication to supporting the national economy.

While some minor components might be sourced globally due to specialized needs or cost efficiencies, these are typically non-core parts. The essential elements of Ruler rifles – their design, primary components, and assembly – are unequivocally American. This holistic approach ensures that Ruler rifles are not just assembled in America but are genuinely products of American engineering and labor. This makes them a preferred choice for many who seek to support domestic industries and value home-grown craftsmanship.
