## Can You Safely Put Your Scrunchie In The Washing Machine?

Have you ever looked at your favorite scrunchie and wondered how to make it feel fresh again? Over time, hair products, sweat, and daily wear leave scrunchies looking a bit dull. Keeping them clean is important for both hygiene and maintaining their look. The big question often comes up: **can you put a scrunchie in the washing machine?** Many people think delicate items require only hand washing. But I am here to tell you that with the right approach, machine washing scrunchies is often possible and quite effective. This article guides you through the process. We will cover fabric types, preparation steps, machine settings, and proper drying methods. By the end, you will know exactly how to clean your scrunchies safely and efficiently.

### Takeaway

*   Most scrunchies can go into a washing machine.
*   Always check the fabric type before washing.
*   Use a mesh laundry bag to protect scrunchies.
*   Choose a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent.
*   Air dry scrunchies for best results and to prevent damage.

Yes, you can often put a scrunchie in the washing machine. However, success depends on the scrunchie's fabric and any embellishments it has. Use a delicate cycle, cold water, and a laundry bag to protect them. Hand washing is better for very delicate materials like silk or those with fragile decorations.

## Understanding Scrunchie Fabrics and Their Washability

Different scrunchie fabrics require different care. Knowing the material helps you decide if machine washing is safe. You want to keep your scrunchies looking good and lasting long. I always check the fabric before I start any washing process.

### Cotton and Jersey Scrunchies

Cotton and jersey scrunchies are usually the easiest to wash. These materials are durable. They can withstand most washing machine cycles without issue. I often throw my cotton scrunchies right into a mesh bag with similar colors. These fabrics hold up well against normal wear and tear. They also tolerate water and mild detergents very well. Most everyday scrunchies fall into this category.

### Silk and Satin Scrunchies

Silk and satin scrunchies are more delicate. These fabrics are known for their smooth texture and gentle feel on hair. However, they can snag or get damaged easily in a washing machine. High heat can also cause them to shrink or lose their luster. I recommend extreme caution with these. A gentle cycle with cold water is essential if you choose machine washing. Often, hand washing is the safest option for silk and satin.

### Velvet and Chenille Scrunchies

Velvet and chenille scrunchies have a soft, plush texture. These fabrics can be tricky to wash. Machine washing might flatten their pile or alter their texture. They can also attract lint easily. If machine washing, turn them inside out. Use a laundry bag to protect the surface. Cold water and a very gentle cycle are a must. Avoid harsh scrubbing or twisting.

### Embellished or Delicate Scrunchies

Some scrunchies have beads, sequins, charms, or other decorations. These embellishments make them unique but also more fragile. Machine washing can cause these parts to break off or get tangled. The delicate parts might also damage other items in the wash. If a scrunchie has any fragile embellishments, I always hand wash it. This prevents damage to the scrunchie and protects my washing machine from loose pieces. Always prioritize careful handling for these items.

## Preparing Scrunchies for Machine Washing: Essential Steps

Proper preparation makes a big difference when you put a scrunchie in the washing machine. It helps protect the scrunchie and ensures a better clean. I have learned a few tricks over the years. These steps are simple but very effective.

### Pre-Treatment for Stains

Before washing, check your scrunchies for any visible stains. Hair oil, makeup, or food can leave marks. If you find a stain, pre-treat it. Apply a small amount of mild stain remover or laundry detergent directly onto the spot. Gently rub the fabric with your fingers or a soft brush. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. This helps lift the stain before the main wash cycle. Do not use harsh chemicals, especially on delicate fabrics.

### Using a Mesh Laundry Bag

This step is critical for machine washing scrunchies. A mesh laundry bag acts as a protective barrier. It keeps scrunchies from getting tangled around other clothes. It also prevents them from stretching or losing their shape. Small items like scrunchies can even get lost in the washing machine drum. I always put all my scrunchies into a mesh bag. This simple tool saves my scrunchies from harm. It also prevents them from getting stuck in the machine's filter or drain.

### Separating Colors and Fabrics

Just like with other laundry, sort your scrunchies by color. Dark scrunchies can bleed dye onto lighter ones. Wash darks with darks, and lights with lights. This prevents color transfer. Also, consider separating different fabric types if you are washing a large batch. For example, wash sturdy cotton scrunchies with other sturdy items. Keep delicate silk scrunchies in their own separate bag or with other very delicate items. This prevents damage from friction during the wash. Proper sorting helps maintain the integrity of each scrunchie.

## The Best Washing Machine Settings for Scrunchies

Choosing the correct washing machine settings is vital for cleaning scrunchies effectively without damage. You want a gentle wash to protect delicate fabrics and elastics. I always pay close attention to these settings. They make all the difference in the outcome of my laundry. Understanding [what is a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-a-washing-machine) and its various cycles helps you choose wisely.

### Gentle Cycle or Delicate Setting

For most scrunchies, the "Gentle" or "Delicate" cycle is the best choice. These cycles use slower agitation speeds. They also have shorter wash times. This reduces stress on the scrunchie fabric and elastic. Standard or heavy-duty cycles are too harsh for scrunchies. They can cause stretching, tearing, or loss of shape. I never use a regular cycle for my scrunchies. The gentle action protects the material.

### Cold Water is Key

Always use cold water when washing scrunchies. Hot water can cause several problems. It can make colors bleed, especially on new or brightly colored scrunchies. Hot water can also shrink certain fabrics, like silk or cotton. It can weaken the elastic inside the scrunchie. Cold water is much gentler. It cleans effectively without posing these risks. Using cold water also saves energy, which is a nice bonus.

### Mild Detergent Choices

A mild laundry detergent is ideal for scrunchies. Harsh detergents can damage delicate fibers. They can also leave residue that makes scrunchies feel stiff. Look for detergents labeled "delicate" or "free and clear." Use only a small amount. Too much detergent creates excessive suds. It can also be hard to rinse out completely. I prefer liquid detergents over powders for delicate items. They dissolve better and leave less residue. Always measure your detergent carefully.

### Loading the Machine Properly

When you put a scrunchie in the washing machine, avoid overloading it. Overloading means there is not enough room for items to move freely. This can lead to improper cleaning and potential damage. For small, delicate items like scrunchies in a mesh bag, ensure they have space. The washing machine needs room to agitate properly. This applies whether you are washing a few scrunchies or a whole load. Understanding [how full a washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be) helps ensure everything gets clean. For delicate items, a less full load is often better.

## Drying Your Scrunchies Safely After Washing

Proper drying is just as important as proper washing for your scrunchies. High heat and rough handling during drying can cause irreversible damage. You want to maintain their shape, elasticity, and fabric quality. I have found that patience is key in this stage.

### Air Drying is Best

Air drying is by far the safest method for scrunchies. After washing, gently squeeze out excess water. Do not twist or wring them harshly. Lay them flat on a clean towel or hang them on a drying rack. You can also hang them individually on clothespins if they are sturdy. Ensure good air circulation. This helps them dry faster and prevents musty odors. Air drying helps preserve the fabric and the elastic. It also prevents shrinking.

### Avoiding the Dryer

I strongly advise against putting scrunchies in a tumble dryer. The high heat of a dryer is detrimental to most scrunchie materials.
*   **Elastic Damage:** Heat can break down the elastic core. This makes the scrunchie lose its stretch and ability to hold hair.
*   **Fabric Shrinkage:** Many fabrics, especially cotton and silk, can shrink significantly in a dryer.
*   **Material Damage:** Delicate fabrics like velvet or satin can get flattened or lose their sheen. Embellishments can also melt or break off.
*   **Snagging Risk:** Scrunchies can get caught on other items or inside the dryer drum. This can cause tears or snags.
Even a low-heat setting is often too risky. Stick to air drying for the best results.

### Reshaping and Storage

Once your scrunchies are completely dry, take a moment to reshape them. Gently stretch them back into their original form if needed. Store them in a clean, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight, which can fade colors over time. A drawer, a scrunchie holder, or a decorative box works well. Proper storage helps them stay clean and ready for use. It also helps them retain their shape until the next time you need them.

## When to Opt for Hand Washing Scrunchies Instead

While you can put a scrunchie in the washing machine, sometimes hand washing is the better choice. I choose hand washing for specific types of scrunchies. It offers a gentler approach and more control. This method ensures maximum protection for your most treasured hair accessories.

### Very Delicate Fabrics

Some scrunchies are made from extremely delicate materials. Raw silk, chiffon, or lace are examples. These fabrics can easily snag, tear, or lose their shape in a washing machine, even on a gentle cycle. The constant tumbling action is too harsh. For these, hand washing is the safest way to clean them. It allows you to control the agitation and water temperature precisely. This minimizes stress on the fibers.

### Heavily Embellished Scrunchies

Scrunchies with a lot of decorative elements require extra care. Beads, pearls, sequins, or intricate embroidery can detach in a machine wash. The force of the wash can also damage these embellishments. They can break or get pulled off. Hand washing lets you clean around these details gently. You can avoid direct rubbing or scrubbing on the decorated areas. This preserves the look of the scrunchie.

### Quick Spot Cleaning

For minor stains or a quick refresh, hand washing is more efficient than a full machine cycle. You might only need to clean a small area. For example, if you get a tiny bit of makeup on a scrunchie.
*   **Steps for Spot Cleaning:**
    1.  Dampen a clean cloth with cold water.
    2.  Add a tiny drop of mild detergent to the cloth.
    3.  Gently dab the stained area on the scrunchie. Do not rub vigorously.
    4.  Rinse the spot by dabbing with a separate damp cloth, ensuring all soap is removed.
    5.  Allow the scrunchie to air dry completely.
This method targets the specific dirty area. It avoids unnecessary wear and tear on the entire scrunchie. It's also much faster if you only have one or two scrunchies to clean.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Washing Scrunchies

Even with good intentions, mistakes can happen when washing scrunchies. Knowing these common pitfalls helps you prevent damage. I have learned from my own experiences. Avoiding these errors ensures your scrunchies stay in top condition.

### Overloading the Machine

Putting too many items into your washing machine is a frequent mistake. When you overload, scrunchies cannot move freely. This means they do not get properly cleaned. The elastic can also stretch out more easily. Overloading also increases friction between items. This leads to more wear and tear on delicate fabrics. Always give your laundry, especially items in mesh bags, enough space to tumble and rinse. This ensures every item gets adequate washing and rinsing.

### Using Harsh Chemicals

Strong bleaches or harsh detergents are bad for scrunchies. These chemicals can strip colors from fabric. They can also break down delicate fibers. This weakens the scrunchie over time. Harsh chemicals might also leave a residue. This makes the scrunchie stiff or irritating against your skin or hair. Always opt for mild, color-safe detergents. If you need to treat a tough stain, choose a gentle stain remover. Test it on an inconspicuous area first.

### High Heat Drying

As I mentioned, high heat is the enemy of most scrunchies. Tossing them in the dryer on a hot setting causes several issues.
*   **Elastic Degradation:** The heat melts or damages the elastic core. The scrunchie loses its stretch and becomes useless.
*   **Fabric Shrinkage:** Many fabrics will shrink, especially cotton and silk. This distorts the scrunchie's shape.
*   **Embellishment Damage:** Any glued-on decorations can melt or fall off due to high heat.
Always air dry your scrunchies. It is the gentlest and safest method. It extends their lifespan significantly.

### Not Using a Laundry Bag

Skipping the mesh laundry bag is a mistake that can lead to lost or damaged scrunchies. Scrunchies are small. They can slip out of the machine drum. They can also get tangled around other clothes. The elastic can snag on zippers or buttons of other garments. A laundry bag keeps them contained and protected. It prevents them from stretching or getting caught. It is a simple tool but offers huge protection.

## Maintaining Your Washing Machine for Delicate Items

A clean and well-maintained washing machine is important for all your laundry, especially delicate items like scrunchies. When your machine is clean, your clothes get cleaner. It also prevents potential damage or residue transfer. I regularly perform maintenance on my washing machine. It makes a big difference.

### Regular Cleaning of the Drum

The washing machine drum can accumulate residue from detergents, fabric softeners, and dirt from clothes. This residue can transfer to delicate items. It can also cause unpleasant odors. I clean my washing machine drum once a month.
*   **How to clean the drum:**
    1.  Run a hot water cycle with two cups of white vinegar.
    2.  After the vinegar cycle, run another hot water cycle with half a cup of baking soda.
    3.  Wipe down the drum and rubber seal with a damp cloth.
This simple routine keeps the drum fresh. It ensures no unwanted particles or smells transfer to your clean scrunchies.

### Checking the Filter

Washing machines have filters that catch lint, hair, and small objects. If you put a scrunchie in the washing machine without a mesh bag, it could end up in the filter. A clogged filter reduces the machine's efficiency. It can also cause draining issues. I make it a point to check and clean the filter regularly. Learning [how to clean the washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter) is easy. Most manufacturers provide instructions in the user manual. A clean filter ensures smooth operation and better cleaning results for all your laundry. A blocked filter can also trap small items. This prevents them from being properly rinsed.

### Proper Detergent Usage

Using the right amount of detergent is crucial. Too much detergent creates excessive suds. These suds are hard to rinse away completely. Residue can then build up on your clothes and in the machine. This can leave scrunchies feeling stiff or looking dull. Too little detergent means items might not get clean. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for detergent amounts. This is especially true for high-efficiency (HE) machines. HE detergents are low-sudsing and designed for these machines. Proper detergent use protects both your clothes and your appliance.

### Avoiding Fabric Softeners on Certain Fabrics

Fabric softeners can leave a waxy buildup on certain fabrics. This buildup can reduce absorbency. It can also attract dirt. While fine for some items, I often avoid fabric softeners for scrunchies, especially those made of silk or velvet. The chemicals can alter the fabric's texture or sheen over time. If you want softness, a small amount of white vinegar in the rinse cycle works as a natural softener. It helps remove detergent residue. It leaves fabrics feeling soft without the waxy coating.
