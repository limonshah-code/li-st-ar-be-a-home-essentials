You can find more information about this at [why does my LG dryer have water in it](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-have-water-in-it). Your dryer also has a moisture sensor. Clean this sensor if clothes are not drying fully. It is often located near the lint trap. These simple troubleshooting steps can often fix minor issues. They help you decide if you need to dig deeper into internal repairs.

### LG Dryer Not Heating: Fixing the Warming Issue

A dryer that runs but does not produce heat is a common and frustrating problem. Several components can cause an LG dryer to stop heating. The most common culprits are the thermal fuse, the heating element, or the thermistor. It is important to diagnose the correct part. Replacing the wrong component wastes time and money.

First, check the thermal fuse. The thermal fuse is a safety device. It blows if the dryer overheats. This prevents a fire hazard. Once blown, it cannot be reset. You must replace it. The thermal fuse is usually located on the blower housing or heating element assembly. You can test it for continuity with a multimeter. A reading of infinity means the fuse is bad. Always replace a blown thermal fuse with an exact match for your LG model. Before replacing, ensure the dryer vent is clear. A clogged vent often causes the thermal fuse to blow due to restricted airflow.

Next, inspect the heating element. This component generates the heat for drying. Over time, the coils can break or burn out. You will need to remove the back panel of the dryer to access it. Visually inspect the element for any breaks or disconnections. You can also test the heating element with a multimeter for continuity. A good heating element will show a specific resistance reading. No resistance means the element is faulty. Replacing the heating element involves disconnecting wires and mounting screws. This is a common repair for LG dryers. Many dryer repair principles apply across brands. Learning how to replace similar parts can be beneficial. For instance, some heating element diagnostics may be similar to those covered in a general [Maytag dryer repair](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-repair-maytag-dryer) guide.

Finally, consider the thermistor. The thermistor monitors the dryer's temperature. It sends signals to the control board. If the thermistor gives inaccurate readings, the dryer may not heat correctly. It might overheat or not heat at all. You can test the thermistor's resistance with a multimeter. The resistance value changes with temperature. Compare your readings to the service manual's specifications for your LG dryer model. If the thermistor is faulty, replacing it is usually straightforward. It involves unplugging the old one and plugging in a new one. These steps will help you restore heat to your LG dryer.

### When Your LG Dryer Won't Spin: Belt and Motor Fixes

If your LG dryer powers on but the drum does not spin, the issue likely involves the drive system. The main components to check are the drive belt, the idler pulley, and the drive motor. Each plays a critical role in turning the dryer drum. Diagnosing the correct part prevents unnecessary replacements.

The most common cause for a non-spinning drum is a broken drive belt. The drive belt wraps around the dryer drum, the motor pulley, and the idler pulley. Over time, the belt can wear out, fray, or snap. You might even find pieces of rubber inside the dryer cabinet. To check the belt, you usually need to remove the top and front panels of your LG dryer. Once the panels are off, you can visually inspect the belt. If it is broken, you will need to replace it. Replacing a dryer belt is a common repair task. The process is similar for many dryer brands. For example, the steps involved in replacing a [GE dryer belt](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-repair-ge-dryer-belt) offer transferable knowledge.

Next, examine the idler pulley. The idler pulley keeps tension on the drive belt. It allows the belt to turn the drum smoothly. If the idler pulley is seized, broken, or has a worn bearing, the belt cannot function correctly. This can prevent the drum from spinning. It can also cause squeaking noises. Check the pulley for smooth rotation. Ensure it does not wobble excessively. If the idler pulley is faulty, you will need to replace it. This involves removing the old pulley and installing a new one.

Finally, consider the drive motor. The drive motor spins the drum and powers the blower fan. If the motor fails, the drum will not spin. You might hear a humming sound from the motor if it is trying to start but cannot. This usually indicates a seized bearing or a faulty winding within the motor. A motor failure is a less common issue than a broken belt. However, it is a more complex and expensive repair. You can test the motor with a multimeter if you suspect it is faulty. Replacing the motor requires significant disassembly of the dryer. It is often best left to a professional if you are not comfortable with extensive appliance repair. However, knowing how to use your LG dryer can also provide insight into its normal operation, which helps in identifying abnormal behavior. You can refer to articles like [how to use the LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-the-lg-dryer) for basic operational understanding.

### Addressing LG Dryer Noise and Vibration

Unusual noises or excessive vibrations from your LG dryer indicate a mechanical problem. These issues often worsen over time. Addressing them early can prevent more severe damage. Common sources of noise include worn drum rollers, a faulty idler pulley, or a damaged blower wheel.

Drum rollers support the dryer drum. They allow it to spin smoothly. Over time, the rollers can wear out. Their bearings can become stiff or noisy. When this happens, you might hear thumping, squealing, or grinding sounds. To check the drum rollers, you need to access the dryer drum. Remove the front panel and the drum itself. Inspect each roller for flat spots, cracks, or excessive play. If any roller shows signs of wear, replace all of them. Replacing all rollers ensures even support for the drum. It prolongs the life of your repair.

The idler pulley, as mentioned before, maintains tension on the drive belt. If its bearing wears out, it can produce a high-pitched squealing or chirping noise. You can often pinpoint this sound by spinning the pulley by hand after the dryer's power is off. If it feels rough or makes noise, replace it. This is a relatively simple repair. It involves releasing the belt tension and unbolting the old pulley.

A damaged blower wheel can also cause loud noises. The blower wheel moves air through the dryer. It is usually located at the back of the dryer behind the drum. If an object gets into the blower housing, or if the wheel itself cracks, it can create a loud thumping or grinding sound. You might need to remove the back panel or even the front bulk head to access the blower wheel. Inspect the fan blades for damage or obstructions. Clear any debris. If the wheel is cracked or broken, you must replace it. Ensure the new blower wheel is securely fastened to the motor shaft. Addressing these noise sources will restore your LG dryer's quiet operation.

### LG Dryer Error Codes: Understanding and Resolving Alerts

Modern LG dryers use digital displays to show error codes. These codes help diagnose problems quickly. When your dryer shows a code, it is trying to tell you what is wrong. Common codes point to issues with airflow, temperature, or motor function. Always check your dryer's owner's manual first. The manual provides specific meanings for each code.

Some common LG dryer error codes include:

*   **D80, D90, D95:** These codes relate to exhaust system blockages. They indicate restricted airflow, usually due to a clogged vent. A dirty lint trap can also cause these errors. You need to clean the lint screen thoroughly. Then, check the vent duct. Make sure it is not crushed, kinked, or filled with lint. Clearing the vent system is crucial. It prevents overheating and fire hazards. If your LG dryer shows water-related codes or has excess water, this can sometimes be linked to drainage or air circulation issues. For specifics on handling water, consider referencing guides on [how to empty water from an LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-empty-water-lg-dryer).
