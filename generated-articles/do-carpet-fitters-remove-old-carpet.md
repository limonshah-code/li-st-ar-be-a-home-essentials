## The Cost of Old Carpet Removal by Fitters

The cost to remove old carpet varies. Several factors influence the price. Room size is a big one. A larger room means more work. It means more material to remove. The type of old carpet also matters. Some carpets are harder to lift than others.

Another factor is the existing underlay. Removing old underlay adds to the work. Access to the room also plays a role. If it is hard to move materials, costs can go up. Disposal fees also affect the price. These fees cover taking the old carpet to a waste facility.

Prices can range from a small per-square-meter charge. It can also be a flat fee per room. Always ask for a detailed quote. This quote should break down the costs. It should show the fitting cost separately from the removal cost.

### Factors Affecting Removal Cost

Many things change the price of old carpet removal. The area of the room is key. Larger spaces take more time. They also produce more waste. The condition of the old carpet matters too. If it is glued down, removal is harder. This increases labor time.
