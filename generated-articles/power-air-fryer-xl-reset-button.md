A quick reset can often bring it back to normal operation without needing a repair. It is always the first troubleshooting step I recommend.

### Common Signs a Reset Is Needed

Your Power Air Fryer XL can give you clues that it needs a reset. One major sign is if the unit does not power on. You might press the power button, but nothing happens. This can be frustrating, but a reset often helps. If your air fryer remains unresponsive, it is a clear signal to try a reset.

Another common problem occurs when the air fryer heats up improperly. You set a temperature, but the food cooks too slowly or not at all. This suggests a problem with the heating element or its controls. A reset can sometimes re-calibrate these internal settings.
