### Why does my window air conditioner run but not cool?

Your window air conditioner runs but does not cool because of issues like a dirty air filter, frozen evaporator coils, a refrigerant leak, or a faulty compressor. These problems prevent the unit from properly removing heat from your home and releasing cool air. Simple maintenance often fixes the problem, but some issues need professional repair.

## Check Basic Settings and Power Supply Issues

Before diving into complex diagnostics, it is wise to check the simplest things first. Sometimes, the solution is easier than you think. Your window air conditioner might not be cooling simply because of an incorrect setting or a power issue.

First, verify the mode setting. Many window AC units have multiple modes, such as "Cool," "Fan Only," and "Dry" (dehumidify). If your unit is set to "Fan Only," it will circulate air but will not cool it. Ensure the mode is set to "Cool." Also, check the temperature setting. If the thermostat is set higher than your room's current temperature, the compressor will not activate. Lower the temperature setting significantly to see if it triggers the cooling cycle.

Next, consider the power supply. A window AC unit needs consistent power. Check if the unit is fully plugged into a working outlet. Sometimes, a loose plug can prevent the compressor from engaging fully. If your unit is on a circuit with other high-power appliances, the circuit breaker might have tripped. Go to your home's electrical panel and check for any tripped breakers. Flip it back to the "On" position if you find one. These basic checks often resolve the problem quickly, saving you time and effort on more involved troubleshooting.

## Clogged Filters and Dirty Coils: Major Cooling Impediments

A common reason your window air conditioner is running but not cooling the house is a dirty air filter. The air filter traps dust, pet dander, and other particles from the air. Over time, this filter becomes clogged. A clogged filter blocks airflow over the evaporator coils. This reduced airflow makes the unit work harder without actually cooling the air. It also prevents the coils from absorbing heat effectively. You might notice the fan blowing, but the air feels weak or warm.

Cleaning your air filter is a simple and quick fix. Most window AC units have a washable filter located behind the front grille. Remove the filter and rinse it under cool water until it runs clear. Let it dry completely before putting it back. Experts recommend cleaning your window AC filter every two to four weeks, especially during heavy use. Regular cleaning not only improves cooling efficiency but also extends the life of your unit. For detailed steps on keeping your filter clean, you can learn [how to clean an air conditioner filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-conditioner-filter).

Beyond the filter, the coils themselves can get dirty. Your window AC has two main sets of coils: the evaporator coils inside your home and the condenser coils outside. The evaporator coils absorb heat from your room. If these coils are covered in dirt and grime, they cannot absorb heat efficiently. This can lead to a phenomenon called "frozen coils." The moisture in the air freezes on the dirty coils because heat cannot transfer away. When coils freeze, airflow stops almost completely, and the unit blows no cool air. Dirty condenser coils on the outside also cause problems. They release heat from your home to the outside air. If they are dirty, they cannot dissipate heat effectively, making the whole system less efficient. For comprehensive cleaning instructions for your coils, learn [how to clean air conditioner coils](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-conditioner-coils). Keeping both filters and coils clean is a crucial part of routine air conditioner maintenance.

## Understanding Refrigerant Leaks and Frozen Evaporator Coils

A significant reason your window air conditioner runs but fails to cool is a low refrigerant level. Refrigerant, often called Freon, is the chemical compound that absorbs heat from your indoor air and releases it outside. It cycles through the AC system, changing from a liquid to a gas and back again. If your unit has a refrigerant leak, it means there is not enough refrigerant to properly absorb and transport heat. The air conditioner's fan will still run, and you might even hear the compressor humming, but the cooling process will be severely hampered or stop entirely.

Symptoms of a refrigerant leak often include weak or warm air coming from the vents. You might also hear a bubbling or hissing sound coming from the unit, which indicates refrigerant escaping. Another common sign is the evaporator coil freezing over. When refrigerant levels are low, the pressure inside the system drops. This causes the remaining refrigerant to get too cold, leading to ice forming on the evaporator coils. This ice buildup then blocks airflow, making the cooling even worse. If you notice ice on your coils, turn off the AC and let it thaw completely. Then, check for a possible refrigerant leak.

Fixing a refrigerant leak is not a DIY task. It requires a certified HVAC technician. They use specialized tools to detect leaks, repair the source, and then recharge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. It is illegal and dangerous to simply add more refrigerant without finding and fixing the leak. Continuing to run an AC with low refrigerant can damage the compressor, leading to a much more expensive repair. If your window air conditioner is not as cold as it used to be and you suspect a refrigerant issue, seeking professional help is the safest and most effective solution.

## Compressor and Capacitor Problems: The Core of Cooling Issues

The compressor is the heart of your window air conditioner's cooling system. Its job is to compress the refrigerant gas, increasing its temperature and pressure so it can release heat to the outside. If the compressor fails, your AC unit will simply not cool the air, even though the fan might still be running. You might hear a distinct humming sound but no actual cooling. Sometimes, the compressor attempts to start but quickly shuts off. This suggests a problem with its operation.

The capacitors are small, cylindrical components that provide the initial electrical boost to start the compressor motor and keep it running efficiently. There are usually two types: a start capacitor and a run capacitor. If either of these capacitors fails, the compressor might not start at all, or it might struggle to run. A faulty start capacitor might result in a loud click or hum, but the compressor never kicks in. A failing run capacitor can cause the compressor to overheat or run inefficiently, leading to poor cooling performance. You might hear a dull humming or clicking sound before the unit goes silent.

Diagnosing and replacing a compressor or capacitor is generally a job for a professional. These components deal with high voltage electricity. Incorrect handling can lead to electrical shock or further damage to the unit. A qualified technician can test the capacitors and compressor to determine if they are faulty. They have the specialized tools and expertise needed to safely replace these parts. While replacing these components can be expensive, it is often more cost-effective than buying a brand-new unit, especially if your window AC is relatively new. Trusting this repair to an expert ensures the job is done correctly and safely, restoring your air conditioner's cooling power.

## Clogged Drain Line and Water Leakage Issues

Your window air conditioner removes humidity from the air as part of the cooling process. This moisture condenses on the evaporator coils and collects in a drip pan. From the drip pan, it should flow out through a drain line to the outside. If this drain line becomes clogged, water will back up in the drip pan. Common culprits for clogs include algae, mold, dirt, or insect nests. When the water has nowhere to go, it can overflow from the drip pan.

An overflowing drip pan can cause several problems beyond just water leaking into your home. The standing water can lead to increased humidity indoors, making your home feel muggy even if the air is somewhat cool. More importantly, excess water can damage electrical components within the unit, leading to complete system failure. Some modern units have a safety float switch that shuts down the compressor if the water level in the drip pan gets too high. In this case, the fan might still run, but the cooling will stop.

To address a clogged drain line, you can often clear it yourself. First, unplug the unit for safety. Locate the drain pan and the drain hole or tube. You can try to clear minor clogs using a stiff wire or a small brush. Sometimes, a mixture of vinegar and water poured into the drain pan can help break down algae and mold. If you see visible mold inside the unit, it is crucial to clean it thoroughly. For guidance on cleaning specific components and preventing mold, refer to articles like [how to clean mold from window air conditioner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-window-air-conditioner) and [how to clean air conditioner drain line](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-conditioner-drain-line). Regular inspection and cleaning of the drain line prevent water damage and maintain efficient cooling performance.

## Air Leaks and Poor Insulation: External Factors Affecting Cooling

Even if your window air conditioner is working perfectly, external factors can prevent it from cooling your house effectively. The most common issue is air leaks around the unit itself. Window AC units are installed in an opening, and often, small gaps remain between the unit and the window frame. Warm air from outside can seep into your home through these gaps. At the same time, cool air from inside your home can escape. This constant exchange makes your AC work harder than it should, struggling to maintain the set temperature. You might feel the fan blowing cool air directly from the unit, but the room itself does not get cool.

To check for air leaks, simply feel around the edges of the window unit when it is running. You might detect drafts of warm air entering or cool air escaping. Weatherstripping, foam insulation strips, or even duct tape can effectively seal these gaps. Many window AC units come with side panels that extend to fill the window opening. Ensure these panels are fully extended and sealed properly. You can also use expanding foam sealant for larger, more permanent gaps, but be careful as it can be difficult to remove.

Beyond the unit itself, overall home insulation plays a big role. Poor window seals in other windows, cracks around doors, or insufficient insulation in walls and attics can allow heat to penetrate your home. This means your AC is fighting a losing battle against heat gain. While sealing the AC unit's immediate surroundings is a quick fix, improving your home's overall insulation can significantly enhance your window AC's performance and reduce energy bills. Consider these factors if your AC is running continuously but still failing to cool the entire space.

## When to Call a Professional for Your Window AC

While many window air conditioner problems are solvable with basic DIY maintenance, some issues demand professional expertise. Knowing when to call a technician saves you time, prevents further damage, and ensures your safety. If you have tried all the basic troubleshooting steps—cleaning filters and coils, checking settings, and sealing leaks—and your unit still refuses to cool, it is likely time to involve an expert.

Complex electrical issues are one such instance. Problems with the compressor, its capacitors, or the control board are intricate. They often require specialized diagnostic tools to pinpoint the exact fault. Attempting to repair these high-voltage components without proper training can be dangerous, leading to electrical shock. Refrigerant leaks also fall into this category. Handling refrigerants without certification is illegal due to environmental regulations. Furthermore, proper repair and recharging of a system require precise measurements and specialized equipment that homeowners typically do not possess.

Another sign to call a professional is unusual noises or smells coming from the unit. A grinding, banging, or screeching sound could indicate a failing motor or compressor. A burning smell suggests an electrical problem. These symptoms point to serious internal issues that need immediate attention from a qualified technician. A professional can diagnose the root cause of the cooling problem, perform safe and effective repairs, and ensure your unit operates efficiently. Investing in a professional repair can often extend the life of your unit, making it a cost-effective choice compared to immediate replacement, especially for newer units. For more complex AC issues, a professional can provide the right solution, as detailed in general air conditioner troubleshooting guides.
