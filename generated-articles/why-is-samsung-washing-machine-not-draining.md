Your Samsung washing machine is not draining typically because of a clog. This clog is often in the drain pump filter or the drain hose. Other reasons include a faulty drain pump or issues with the lid switch, door lock, or control board. Addressing these common areas helps fix the problem.

## Common Drain Pump Issues in Samsung Washers

One of the most frequent reasons your Samsung washing machine is not draining is a problem with the drain pump. The drain pump is responsible for pushing water out of the drum. If this pump cannot do its job, water stays inside. This happens when the pump gets clogged. Small items like coins, lint, or socks can enter the pump filter. This blocks the water flow. A faulty pump motor also prevents draining. It might hum but not move water.

Inspecting the drain pump filter should be your first step. Most Samsung washers have a small access panel near the bottom front. You can open this panel to find the filter. Place a towel down before opening it. Some water will likely come out. Twist the filter counter-clockwise to remove it. Carefully clean any debris you find. Rinse the filter under running water. Then, put it back in place. This simple cleaning often solves the drain problem. Regular cleaning prevents future clogs.

### Inspecting the Drain Pump Filter

Your Samsung washing machine has a filter designed to catch debris. This filter protects the drain pump. Over time, lint, hair, coins, or small objects collect in it. A blocked filter stops the machine from draining water. This is a very common cause of draining problems.

Locating the filter is usually straightforward. It is often behind a small access door at the bottom front of your washing machine. You might need a flat-head screwdriver to open the door. Before opening the filter, prepare for some water to spill out. Place a shallow pan and towels on the floor. Slowly twist the filter counter-clockwise to remove it. Clean off any debris from the filter screen. You can use an old toothbrush to help scrub it. Check the filter housing for any blockages as well. Make sure the impeller inside the pump spins freely. Once clean, insert the filter and twist it clockwise until it is tight. Run a test cycle to check for proper drainage. For top-loader models, the filter might be in a different location. Check your user manual for the exact steps to access it. Learn more about how to clean your top-loader's filter specifically.

### Testing the Drain Pump

If cleaning the filter does not fix the problem, the drain pump itself might be faulty. A drain pump motor can wear out or burn up. You can perform a simple test to check it. First, disconnect power to the washing machine for safety. Access the drain pump again. You might need to tilt the machine or remove the front panel. Locate the wires connected to the drain pump motor. Use a multimeter to test for continuity. No continuity indicates an open circuit, meaning the motor is bad.

Another way to test is to try to manually activate the pump. This is more advanced and requires caution. Some technicians apply direct voltage to the pump motor leads. If the pump runs, the issue is electrical or with the control board. If it does not run, the pump is likely the problem. Replacing a drain pump can be a DIY task for many. However, if you are unsure, calling a qualified technician is safer. A faulty drain pump often needs replacement.

## Clogged or Kinked Drain Hose

A common and easy-to-fix reason your Samsung washing machine is not draining is a problem with the drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the washer to your standpipe or laundry tub. If this hose is kinked, bent, or clogged, water cannot flow out. This simple issue often gets overlooked. It creates the same problem as a faulty pump.

You should check the entire length of the drain hose. Look behind the washing machine. Make sure the hose is not sharply bent or squashed against a wall. The hose should have a gentle curve. It must not have any tight kinks. Also, check where the hose connects to your standpipe or sink. The connection point itself can become blocked. Lint and soap scum build up over time. This narrows the opening. This blockage prevents water from escaping. Make sure the hose is not pushed too far down into the standpipe. This can create a siphon effect and cause issues. Problems with hoses are common across brands. You might find similar troubleshooting steps useful for other appliances. For example, issues with a [Kenmore washing machine not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-washing-machine-not-draining) could also be due to a blocked hose.

### Checking the Drain Hose for Obstructions

The drain hose can get clogged with various items. Lint, socks, or even small clothing items can get stuck inside. These obstructions block the water flow. To check for a clog, you need to disconnect the drain hose. First, pull the washing machine away from the wall. Turn off the water supply to the machine. Disconnect the drain hose from the standpipe or sink. Have a bucket ready. Any remaining water in the hose will spill out. Visually inspect both ends of the hose.

You can use a flashlight to look inside the hose. If you see an obstruction, try to pull it out with pliers or push it through with a long, flexible brush. A plumber's snake can also work. Once you clear the hose, reattach it securely. Ensure there are no kinks when you push the machine back into place. Run a small test cycle to confirm proper drainage. Fixing this can be a quick and free solution. Other washing machines face similar issues. For instance, you can find solutions for [LG washing machine not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-washing-machine-not-draining) that are comparable to these steps.

### Proper Hose Installation

Correct installation of the drain hose prevents many drainage problems. The hose should not be too long or too short. An excessively long hose can create sagging areas where water collects. This promotes clogs. A hose that is too short can be kinked easily when moving the machine. The drain hose should form an "air gap" at the standpipe or sink. This prevents dirty water from siphoning back into your washing machine. Most manuals suggest securing the hose with a U-shaped bracket.

The end of the drain hose should be above the water level in the standpipe. It should not be pushed too far down. Manufacturers specify a minimum and maximum height for the drain hose. Refer to your Samsung washing machine's user manual for these exact measurements. Following these guidelines helps ensure efficient water drainage. It reduces the chance of clogs and siphoning issues. Proper installation makes a big difference in appliance performance.

## Understanding Samsung Washing Machine Error Codes

When your Samsung washing machine is not draining, it often displays an error code. These codes are helpful diagnostic tools. They tell you what problem the machine has detected. Common error codes related to draining issues include "ND" (No Drain), "5E", "5C", or "OE" (Overflow Error). Each code points to a specific issue. Knowing what these codes mean saves you time and effort. It helps you pinpoint the exact cause of the problem.

Your user manual provides a complete list of error codes and their meanings. If you do not have the manual, you can often find it online. Just search for your Samsung washing machine model number. Once you identify the code, you can follow the recommended troubleshooting steps. Sometimes, simply resetting the machine clears a temporary glitch. Other times, the code indicates a physical problem needing attention. Pay close attention to the display when a drain issue occurs.

### Common Drain-Related Error Codes

Several error codes indicate your Samsung washing machine has a draining problem.
*   **"ND" (No Drain) or "5E" / "5C":** These codes directly mean the machine cannot drain water. This usually points to a clogged drain pump filter, a kinked drain hose, or a faulty drain pump. This is the most direct indicator of a drain issue.
*   **"OE" (Overflow Error):** This code means the machine has detected too much water. This happens if the water level sensor is faulty. It also occurs if the water valve is stuck open. The machine cannot drain if it believes there is an overflow. This often triggers a drain attempt, which then fails.
*   **"LE" (Leak Error):** While not directly about draining, a leak could impact the ability to drain. If water is escaping somewhere, the machine might struggle to maintain the correct level. It might also trip safety sensors.
*   **"Ub" / "UE" (Unbalance Error):** An unbalanced load can prevent the machine from spinning. The machine needs to drain water before it spins properly. If it cannot spin, it might also struggle to complete the drain cycle. This might seem unrelated, but proper balance is critical for the final stages of a wash.

Understanding these codes helps you narrow down the issue quickly. They guide your troubleshooting efforts.

### Resetting Your Samsung Washing Machine

Sometimes, an error code or drainage problem is due to a temporary glitch. Resetting your Samsung washing machine can clear these minor issues. This is often the first thing customer support will ask you to do. The process is simple and takes only a few minutes. First, unplug the washing machine from the power outlet. Wait for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the internal computer to fully discharge and reset.

After waiting, plug the washing machine back into the outlet. Turn the machine on. Try running a drain or spin cycle to see if the problem is resolved. If the error code reappears, or if the machine still does not drain, the issue is likely mechanical or electrical. This means a part might be faulty. A reset is a good first step, but it will not fix a physical blockage or a broken component.

## Malfunctioning Lid Switch or Door Lock

For top-load Samsung washing machines, a lid switch detects if the lid is closed. For front-load models, a door lock mechanism ensures the door is securely shut. Both of these are safety features. The washing machine will not drain or spin if it thinks the lid or door is open. This prevents water from spilling out and stops hands from getting caught. A faulty lid switch or door lock sends a signal to the control board. It tells the machine the door is open, even if it is closed. This prevents the cycle from completing.

If your Samsung washing machine is not draining and also not spinning, check this component. It is a common culprit. The switch or lock can wear out over time. It can also get damaged. Sometimes, debris can prevent the door from closing completely. This stops the switch from engaging. Ensuring the door closes properly is crucial. A light click often signals proper engagement.

### Testing the Lid Switch

A faulty lid switch is a common cause for a top-load Samsung washing machine not draining or spinning. The lid switch is typically located under the washer's main top. It has a small arm that gets depressed when the lid closes. This sends a signal to the control board. You can test the lid switch for continuity using a multimeter. First, unplug the washer for safety. Locate the lid switch. It usually has two wires connected to it. Disconnect the wires.

Place the multimeter probes on the switch terminals. The meter should show continuity when the lid is closed (or the switch arm is depressed). It should show no continuity when the lid is open. If the switch does not show continuity when closed, it is faulty. It needs replacement. This test helps confirm if the switch is sending the correct signal. If it sends no signal, the machine remains in a "door open" state. This stops the drain and spin cycles.

### Inspecting the Door Lock Mechanism

For front-load Samsung washing machines, the door lock mechanism is critical. This part keeps the door securely shut during operation. It also communicates to the control board that the door is locked. If the door lock is faulty, the machine will not proceed with the drain or spin cycle. It thinks the door is open. Sometimes, you might hear a clicking sound when you try to start a cycle, but the door does not fully lock.

First, check the door for any visible damage. Ensure nothing is caught in the latch. Examine the strike on the door that fits into the lock. Sometimes, clothes can get wedged, preventing proper closure. You can also visually inspect the door lock assembly itself. It is usually located around the door frame. If the door lock is physically broken, it will need replacement. Electrical issues with the lock can also occur. A multimeter can test for continuity in the lock's electrical circuit. If your Samsung washing machine door will not unlock, this mechanism might be stuck or broken. You can find steps on [how to get Samsung washing machine to unlock](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-samsung-washing-machine-to-unlock) that might help diagnose or bypass a stuck lock.

## Issues with the Water Level Sensor or Pressure Switch

Your Samsung washing machine uses a water level sensor, also known as a pressure switch. This component measures the amount of water in the drum. It tells the control board when the correct water level is reached for washing and when the water is gone for draining. If this sensor malfunctions, it can give incorrect readings. The machine might think there is still water in the tub, even if it is empty. This prevents the drain cycle from activating fully. Conversely, it might sense no water when there is, causing other issues.

A common sign of a faulty water level sensor is the machine overfilling or underfilling. Another sign is when it starts a drain cycle, stops, and then reports a drain error. The sensor connects to the drum via a small air hose. This hose can become clogged. Debris or suds can block the air pressure from reaching the sensor. This provides inaccurate readings. Cleaning this hose can sometimes resolve the issue. If the sensor itself is faulty, it will need to be replaced.

### How the Water Level Sensor Works

The water level sensor, or pressure switch, is a key part of your Samsung washing machine's operation. It works by detecting air pressure changes. As water fills the drum, it pushes air through a small tube connected to the sensor. The sensor converts this air pressure into an electrical signal. This signal tells the control board how much water is in the tub. The control board uses this information for various steps. It knows when to stop filling. It also knows when to start draining.

If the air tube gets kinked or clogged, the sensor cannot get an accurate reading. This leads to problems like overfilling or failing to drain. For example, if the tube is blocked, the sensor might always read "empty." The machine would keep filling water. Or, it might read "full" even when the drum is empty. This stops the drain cycle. Understanding this helps you see why a small clog in this tube can cause big problems.

### Diagnosing a Faulty Pressure Switch

Diagnosing a faulty pressure switch involves a few steps. First, ensure the air tube connecting the pressure switch to the washing machine tub is clear. Disconnect the tube from both ends and blow through it to check for obstructions. A clogged tube often prevents the sensor from reading correctly. If the tube is clear, the pressure switch itself might be faulty.

You can test the switch with a multimeter for continuity, much like the lid switch. Most pressure switches have multiple terminals. They change continuity based on pressure. Without water pressure, certain terminals should show continuity. With simulated pressure (by blowing into the hose connection), the continuity should switch. Refer to your service manual for the specific pinout and expected readings. If the switch does not react as expected, it likely needs replacement. Replacing this part often restores normal draining functions.

## Electrical Problems and Control Board Failure

Electrical problems can certainly cause your Samsung washing machine not to drain. The drain pump needs power to operate. If there is no power reaching the pump, it will not run. This can be due to a tripped circuit breaker or a faulty outlet. Sometimes, the issue is more internal, like a loose wire connection within the machine. A more serious electrical problem involves the control board. The control board is the "brain" of your washing machine. It sends commands to all components, including the drain pump.

If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the signal to activate the drain pump. Or, it might send incorrect signals. Signs of a control board issue include erratic behavior, unresponsive buttons, or error codes that do not correspond to any obvious mechanical problem. Diagnosing control board issues is complex. It often requires a professional technician. However, checking basic electrical connections is a good first step for anyone.

### Power Supply Checks

Before assuming a major component failure, check your washing machine's power supply. First, confirm the washing machine is securely plugged into a working electrical outlet. Test the outlet by plugging in another small appliance. If the outlet works, check your home's circuit breaker box. A dedicated circuit breaker for your laundry area might have tripped. Reset the breaker by flipping it completely off, then back on.

Also, inspect the power cord itself for any visible damage. A frayed or cut cord can prevent power from reaching the machine. Sometimes, a general power surge can cause a temporary glitch. Unplugging the machine for a few minutes and then plugging it back in can reset its internal electronics. This simple power cycling often resolves minor electrical communication errors. Ensuring stable power is the foundation of any appliance troubleshooting.

### Signs of a Control Board Problem

A failing control board can manifest in several ways. These signs are often non-specific but can point to a deeper electronic issue. If your Samsung washing machine has a drain problem and you have ruled out clogs and pump issues, consider the control board.
*   **Intermittent Drainage Issues:** The machine drains some cycles but not others. This suggests inconsistent commands from the board.
*   **Random Error Codes:** The machine displays various error codes that do not seem to relate to a single issue. Or, it gives codes not listed in the manual.
*   **Unresponsive Buttons:** Buttons on the control panel do not work or work intermittently. This indicates a communication problem within the board.
*   **Cycle Stalling:** The wash cycle stops mid-way, often before the drain or spin cycle. It might just sit there with water in the tub.
*   **Machine Not Turning On:** If your [Samsung washing machine won't turn on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-samsung-washing-machine-turn-on) at all, the control board is a strong suspect. It controls all power initiation.

Replacing a control board is typically expensive. It often requires professional help. Make sure you have ruled out all other simpler causes first.

## Overflow and Suds Issues

Sometimes, your Samsung washing machine is not draining because of an overflow condition or excessive suds. These issues can prevent the drain cycle from starting or completing. An overflow occurs if the machine fills with too much water. This happens due to a faulty water level sensor or a stuck water inlet valve. When the machine senses an overflow, it might stop all operations, including draining, as a safety measure. It might also show an "OE" (Overflow Error) code.

Excessive suds, also known as a "suds lock," is another common problem. If you use too much detergent, especially high-efficiency (HE) detergent in a non-HE machine, it creates a lot of foam. This foam can confuse the water level sensor. The suds are airy and do not weigh as much as water. The sensor might read a lower water level than what is actually in the tub. This prevents the drain pump from activating. The pump might also struggle to move foamy water. The suds can also clog the drain line or pump.

### Preventing Suds Lock

Suds lock is a common issue that stops your washing machine from draining. It happens when you use too much detergent. The excess suds interfere with the machine's ability to sense the water level. They also create a thick foam that the drain pump struggles to push out. To prevent suds lock, always use the correct amount of detergent. Check your detergent's instructions. They usually provide guidance based on load size and water hardness.

Use only high-efficiency (HE) detergent in HE washing machines. These detergents produce very few suds. Traditional detergents create too much foam for HE washers. If you already have a suds lock, run a rinse and spin cycle without adding any detergent. This helps flush out the excess suds. You might need to do this a few times. Reducing the amount of detergent you use will protect your washing machine. It will also ensure proper drainage.

### Dealing with Overfilling

If your Samsung washing machine overfills, it will not drain properly. This issue often signals a problem with the water inlet valve or the water level sensor. The water inlet valve can stick open. This allows water to continuously flow into the drum. The water level sensor might malfunction. It could fail to tell the machine when the correct water level is reached. When the machine detects an overfill, it stops. This prevents a flood.

To deal with an overfilling machine, first, turn off the water supply to the washing machine. You will find two faucets behind the machine. Turn them both off. Then, unplug the machine from the power outlet. This stops the water flow and resets the machine. If the problem persists after turning the water back on, you likely have a faulty water inlet valve or water level sensor. These parts will need inspection or replacement. An overfilling issue can also lead to leaks from the bottom of your machine.
