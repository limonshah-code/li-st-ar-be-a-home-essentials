## Quick Guide: How to Drain Your Samsung Dishwasher

Discovering standing water in your Samsung dishwasher after a cycle is frustrating. It signals a problem with the drainage system. This common issue can leave dishes dirty and create unpleasant odors. You need a fast and effective way to remove the water.

Fortunately, many drainage problems with a Samsung dishwasher are simple to fix yourself. You do not always need a technician. I will walk you through the essential steps to troubleshoot and drain your Samsung dishwasher. We will cover everything from basic checks to clearing common clogs. This guide helps you identify the problem and apply the right solution. You will learn about cleaning filters, checking hoses, and inspecting external plumbing components. My goal is to help you get your dishwasher back to proper working order.

### Takeaway

If your Samsung dishwasher has standing water, follow these steps:

*   **Disconnect Power:** Always unplug the dishwasher first.
*   **Remove Standing Water:** Manually scoop out water.
*   **Clean Filter:** Remove and wash the dishwasher filter.
*   **Inspect Drain Hose:** Check for kinks or clogs in the hose.
*   **Clear Air Gap/Sink:** Ensure your air gap or garbage disposal is clear.
*   **Test Drain Pump:** Listen for the pump or check for debris.

To drain your Samsung dishwasher, first turn off its power at the breaker. Manually remove any standing water from the tub. Then, check and clean the filter assembly at the bottom of the dishwasher. Next, inspect the drain hose for kinks or blockages. Finally, ensure your sink drain or air gap is not clogged.

## Understanding Why Your Samsung Dishwasher Won't Drain

A Samsung dishwasher that will not drain often signals a blockage or a component malfunction. Identifying the cause is the first step in fixing the problem. I have seen many people overlook simple issues. These simple issues lead to bigger frustrations. Knowing the common culprits helps you address the problem efficiently.

The most frequent reason for standing water is a clogged filter. Food particles, grease, and debris accumulate in the filter over time. This buildup prevents water from flowing freely into the drain pump. A dirty filter is easy to check and clean. This is often the quickest fix.

Another common issue is a kinked or blocked drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. If the hose bends sharply or debris clogs it, water cannot exit. Checking the hose involves looking behind the dishwasher. You will need to make sure the hose runs freely without any tight bends.

Sometimes, the problem is not with the dishwasher itself. It could be your home's plumbing. A clogged sink drain or a faulty air gap can prevent proper drainage. The dishwasher uses these shared connections. A problem with them will affect dishwasher performance. It is important to check these external components too. Understanding these potential issues helps you approach the repair systematically. You can address the most likely causes first. This saves you time and effort. If your dishwasher does not drain, consider these common issues first. This article will help you address them step-by-step.
If you notice your dishwasher does not drain at all, it's often one of these simple problems. For more details on common reasons for drainage issues, see our guide on [when a dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/when-dishwasher-does-not-drain).

## Essential Safety Steps Before Draining Your Samsung Dishwasher

Before you start any work on your Samsung dishwasher, safety must be your top priority. You are dealing with water and electricity. Ignoring safety precautions can cause injury or damage to your appliance. I always ensure these steps are complete before I begin. This protects both me and the dishwasher.

First, disconnect the dishwasher from its power source. This is very important. You can unplug it from the wall outlet if it is accessible. If it is hardwired, you must turn off the circuit breaker that controls the dishwasher. Go to your home's main electrical panel. Find the breaker labeled for your dishwasher or kitchen. Flip it to the "off" position. This stops all electrical flow to the appliance. You prevent accidental shocks during your work.

Next, shut off the water supply to the dishwasher. There is usually a shut-off valve under your kitchen sink. This valve connects to the dishwasher's water intake line. Turn the handle clockwise until it is fully closed. This prevents any new water from entering the dishwasher while you work. You do not want water spilling out when you open things up.

Prepare your workspace by laying down old towels or rags. There might be residual water in the dishwasher tub or hoses. These towels will absorb any spills. Have a bucket or a large bowl ready too. You might need to scoop out standing water from the dishwasher tub. A wet/dry vacuum is also helpful if you have one. Taking these initial safety steps creates a secure environment for you to work. It protects your home from water damage. It also ensures you can focus on the repair without worry. Always prioritize your safety.

## Manually Draining Standing Water from Your Samsung Dishwasher

When your Samsung dishwasher fails to drain, the first thing you notice is standing water. This water needs to go before you can fix anything else. Manually removing this water is a necessary first step. It allows you to access the components inside the dishwasher. I find this part is often messy but simple.

You will need a bucket, towels, and perhaps a large cup or a small pot. Begin by scooping out as much water as you can from the dishwasher tub. Use your cup or pot to scoop the water into the bucket. Be careful not to splash water onto the floor or other electrical components. Go slowly to avoid making a bigger mess.

As the water level gets lower, you can use towels or sponges to soak up the remaining water. Wring the towels out into your bucket. Continue until the bottom of the dishwasher tub is as dry as possible. This makes it easier to work on the filter and other parts. It also prevents water from leaking onto your floor when you start checking other areas.

Sometimes, a dishwasher has a "drain" or "cancel" cycle. This cycle attempts to activate the drain pump to remove water. You can try running this cycle after manually removing most of the water. Press the "Cancel" or "Drain" button, or follow the instructions in your Samsung dishwasher manual for starting a drain cycle. This might clear minor clogs. It helps test if the pump works. However, if there's a serious blockage, the pump will likely struggle. Still, it is a quick test before you dive into physical cleaning. Removing the water first makes all subsequent steps safer and cleaner. This sets you up for successful troubleshooting.

## Clearing the Drain Filter and Sump Area

The drain filter is a common culprit for drainage issues in Samsung dishwashers. Food particles, grease, and other debris can build up here. This prevents water from draining properly. Cleaning this area is usually the most effective first step. I always start here when I face a drainage problem.

To access the filter, open the dishwasher door. You will see the filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. Samsung dishwashers often have a two-part filter system: a cylindrical main filter and a flat fine filter. Follow your specific model's instructions for removal. Typically, you twist the cylindrical filter counter-clockwise to unlock it. Then, you lift it out. The flat filter usually lifts straight up or unclips after the main filter is removed.

Once removed, take the filter parts to your sink. Rinse them under warm running water. Use a soft brush, like a dish brush or an old toothbrush, to gently scrub away any stuck-on food or grime. Pay close attention to the mesh screens. Make sure all holes are clear. You might be surprised at how much debris accumulates here.

After cleaning the filters, inspect the sump area at the bottom of the dishwasher. This is the cavity where the filters sit. Look for any large pieces of food, broken glass, or other foreign objects. These items can block the drain pump impeller. Carefully remove any debris you find. A wet/dry vacuum can also help remove any small pieces or standing water in the sump. Make sure the area is completely clear.

Once clean, reassemble the filters. Place the flat filter back first, ensuring it seats correctly. Then, insert the cylindrical filter and twist it clockwise to lock it into place. Make sure it is secure. A loose filter can also cause drainage problems. Cleaning the filter regularly prevents future clogs. This simple maintenance step greatly improves your dishwasher's performance. For comprehensive steps, see our article on [how to clean your dishwasher filter and drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-and-drain) and also our general guide on [how to clean your dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain).

## Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose

After checking the filter, the next area to investigate is the drain hose. This hose carries the dirty water from your Samsung dishwasher to your sink's drain or garbage disposal. Kinks or clogs in this hose can easily stop water flow. This means your dishwasher will not drain. I have found this to be a common issue, especially if the dishwasher has been moved recently.

Start by locating the drain hose. It is usually a corrugated plastic hose. It comes out from the back of the dishwasher. It connects to a fitting under your sink, often near the garbage disposal or a dedicated drain stub. Visually inspect the entire length of the hose. Look for any sharp bends or kinks. If you find one, gently straighten it out. Ensure the hose has a smooth, downward slope. It should not loop excessively high before connecting to the drain. An improper high loop can also prevent drainage.

If there are no visible kinks, the hose might be clogged internally. You may need to disconnect the hose to check for blockages. First, place a towel and a bucket under the connection point at the sink. Use pliers or a screwdriver to loosen the clamp holding the hose to the sink or disposal. Carefully pull the hose off. Be prepared for some residual water to spill out.

Next, disconnect the hose from the back of the dishwasher. This often requires pulling the dishwasher out from its cabinet space. Consult your Samsung manual for specific removal instructions. Once both ends are free, you can try to clear the hose. You can try to blow air through it. Alternatively, use a long, flexible brush, like a drain snake or a wire coat hanger, to push through any blockages. Rinse the hose thoroughly with water. Make sure water flows freely through it. Reattach the hose securely once it is clear. Ensure all clamps are tight to prevent leaks. This step is critical for proper water removal from your dishwasher.

## Checking Your Air Gap and Sink Drain

Sometimes, the drainage problem is not directly within the Samsung dishwasher itself. It can be caused by issues with your home's plumbing system. The air gap and the main sink drain are two external components that can affect your dishwasher's ability to drain properly. It is important to check these areas if your dishwasher still has standing water.

The air gap is a small, cylindrical fixture usually found on top of your kitchen sink. It has a small vent opening. Its purpose is to prevent contaminated sink water from siphoning back into the dishwasher. If this air gap becomes clogged, water cannot drain past it. Food particles or mineral buildup can cause this blockage. To check it, remove the chrome cap and then the plastic inner cap. Look for any debris inside. Use a small brush or a wire to clear any obstructions. Flush it with water from the faucet to ensure it flows freely.

Your kitchen sink drain or garbage disposal also plays a role. The dishwasher drain hose connects to one of these. If your sink drain is clogged, water will back up into the dishwasher. This is especially true if your garbage disposal is full or clogged. Run your garbage disposal for at least 30 seconds with plenty of water. This helps clear any food trapped inside. If your sink drain is slow or clogged, you might need to address that issue separately. Try pouring a mixture of baking soda and vinegar down the sink drain. Let it sit for a while, then flush with hot water.

A common oversight when installing a new dishwasher is failing to remove the knockout plug in the garbage disposal. This plug must be removed for the dishwasher to drain into the disposal. If you recently installed a new disposal or dishwasher and have never had drainage, check this. These external checks ensure your entire drainage path is clear. This includes connections beyond the dishwasher itself.

## Troubleshooting the Drain Pump

If you have cleaned the filter, checked the drain hose, and verified your external plumbing, the issue might be with the drain pump. The drain pump is responsible for forcing the water out of the Samsung dishwasher. A faulty pump or an obstruction within it will stop drainage. This is a more advanced step, but often fixable.

First, ensure the power is off to the dishwasher. Locate the drain pump. It is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher, often behind the filter and sump area. You might need to remove the lower spray arm and the sump cover for better access. Consult your Samsung dishwasher's service manual or an online diagram for its exact location. The pump typically has an impeller, which is a small fan-like component that pushes water.

Once you access the pump area, inspect it for any visible obstructions. Small pieces of glass, plastic, or hard food items can get past the filter and jam the impeller. Carefully use pliers or tweezers to remove any foreign objects. Try to gently spin the impeller with your finger to ensure it moves freely. If it does not spin, or if it feels stiff, there might be a blockage you cannot see, or the motor itself could be faulty.

Listen for the pump when the dishwasher attempts to drain. If you hear a humming noise but no water movement, the impeller might be jammed. If you hear nothing, the pump motor could be burnt out, or it is not receiving power. Checking the electrical connections to the pump requires a multimeter and electrical knowledge. If you are not comfortable with this, it is best to call a professional. A non-functional pump often needs replacement. This task is more involved. However, knowing the pump is the issue narrows down your problem. Addressing pump issues helps your Samsung dishwasher drain properly.
