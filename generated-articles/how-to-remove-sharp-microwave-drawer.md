This article will guide you through the process. We will cover necessary safety precautions and the tools you need. You will get clear, step-by-step instructions for removal. Knowing how to remove a Sharp microwave drawer helps with maintenance. It also allows for easier troubleshooting.

### Takeaway

*   **Follow Steps:** Open the drawer, locate screws, disconnect power, then slide out the unit.
*   **Seek Help:** If unsure, call a professional appliance technician.

### Clear, Concise Answer

To remove a Sharp microwave drawer, first disconnect power from the outlet or circuit breaker. Next, open the drawer fully and locate the mounting screws, usually on the side rails or frame. Remove these screws, carefully disconnect the power cord, and then gently slide the microwave drawer out of its cabinet opening.

## Why Remove Your Sharp Microwave Drawer?

People often ask about removing their Sharp microwave drawer for several reasons. Each reason points to a need for access or replacement. Understanding these common scenarios helps prepare for the task. It ensures you perform the removal for the right purpose.

One main reason is cleaning. Spills can happen inside the drawer. Food debris might fall into gaps or under the unit. Removing the drawer allows thorough cleaning of hidden areas. This keeps your kitchen hygienic and prevents odors. Regular cleaning also helps extend the life of your appliance.

Another common reason involves repairs or troubleshooting. Microwave drawers, like any appliance, can have issues. They might stop heating, fail to open, or make strange noises. Removing the unit provides access to internal components. This access is vital for diagnosing problems. It also allows for replacement of faulty parts. For example, if your [Sharp microwave is not heating](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-sharp-microwave-not-heating), removing it might be the first step in finding the problem.

Lastly, you might remove the drawer for replacement or renovation. Sometimes, the microwave reaches the end of its lifespan. You might also want to upgrade to a newer model. Kitchen renovations often require temporary appliance removal. This allows for new cabinetry or countertops. Knowing the removal steps saves time and effort during these projects.

## Essential Safety Precautions Before Starting

Before you start any work on your Sharp microwave drawer, safety must be your top priority. Ignoring safety steps can lead to electrical shock or personal injury. It can also cause damage to your appliance. Taking a few moments to prepare ensures a safe removal process.

First and foremost, disconnect the power. This is the most critical step. Find the circuit breaker panel in your home. Locate the breaker that controls power to your kitchen or the microwave outlet. Flip this breaker to the "off" position. If you are unsure which breaker it is, turn off the main breaker for your entire home. You can also unplug the microwave if its cord is accessible. Verifying power is off with a non-contact voltage tester adds an extra layer of safety.

Next, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Heavy-duty work gloves protect your hands from sharp edges. Microwaves often have metal components that can cause cuts. Safety glasses protect your eyes from dust or debris. These small items make a big difference in preventing accidents.

Clear your work area around the microwave drawer. Remove any items from the countertop or inside the drawer. This creates a clear space for the appliance to slide out. It also prevents items from falling and getting damaged. A clear work area reduces the risk of tripping or bumping. Ensure you have good lighting as well.

Consider having a helper. Microwave drawers are heavy. They can be awkward to handle alone. An extra set of hands makes lifting and moving the unit safer. It reduces the strain on your back and prevents dropping the appliance. Having someone assist also speeds up the process.

## Gathering the Right Tools for Sharp Microwave Drawer Disassembly

Having the correct tools makes the Sharp microwave drawer removal process much smoother. Using the wrong tools can damage the appliance or cause frustration. A quick check of your toolkit before starting saves time and effort. Most of the required tools are common household items.

You will need a set of screwdrivers. Philips head screwdrivers are often used for appliance mounting screws. A flathead screwdriver might also be useful for prying or adjusting. Check the screw types on your specific Sharp model before you begin. Having both sizes ensures you are prepared.

A utility knife or box cutter is helpful for cutting any caulk or sealant. Some installations use a bead of caulk around the microwave frame. This caulk needs to be cut before the unit can slide out. Use caution when using a utility knife to avoid scratching cabinets or yourself.

A flashlight or headlamp provides essential light. The area inside the cabinet opening can be dark. Good lighting helps you see screws and wires clearly. This prevents mistakes and makes the job easier. Even in a well-lit kitchen, extra light helps illuminate tight spaces.

You may also need a pair of pliers. Pliers can help with disconnecting wire harnesses. They can also assist with gripping any stubborn components. Choose a pair of slip-joint or needle-nose pliers for versatility. Always use caution when handling electrical wires.

Lastly, have a clean, stable surface ready to place the microwave on. A sturdy workbench or the floor covered with a blanket works well. This protects the microwave from scratches. It also prevents damage to your flooring. Planning where to put the drawer makes the removal process easier to manage.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Removing the Sharp Microwave Drawer

Removing your Sharp microwave drawer involves a series of clear steps. Following these instructions carefully will ensure a smooth process. We will go through each action needed to safely detach the unit from its cabinet.

### Step 1: Disconnect Power

Your first step, as mentioned earlier, is to disconnect the power. Locate your home's circuit breaker panel. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or microwave. Flip it to the "off" position. If no specific label exists, turn off the main breaker. This ensures no electricity flows to the unit during removal. Confirm power is off using a voltage tester.

### Step 2: Open the Microwave Drawer Fully

Gently open the microwave drawer all the way. Some models require pressing a button to fully extend. Opening the drawer provides access to the mounting screws. These screws typically secure the drawer to the surrounding cabinet. Make sure the drawer stays in the open position.

### Step 3: Locate and Remove Mounting Screws

Look for screws along the side rails or inside the front frame of the drawer opening. Sharp microwave drawers usually have screws on the left and right sides. There might also be screws on the top or bottom. Use a Philips head screwdriver to remove these screws. Keep the screws in a safe place, like a small cup, so you do not lose them. These screws are essential for reinstallation. If you are also thinking about how to fix a Sharp microwave drawer, gaining access is key, and these screws are the first barrier.

### Step 4: Disconnect the Power Cord

Once the mounting screws are out, the microwave drawer should be loose. Gently slide the unit forward a few inches. This action helps reveal the power cord. The power cord usually plugs into an outlet behind the microwave. Reach behind the unit and carefully unplug the cord from the wall outlet. Be careful not to strain the cord or outlet.

### Step 5: Carefully Slide Out the Microwave Drawer

With the power cord disconnected, you can now slide the microwave drawer out completely. This is where a second person is very helpful. Support the weight of the microwave drawer from underneath. Slowly pull the unit straight out from the cabinet opening. The microwave drawer is heavy, so lift with your legs, not your back. Once clear of the cabinet, place the unit on your prepared stable surface. This entire process is similar to [how to remove an LG oven bottom drawer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-lg-oven-bottom-drawer), just for a different appliance.

## Handling the Drawer Safely After Removal

Once you have successfully removed the Sharp microwave drawer, knowing how to handle it safely is important. This protects both you and the appliance from damage. Microwave drawers are large and heavy. They require careful management. Proper handling also prevents accidents during your repair or cleaning tasks.

Always ensure you have a clear path to move the drawer. If you are moving it to another room, clear any obstacles. Doors, furniture, or rugs can create tripping hazards. Planning your route before lifting helps prevent falls. It makes the relocation process much easier.

When carrying the drawer, maintain a firm grip. If two people are lifting, coordinate your movements. Lift from the bottom of the unit. Avoid holding onto fragile parts like the door or control panel. Distribute the weight evenly between yourselves. This reduces strain and the risk of dropping the microwave.

Place the microwave on a stable, flat surface. A workbench, sturdy table, or even the floor works well. Make sure the surface can support the microwave's weight. Using a blanket or piece of cardboard under the unit protects its finish. It also protects your floor or table from scratches.

If you are performing repairs, ensure the work area is well-lit. Good lighting helps you see small components clearly. Use a portable lamp or headlamp if needed. This reduces eye strain and helps you work more accurately.

After you finish your work, consider where to store the microwave temporarily. Keep it in a safe location where it will not be bumped or damaged. Protect it from dust and moisture if it will be stored for a while. Covering it with a sheet can keep it clean.

## Reinstalling Your Sharp Microwave Drawer

Once you have completed your cleaning, repair, or renovation, it is time to reinstall your Sharp microwave drawer. This process is essentially the reverse of removal. Careful attention to detail here ensures the microwave works correctly and safely.

### Step 1: Position the Microwave Drawer

First, carefully lift the Sharp microwave drawer back to the cabinet opening. If you have a helper, coordinate your lift. Ensure the unit is level with the cabinet opening. Support the full weight of the drawer. Slowly guide it into the opening.

### Step 2: Reconnect the Power Cord

As you slide the microwave into place, leave enough room to reach behind it. Reconnect the power cord to the wall outlet. Make sure the plug is fully inserted and secure. Tuck any excess cord away neatly. This prevents the cord from getting pinched.

### Step 3: Align and Secure Mounting Screws

Continue sliding the microwave drawer into the cabinet opening until it is flush. Align the screw holes on the microwave frame with the holes in your cabinet. Use the mounting screws you set aside earlier. Carefully reinsert each screw and tighten it. Do not overtighten; this can strip the screw holes. Ensure all screws are snug. This secures the drawer in its proper position. For those who installed a microwave drawer before, like [how to install a Bosch drawer microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-bosch-drawer-microwave), these steps will feel familiar.

### Step 4: Close and Test the Drawer

Once all screws are secure, gently close the microwave drawer. Ensure it slides smoothly. It should not stick or wobble. If it does, recheck the mounting screws and alignment. A smooth operation indicates correct installation.

### Step 5: Restore Power and Test Functionality

Go back to your circuit breaker panel. Flip the breaker for the kitchen or microwave back to the "on" position. Return to the microwave drawer. Open and close it a few times. Turn on the microwave and perform a test. Heat a cup of water for 30 seconds. Check if it heats properly and the controls work. This final test ensures your installation is successful. If you had issues like "not heating," this is the moment to confirm your [fix for your Sharp microwave drawer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-sharp-microwave-drawer) worked.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues During Sharp Microwave Drawer Removal

Even with a detailed guide, you might encounter minor problems when trying to remove your Sharp microwave drawer. Knowing how to troubleshoot these common issues can prevent frustration. It helps keep the removal process on track.

One common issue is the microwave drawer feeling stuck. If you have removed all visible screws and the drawer still does not budge, recheck for hidden fasteners. Some models might have screws under plastic caps or inside the drawer's top corners. Look closely along the entire frame. Also, check for any sealant or caulk around the edges. Use a utility knife to carefully cut through it. Ensure you apply even pressure when trying to pull the unit out. Do not force it, as this can cause damage.

Another problem might be difficulty accessing the power cord. Sometimes, the outlet is deep inside the cabinet. The cord might be short. If you cannot reach the cord to unplug it, try gently pulling the microwave forward a bit more. This might give you enough space. If not, consider turning off the main circuit breaker for the entire house. This is a safer alternative than struggling to reach the outlet. Always prioritize safety over convenience.

Damaged screws can also pose a challenge. If a screw head strips, you might need a screw extractor kit. These kits are available at most hardware stores. They help remove stripped or broken screws. Alternatively, you might need to carefully drill out the screw. If you choose to drill, use extreme caution. Be careful not to damage the microwave or cabinet.

Wires can sometimes get pinched or caught during removal. As you slide the microwave out, watch for any wires becoming taut. If you see a wire pulling tight, stop immediately. Adjust the microwave's angle or gently move the wire. This prevents damage to the wiring or the microwave's internal components. Electrical wire damage can be serious.

If you encounter a problem you cannot solve, consider stopping. It is better to call a qualified appliance technician. They have the experience and specialized tools to handle difficult situations. Forcing something can lead to more costly repairs. Sometimes, professional help is the safest and most efficient solution.

## Maintaining Your Sharp Microwave Drawer After Removal

Once you have successfully removed and reinstalled your Sharp microwave drawer, proper maintenance becomes easier. Regular care extends the life of your appliance. It also keeps it running efficiently. Use the access gained from removal to perform thorough cleaning and checks.

First, focus on cleaning. When the drawer is out, you can clean areas that are usually unreachable. Wipe down the external surfaces of the microwave. Pay attention to the control panel and handle. Use a mild cleaner and a soft cloth. Inside the microwave, wipe spills immediately. For stubborn stains, use a microwave-safe cleaner or a solution of water and vinegar. A clean microwave performs better. Learn more about [how to clean a drawer microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-drawer-microwave) effectively.

Next, inspect the drawer's glides and rollers. These parts allow the drawer to open and close smoothly. Over time, dust and debris can accumulate on them. Gently wipe them clean. Do not use lubricants like WD-40, as they can attract more dirt. If the glides are sticky, a dry brush or cloth often fixes the issue. If the drawer still sticks or wobbles, the glides might need replacement.

Check the power cord and plug for any signs of wear. Look for fraying, cuts, or discoloration. A damaged cord is a fire hazard. If you find any damage, replace the cord or have a professional inspect it. Also, ensure the outlet is clean and free of debris.

Listen for any unusual noises during operation. A well-maintained microwave drawer should operate quietly. Strange sounds might indicate a problem with the motor or fan. If you notice new noises after reinstalling, it could suggest a part is loose. You might need to open it up again.

Finally, keep the area around the microwave drawer clear. Do not block vents or airways. Proper ventilation is essential for the microwave to cool down. Restricted airflow can lead to overheating. This reduces efficiency and can shorten the appliance's lifespan. By following these maintenance tips, your Sharp microwave drawer will serve you well for many years.
