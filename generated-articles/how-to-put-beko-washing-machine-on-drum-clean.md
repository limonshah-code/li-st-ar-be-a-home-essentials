## Unlock a Fresh Wash: How To Put Beko Washing Machine On Drum Clean

A clean washing machine drum is very important. It stops smells and ensures your clothes come out fresh. Over time, residue from detergent and fabric softener can build up. This buildup causes unpleasant odors and can affect washing performance. Knowing how to put your Beko washing machine on drum clean keeps your appliance running well. It also protects your clothes from unwanted smells. This article shows you how to activate and use this vital cleaning feature. We cover preparation, frequency, and other maintenance tips.

### Takeaway

*   **Empty Your Machine:** Always remove all clothes and items from the drum.
*   **Add Cleaning Agent (Optional):** Use a descaler or washing machine cleaner if recommended.
*   **Select Drum Clean Program:** Find the specific "Drum Clean" or "SelfClean" cycle on your Beko's dial or display.
*   **Start the Cycle:** Press the start button. The machine will run a hot wash cycle to clean itself.
*   **Wipe Down:** After the cycle, wipe the door seal and dispenser drawer.

To put your Beko washing machine on drum clean, first ensure the drum is empty. Then, locate the "Drum Clean" or "SelfClean" program on your machine's control panel. Add a washing machine cleaner to the detergent drawer if desired. Finally, press the start button to begin the cycle.

### Understanding the Beko Drum Clean Function

Your Beko washing machine includes a special cleaning program. This function helps keep the drum hygienic. It removes dirt, detergent residue, and limescale that build up inside. This buildup can lead to bad smells and reduce cleaning effectiveness.

The drum clean cycle uses hot water. It often runs at temperatures like 70°C or 90°C. This high temperature helps kill bacteria and mold. It also dissolves fatty deposits and soap scum. Running this cycle regularly is a simple way to maintain your appliance. It helps prevent future issues with odors or residue on your laundry. Think of it as a deep clean for your machine. It ensures your clothes always get the best wash possible.

This cycle is different from a normal wash. It focuses on the machine's internal parts. It does not wash clothes. It is designed to clean the drum and inner components only. This specific function targets common problems like mildew. It ensures your Beko remains efficient and hygienic. A clean drum means fresh clothes every time.

### Locating the Drum Clean Program on Your Beko Washer

Finding the drum clean program is usually straightforward. Most Beko washing machines have a clearly marked setting. Look at your machine's program dial or digital display. You might see specific symbols or text labels.

Common names for this program include "Drum Clean." Some models may call it "SelfClean." Other machines might show a drum icon with a star or a brush symbol. If your machine has a display, you might scroll through the options. The user manual for your specific Beko model will confirm the exact name and symbol. It is always a good idea to consult the manual. This ensures you select the correct program.

Some older Beko models might not have a dedicated drum clean program. If this is the case, you can still clean your drum effectively. You can run a hot wash cycle with an empty drum. Add a suitable washing machine cleaner or descaler to the detergent drawer. This achieves a similar result. However, a dedicated drum clean program is optimized for this task. It often uses specific rinse patterns to ensure thorough cleaning. Understanding your specific Beko model's features makes maintenance easier.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Activating the Beko Drum Clean Cycle

Activating the drum clean cycle on your Beko washing machine is simple. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a thorough cleaning. Proper activation makes sure your machine cleans itself effectively.

1.  **Empty the Washing Machine:** Open the washing machine door. Remove all clothes, towels, and any other items from the drum. The drum must be completely empty for the cleaning cycle to work. This prevents damage to your laundry and allows the cleaning agents to work fully.
2.  **Check the Detergent Drawer:** Look inside the detergent dispenser drawer. Remove any old detergent residue or fabric softener buildup. You might need to pull the drawer out completely for a good clean. A clean drawer allows cleaning agents to dispense properly.
3.  **Add Cleaning Agent (Optional but Recommended):** You can add a washing machine descaler or a specialized washing machine cleaner. Pour the cleaner into the main wash compartment of the detergent drawer. Some cleaners might suggest putting them directly into the drum. Always follow the instructions on the cleaning product packaging. Do not use laundry detergent for this cycle, as it can create too much foam.
4.  **Close the Door and Drawer:** Firmly close the washing machine door. Make sure it latches properly. Also, push the detergent drawer back into its position. A secure door ensures the cycle starts without errors.
5.  **Select the Drum Clean Program:** Turn the program selection dial to the "Drum Clean" setting. If your machine has a digital display, press the "Program" button. Then use the arrow keys to find "Drum Clean" or "SelfClean." The exact name depends on your Beko model.
6.  **Start the Cycle:** Once the program is selected, press the "Start/Pause" button. The machine will begin the cleaning cycle. This cycle typically runs for a longer duration than a normal wash. It often uses very hot water.
7.  **Monitor the Cycle:** Let the machine complete the cycle without interruption. It might take 1 to 2 hours. Do not open the door during this time.
8.  **Wipe Down After Cycle:** After the cycle finishes, the machine will indicate completion. Open the door and wipe down the inside of the drum with a clean cloth. Pay special attention to the rubber door seal (gasket). Mildew often builds up here. Also, wipe the detergent dispenser drawer again.
9.  **Leave Door Ajar:** Leave the washing machine door slightly open. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps the drum dry completely. This prevents new mildew and odors from forming.

Following these steps ensures your Beko washing machine stays clean and fresh. This also helps prolong its lifespan.

### Preparing Your Beko Washing Machine for a Drum Clean

Before you start the drum clean cycle, a little preparation goes a long way. This ensures the cleaning process is most effective. Skipping these simple steps can reduce the cleaning power. Proper preparation helps the drum clean cycle focus on its task.

First, always make sure the washing machine drum is completely empty. Check thoroughly for any forgotten items, like socks or small toys. Even a single item can absorb water and prevent a proper clean. It can also get damaged by the hot water and cleaning agents. An empty drum allows the hot water and cleaning solution to circulate freely. This reaches every part of the drum's interior.

Next, inspect the detergent dispenser drawer. Pull it out fully if possible. You will often find old detergent and fabric softener residue built up inside. This sticky film is a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. Clean the drawer by rinsing it under warm water. Use a small brush or old toothbrush to scrub away stubborn residue. If the drawer is very dirty, a mild soap solution can help. A clean drawer ensures that any added cleaning agents during the drum clean cycle disperse correctly. It also prevents new residue from forming immediately.

Also, examine the rubber door seal, or gasket. This area is prone to accumulating lint, hair, and moisture. This creates a prime environment for mold and mildew growth. Wipe the gasket with a damp cloth, paying attention to the folds and crevices. You might see black mold here. This needs more attention. For significant mold, you can use a diluted bleach solution (check your machine's manual for compatibility) or a specialized mold cleaner. Always wear gloves for this. Cleaning the gasket before the cycle helps remove visible grime. The hot water from the drum clean then further sanitizes this area. This pre-cleaning step is crucial for preventing odors. It also ensures all parts of your Beko washing machine contribute to a truly clean result. This preparation maximizes the efficiency of the drum clean program. It supports the overall hygiene of your appliance.

### Optimal Frequency for Beko Washing Machine Drum Cleaning

How often you run the drum clean cycle on your Beko washing machine matters. The ideal frequency depends on several factors. These factors include how often you use your machine, the type of laundry you wash, and your water hardness. Regular cleaning prevents problems before they start.

For most households, running the drum clean cycle once a month is a good general guideline. This schedule helps prevent the buildup of mold, mildew, and detergent residue. If you use your washing machine frequently, say several times a day, you might need to clean it more often. Consider running the drum clean every two to three weeks. Heavy usage leads to faster accumulation of grime.

The type of laundry also plays a role. If you often wash very dirty items, like muddy sports clothes or pet blankets, more frequent cleaning is wise. These items introduce more dirt and organic matter into the machine. Washing delicate items that require cold water washes more often can also increase the need for cleaning. Cold water does not kill bacteria as effectively as hot water. This can contribute to odor development over time.

Water hardness is another important factor. Hard water contains more minerals. These minerals can leave behind limescale deposits inside your machine. Limescale can trap dirt and detergent residue. It also reduces your machine's efficiency. If you live in an area with hard water, consider using a descaler with your drum clean cycle more often. Running the drum clean every 3-4 weeks might be better. Some Beko models have an indicator that tells you when a drum clean is recommended. Pay attention to this warning.

Signs that your Beko washing machine needs a drum clean include unpleasant smells from the drum or on your clean laundry. If you see visible mold around the door seal, it's definitely time for a clean. Sticking to a regular schedule helps avoid these issues. It keeps your washing machine performing at its best. If your Beko washing machine experiences other operational issues, such as [why is my Beko washing machine not turning on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-beko-washing-machine-not-turning-on), or if it [keeps tripping the electric](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-beko-washing-machine-keep-tripping-the-electric), these are signs of problems beyond simple cleaning.

### Beyond the Drum Clean: Additional Maintenance Tips for Your Beko

While the drum clean cycle is essential, other maintenance steps also keep your Beko washing machine in top condition. Combining these practices ensures your appliance stays clean and efficient. This extends its lifespan and improves your laundry results.

*   **Clean the Door Seal (Gasket) Regularly:** The rubber seal around the door is a common spot for mold and mildew. After each wash, wipe the gasket dry with a cloth. Pay attention to the folds and crevices. This removes moisture and lint, preventing mold growth. If you see mold, clean it with a diluted bleach solution or a specialized cleaner. Consistent drying of the seal prevents odors from starting.

*   **Maintain the Detergent Dispenser Drawer:** Residue from detergents and fabric softeners can build up in the drawer. This can cause blockages and lead to bad smells. Pull out the drawer periodically (monthly or bi-monthly) and clean it thoroughly. Rinse it under warm water. Use a small brush to remove all residue. This ensures proper dispensing of laundry products. If your Beko is [not taking the fabric conditioner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-beko-washing-machine-not-taking-the-fabric-conditioner), a clogged dispenser drawer is often the cause.

*   **Check and Clean the Drain Filter:** Most washing machines have a drain filter. This filter traps small items like coins, buttons, and lint. A clogged filter can prevent your machine from draining properly. This can lead to standing water and odors. Locate your Beko's drain filter (usually at the bottom front of the machine, behind a small access panel). Place a shallow pan underneath to catch water. Unscrew the filter slowly. Clean any debris from the filter and its housing. Re-insert and screw it back tightly. Checking this filter every few months prevents drainage issues.

*   **Use the Right Amount of Detergent:** Using too much detergent creates excessive suds. These suds can leave residue in the drum and pipes. This residue then becomes a food source for mold and bacteria. Follow the detergent manufacturer's recommendations. Adjust the amount based on your water hardness and load size. High-efficiency (HE) detergents are designed for low-sudsing and are best for modern machines.

*   **Leave the Door Ajar After Washing:** After you finish a load of laundry, leave the washing machine door slightly open. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps the drum and gasket dry out completely. A dry environment prevents the growth of mold and mildew. This simple habit makes a big difference in preventing musty smells.

*   **Periodically Run a Hot Empty Wash:** Even without a dedicated drum clean cycle, a very hot wash can help. Run an empty cycle at the highest temperature setting. You can add a cup of white vinegar or baking soda to the detergent dispenser for an extra boost. This helps sanitize the drum and pipes. For a general guide on how to perform this kind of cleaning, you can review methods for [how to clean washing machine drum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-drum).

By regularly performing these extra maintenance steps alongside your drum clean cycle, you can keep your Beko washing machine smelling fresh and working efficiently for years.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues with Beko Drum Clean

Even with proper maintenance, you might encounter issues when trying to put your Beko washing machine on drum clean. Here are some common problems and solutions.

*   **Drum Clean Cycle Not Starting:**
    *   **Check the Door:** Make sure the washing machine door is fully closed and latched. If the door is not shut properly, the machine will not start any cycle. If your [Beko washing machine door is not opening](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-beko-washing-machine-door-not-opening), you need to resolve that first.
    *   **Power Supply:** Confirm the machine is plugged in and receiving power. Check the circuit breaker if necessary.
    *   **Error Codes:** Look for any error codes displayed on the machine's screen. Consult your Beko user manual to understand what the code means and how to fix it.
    *   **Pause/Cancel Button:** Ensure you haven't accidentally pressed the "Pause" or "Cancel" button. Press "Start" firmly.

*   **Unpleasant Odors After Drum Clean:**
    *   **Gasket Cleaning:** The drum clean cycle cleans the inside of the drum. However, the rubber door seal (gasket) might still harbor mold. Manually clean the gasket with a damp cloth and a mold cleaner if needed.
    *   **Detergent Drawer:** Leftover residue in the detergent drawer can also smell. Ensure it's thoroughly cleaned.
    *   **Drain Filter:** A clogged drain filter can trap smelly stagnant water. Clean it regularly.
    *   **Repeat Cycle:** If odors persist, run the drum clean cycle again. Consider using a stronger washing machine cleaner.
    *   **Leave Door Ajar:** Always leave the door open after the cycle to allow the drum to air dry.

*   **Drum Clean Cycle Taking Too Long or Not Finishing:**
    *   **Water Supply:** Ensure the water taps are fully open and there's good water pressure. Low water pressure can extend cycle times.
    *   **Drainage Issues:** A partially clogged drain hose or filter can make the machine take longer to drain. This prolongs the cycle. Check your drain filter. If your Beko is [not spinning or draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-beko-washing-machine-not-spinning-or-draining), it needs immediate attention.
    *   **Imbalance:** Although rare for an empty drum, severe imbalance in the machine itself could theoretically cause issues, but this is usually tied to laundry loads.
    *   **Machine Software Glitch:** Unplug the machine for 5-10 minutes. Then plug it back in. This can reset the electronics.

*   **Machine Vibrating Excessively During Drum Clean:**
    *   **Leveling:** Check if the washing machine is level. Uneven legs can cause excessive vibration during any cycle, including drum clean. Adjust the feet as needed.
    *   **Transit Bolts:** If the machine is new, ensure the transit bolts (shipping bolts) have been removed from the back. These are only for transport and must be removed before use.

If these basic troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issue, it may indicate a more serious problem. In such cases, contact Beko customer support or a qualified appliance technician for assistance.
