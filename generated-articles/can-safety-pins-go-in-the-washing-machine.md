## Washing Safety Pins: What You Need to Know

Have you ever found a stray safety pin clinging to your laundry? It is a common household item, used for temporary repairs or securing garments. A question often comes up during laundry day: "Can safety pins go in the washing machine?" Many people wonder about the risks and the best practices.

The simple answer is that putting safety pins in the washing machine can lead to various problems. These small metal objects might damage your clothes or even your appliance. Understanding these risks helps you make better choices for your laundry and machine. This article will explore why safety pins pose a threat and offer practical solutions. I will guide you through preventing damage and suggest safer alternatives for your laundry needs.

### Takeaway

*   **Remove Pins:** Always check garments for safety pins before washing.
*   **Prevent Damage:** Safety pins can tear fabric, snag clothes, and damage washing machine parts.
*   **Avoid Rust:** Metal pins can rust and stain your clothes.
*   **Use Mesh Bags:** If removal is not possible, secure pins and place items in a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Inspect Machine:** After a pin incident, check your washing machine's drum and filter for loose pins.

**Can safety pins go in the washing machine?**

No, safety pins should not go in the washing machine. These small metal items can cause significant damage to both your laundry and the appliance itself. They can snag fabrics, create holes, rust, and even scratch or jam internal machine components. It is best to remove them before starting a wash cycle.

### Understanding the Risks of Pins in Your Washing Machine

Placing safety pins in the washing machine creates several risks. These risks affect both your clothing and the appliance itself. Many people overlook these small items. However, their presence can lead to costly repairs or ruined garments. It is important to understand these dangers to protect your belongings.

Small metal objects like safety pins are not suitable for a vigorous wash cycle. The constant tumbling and water agitation can turn them into destructive tools. They can move freely, impacting various parts of your machine and other laundry items. A simple oversight can cause a lot of trouble. I always check pockets and garment seams to avoid these issues.

#### Potential Damage to Your Appliance

A safety pin can become a serious problem for your washing machine. Pins can get caught in the drum's tiny holes. They can also scratch the inner surface of the drum. This scratching can lead to rust spots or create rough areas that snag future loads.

More severely, a pin might make its way into the washing machine's drain pump or filter. When this happens, it can jam the pump. A jammed pump prevents water from draining properly. This can cause the machine to malfunction or even flood. Fixing a damaged pump is often expensive and requires professional help. Understanding [what is a washing machine](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-a-washing-machine) helps you see how such small items can disrupt its complex mechanics.

#### Harm to Your Clothing Items

Safety pins pose a direct threat to your clothes. Their sharp points and edges easily snag fabric threads. This creates runs, tears, or small holes in garments. Even strong fabrics can suffer damage from a loose pin.

Delicate items are especially vulnerable. Silks, lace, and thin cottons can unravel quickly from a pin's attack. The pin might also attach itself to another garment. This can create a chain reaction of snags and tears. I always feel a bit sad when a favorite shirt gets a hole from something preventable.

### Why Safety Pins Pose a Threat During Laundry Cycles

Safety pins are useful tools outside the washing machine. Inside, they become liabilities. Their design makes them dangerous during laundry cycles. The combination of metal, movement, and water creates several specific problems. These problems go beyond simple scratching.

The environment inside a washing machine is harsh for metal objects. Water, detergent, and high temperatures affect pins negatively. This can lead to issues that harm your clothes and machine. It is crucial to understand these effects.

#### The Problem of Rust and Stains

Most safety pins are not completely rust-proof. Even "rust-resistant" pins can corrode over time or with repeated exposure to water. When a metal pin rusts in the washing machine, it releases rust particles. These particles can transfer onto your wet clothes.

Rust stains are particularly difficult to remove from fabric. They leave orange or brown marks that often become permanent. Light-colored clothing is highly susceptible to these unsightly stains. Imagine putting a white shirt in and taking it out with rust spots. This is a common issue when metal items are accidentally washed. For more insight into these risks, you can explore [can you put safety pins in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-safety-pins-in-the-washing-machine).

#### Snagging and Tearing Fabrics

The tumbling action of a washing machine is very powerful. A loose safety pin moves around freely inside the drum. Its sharp point and open clasp become hazards. The pin can easily catch on fabric loops or threads.

Once caught, the pin can pull threads, creating snags or runs. If the fabric gets twisted around the pin, it can tear a hole. This is especially true for delicate materials. Even thick towels can suffer damage. The continuous motion exacerbates this problem, turning minor snags into larger tears.

### Best Practices: Preparing Items with Safety Pins for Washing

Proper preparation is key to preventing damage from safety pins. It only takes a few moments to check your clothes. This small effort saves you from potential headaches and expenses. Adopting a simple routine before doing laundry makes a big difference.

I have learned that being thorough before a wash cycle prevents many problems. This includes checking pockets and looking for any attached items. Taking these extra steps ensures a smoother laundry experience. It keeps both my clothes and my washing machine safe.

#### Removing Pins Before Washing

The simplest and best practice is to remove all safety pins from garments. Before you load any item into the washing machine, give it a quick check. Look for pins on tags, temporary repairs, or securing embellishments. I make it a habit to check pockets and turn clothes right-side out.

Once removed, place the pins in a safe container. This prevents them from getting lost or accidentally re-entering the laundry. It also keeps them ready for future use. This proactive step eliminates all risks associated with washing metal pins.

#### Securing Pins for Delicate Washes

Sometimes, removing a safety pin is not feasible. Perhaps it holds a delicate lace trim in place. Maybe it secures a decorative element. In such cases, you must secure the pin properly. First, make sure the pin is completely closed. The clasp should be fully engaged, leaving no sharp point exposed.

Next, place the item inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag acts as a protective barrier. It contains the pin, preventing it from snagging other items or the machine itself. Choose a sturdy mesh bag designed for delicate items. This method significantly reduces the risk of damage.

### Using Mesh Laundry Bags for Pin Protection

Mesh laundry bags are incredibly useful tools for garment care. They offer a simple solution for items that might cause problems in the wash. When dealing with safety pins, these bags become essential. They create a protective enclosure for specific items.

I consider mesh bags a must-have for my laundry routine. They protect not just pin-attached items but also delicate garments. Using them correctly extends the life of your clothes and safeguards your appliance. It is a small investment that offers big returns in terms of peace of mind.

#### Benefits of Laundry Bags

Mesh laundry bags serve multiple purposes. They prevent small items like socks from getting lost. They also keep delicate fabrics from stretching or tearing. For items with safety pins, the bag contains the pin. This stops the pin from opening, snagging, or scratching other clothes.

The bag acts as a physical barrier. It prevents the pin from directly contacting the washing machine drum. This reduces the risk of scratches or becoming lodged in the drain pump. It ensures a safer wash for both the pinned item and the rest of your laundry load.

#### Choosing the Right Bag Size

Selecting the correct mesh bag size is important. For a single item with a safety pin, a small bag works well. Ensure the item has room to move slightly but not enough for the pin to escape. Do not overstuff the bag.

If you have multiple small items or a larger garment with a pin, use a larger bag. The key is to allow water and detergent to circulate effectively. This ensures proper cleaning without compromising the bag's protective function. Always zip or tie the bag securely to keep contents inside.

### Alternatives to Using Safety Pins in Laundry

While safety pins are handy, they are not always the best solution for laundry-bound items. Many alternatives exist that offer similar functionality without the associated risks. Exploring these options can save you trouble down the line. I often look for safer ways to secure items.

These alternatives are often gentler on fabrics and completely safe for washing machines. They provide peace of mind during the wash cycle. Considering these options before using a safety pin can prevent future laundry mishaps. It is about choosing the right tool for the job.

#### Stitching Temporary Fixes

For temporary repairs that need to withstand a wash, consider a quick stitch. A simple hand stitch can hold a hem or seam in place more securely than a pin. Use a needle and thread in a contrasting color for easy removal after washing. This method holds the fabric firmly without the risk of metal.

Stitching eliminates any chance of snagging or rust stains. It is a safe and reliable way to keep parts of a garment together during cleaning. Once the garment is clean, you can remove the stitches. Then you can make a permanent repair.

#### Magnetic Closures and Garment Clips

Modern laundry accessories offer safe alternatives. Some temporary closures use magnets instead of pins. These magnetic clips can secure parts of clothing without puncturing fabric. They are typically made from plastic or non-corrosive materials. This makes them safe for washing.

Another option includes plastic garment clips. These clips are designed to hold fabric layers together. They often feature smooth edges to prevent damage. Always ensure any magnetic or plastic closure is sturdy and machine-washable before use. These items offer convenience without the drawbacks of metal safety pins.

### Washing Machine Maintenance After Pin Incidents

Accidents happen. Despite your best efforts, a safety pin might still end up in the washing machine. If you suspect a pin has gone through a cycle, immediate action is necessary. This helps prevent further damage and keeps your machine running smoothly. I always feel a bit of dread when I hear an unexpected clunk during a wash.

Addressing the issue promptly can save you from bigger problems. Regular checks and knowing how to deal with foreign objects are important aspects of machine care. This section guides you through the necessary steps.

#### Checking for Foreign Objects

After a suspected pin incident, first, check the washing machine drum. Carefully inspect the inner surface for any scratches or embedded pins. Run your hand slowly along the drum walls. Feel for any sharp points or rough areas. If you find a pin, remove it immediately.

Next, check the drain pump filter. This filter traps lint, small items, and foreign objects before they reach the pump. Consult your washing machine's manual to locate the filter. It is usually at the bottom front of the machine. Turn off and unplug the machine before accessing the filter. Open the filter compartment, drain any residual water, and carefully remove the filter. Look for any pins or debris. Clean the filter and replace it securely. This step is vital for [do-it-yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) maintenance.

#### Dealing with Rust Stains in the Drum

If a safety pin rusted in your washing machine, you might see rust stains inside the drum. These stains need prompt removal to prevent them from transferring to future laundry loads. Do not use abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the drum.

Instead, use a rust-specific cleaner designed for appliances. Alternatively, a paste made of baking soda and vinegar can work. Apply the paste to the rust spots. Let it sit for about 30 minutes. Then, scrub gently with a soft cloth. Rinse thoroughly and run an empty hot water cycle with a cup of white vinegar. This helps flush out any remaining residue.

### Special Considerations for Different Pin Materials

Not all safety pins are created equal. Their material composition plays a big role in how they react to water and detergent. Understanding these differences can help you make informed decisions. It can also guide you in choosing pins that are less likely to cause problems.

I always pay attention to the material of any metal item going near my laundry. Different metals have different properties. This affects their susceptibility to rust and corrosion. Knowing this helps in preventing issues.

#### Stainless Steel vs. Nickel-Plated Pins

Most common safety pins are made from steel and then plated. Nickel-plated pins are very common. They have a thin layer of nickel over steel. This plating helps resist rust. However, if the plating chips or wears off, the underlying steel can rust. This happens especially in a wet environment like a washing machine. Repeated washing can degrade the plating.

Stainless steel pins are a better choice if you must wash items with pins. Stainless steel naturally resists rust due to its chromium content. It does not rely on a coating that can wear away. While "rust-proof" is a strong claim, high-quality stainless steel pins are far more resistant to corrosion. They are less likely to leave stains on your clothes. However, even stainless steel can cause physical damage to your machine or clothes.

#### Decorative Pins and Embellishments

Beyond basic safety pins, many garments feature decorative pins or metal embellishments. These items often come with unique challenges. They can be made from various metals, plastics, or even include gemstones. Many are not designed for machine washing.

Always check the care label on garments with decorative pins. If machine washing is an option, remove the pin if possible. If not, secure it tightly and place the garment in a mesh laundry bag. Consider hand washing items with delicate or valuable pins. This prevents damage to the embellishment and your washing machine. For general pin care, understanding resources like [how to clean enamel pins](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-enamel-pins) can offer helpful insights, though enamel pins are usually not for laundry.
