When your Frigidaire oven light stays on, it often signals an issue with the door light switch, a problem with the main electronic control board, or misalignment of the oven door preventing proper switch engagement. These are the primary reasons for continuous illumination. Addressing these components usually resolves the issue quickly.

## Understanding Your Frigidaire Oven Light System

Your Frigidaire oven light seems simple, but it is part of a connected system. This system ensures the light turns on when needed and off when the door closes. Understanding how this system works helps diagnose problems when your oven light stays on. The light bulb, switch, and control board are the main players.

### How Oven Lights Work

Oven lights operate on a simple principle. They usually turn on when the door opens and off when the door closes. A small push-button switch, typically located near the oven door frame, detects the door's position. When the door pushes the switch in, it breaks the circuit, turning the light off. When the door releases the switch, it completes the circuit, and the light comes on. Some newer models might use magnetic sensors or more integrated systems. However, the fundamental idea remains the same.

### Common Components Involved

Several parts work together to control your Frigidaire oven light. The most obvious component is the light bulb itself. Inside the oven, the bulb provides illumination. Next, there is the light switch, usually a small plunger-style button. This button is crucial for signaling the oven about the door's state. Finally, the electronic control board often manages the power supply to the light circuit. A fault in any of these components can cause the oven light to remain on. For example, if the light switch gets stuck in the "on" position, the light will not turn off. Understanding these parts helps when you try to fix the problem.

## The Malfunctioning Light Switch: A Common Culprit

A stuck or broken light switch is the most frequent reason your Frigidaire oven light stays on. This small component, usually located near the oven door frame, controls the light's operation. When the oven door closes, it should press this switch, turning the light off. If the switch fails to engage or gets stuck, the light remains on. This issue is often easy to diagnose and sometimes simple to fix.

### Identifying a Stuck Switch

First, open your oven door and locate the light switch. It typically looks like a small button or plunger. It is usually found on the oven frame, either at the top or side, where the door makes contact. Press the switch in and release it several times. Feel if it moves freely and springs back out completely. If the switch feels stiff, sticky, or does not pop back out fully, it is likely stuck. Sometimes, food debris or grease can build up around the switch, causing it to malfunction. You can also listen for a faint click when you press it. A lack of click might indicate an internal issue.

### Cleaning and Freeing the Switch

Before trying any repairs, disconnect your Frigidaire oven from power. Unplug it from the wall outlet or flip the circuit breaker. Use a damp cloth and a mild degreaser to clean around the light switch. Gently wipe away any visible grime or sticky residue. You can use a cotton swab or a small brush for hard-to-reach areas. Be careful not to force the switch. After cleaning, try pressing the switch again to see if it moves more freely. Often, a good cleaning is enough to resolve the issue. If the switch now moves smoothly, reconnect power and test the light.

You might need to gently pry out the old switch using a flat-head screwdriver. Note how the wires connect to the old switch. Take a picture if it helps. Then, disconnect the wires and connect them to the new switch. Push the new switch firmly into its slot until it clicks into place. Ensure the replacement switch is compatible with your specific Frigidaire oven model. This simple replacement can often resolve the issue entirely. Many oven light problems, like [why your Frigidaire oven turns off when you open the door](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-oven-turn-off-when-i-open-the-door), are related to these small, often overlooked, door components.

## Beyond the Switch: Control Board Issues

While a faulty light switch is a common cause, the electronic control board can also be responsible for your Frigidaire oven light staying on. The control board is the brain of your oven. It manages power to various components, including the oven light. If this board malfunctions, it can send a continuous signal to the light, keeping it illuminated. Diagnosing control board issues is more complex than dealing with a simple switch.

### Symptoms of a Failing Control Board

A failing control board can exhibit various symptoms beyond just the light problem. You might notice inconsistent oven temperatures or error codes on the display. The oven might not heat up at all, or it might turn off unexpectedly. For example, if you encounter the problem where [your Frigidaire oven keeps turning off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-oven-keep-turning-off), the control board is a prime suspect. Buttons on the control panel might not respond, or the oven fan might run continuously. These are all signs that the control board might be sending incorrect signals. If the oven light stays on along with other electrical quirks, the control board is a strong possibility.
