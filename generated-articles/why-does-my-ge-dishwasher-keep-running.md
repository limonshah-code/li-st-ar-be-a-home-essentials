## Why Your GE Dishwasher Keeps Running Non-Stop

It is frustrating when your GE dishwasher keeps running. You expect it to finish its cycle and shut off. Instead, it continues to hum or fill, never reaching completion. This issue can waste water and energy. It also indicates an underlying problem with the appliance. Knowing the common reasons can help you diagnose and fix the issue.

This article will explore the main reasons why your GE dishwasher might run continuously. We will cover everything from simple user errors to more complex component failures. You will find practical troubleshooting steps. We also offer advice on when to call a professional. My goal is to help you understand your appliance. I want you to get your kitchen routine back on track.

### Takeaway

If your GE dishwasher keeps running, check these points:

*   **Door Latch:** Ensure the door closes and latches securely.
*   **Overflow Float Switch:** Verify the float switch moves freely and is not stuck.
*   **Water Inlet Valve:** Check if the valve is stuck open, causing constant water fill.
*   **Drain System:** Look for clogs in the filter, drain hose, or pump.
*   **Control Board:** A faulty control board may send incorrect signals.
*   **Thermostat/Sensor:** These parts monitor water temperature and can fail.
*   **User Error:** Confirm you selected the correct cycle and are not in a delay mode.

Your GE dishwasher keeps running because of a faulty component. Common causes include a stuck overflow float switch, a bad water inlet valve, a malfunctioning control board, or a problem with the door latch. These issues prevent the dishwasher from completing its cycle or properly detecting its state.

## Understanding Continuous Dishwasher Operation

When your GE dishwasher keeps running, it signals a problem. A normal cycle includes washing, rinsing, and drying phases. Each phase has a set duration. The dishwasher should stop when all phases complete. Continuous operation means it fails to advance or terminate the cycle. This can happen during filling, washing, or draining stages.

Many internal systems work together for proper operation. Sensors monitor water levels and temperature. The control board manages these processes. Valves control water flow. Pumps handle water circulation and drainage. A malfunction in any of these parts can disrupt the sequence. We will explore each possible cause in detail. This helps you understand why your appliance is not working as it should.

## The Door Latch and Interlock Switch

One common reason your GE dishwasher keeps running is a problem with the door latch. The door latch is a safety device. It ensures the dishwasher door is fully closed and secured. This prevents water from leaking out during operation. The latch works with an interlock switch. This switch signals the control board that the door is shut. If the control board does not receive this signal, the dishwasher may pause. It might also restart a cycle or run continuously. It simply waits for the door to be properly closed.

### How to Check the Door Latch

I always start with the simplest checks. First, close the dishwasher door firmly. You should hear a distinct click. This click means the latch engages. Sometimes, items in the dishwasher can block the door from closing completely. Rearrange your dishes if needed. Over time, the latch mechanism itself can wear out or become misaligned. This prevents proper engagement.

Look for visible damage to the latch. Small plastic tabs or metal components can break. If the door does not feel secure, the latch likely needs replacement. A faulty door switch will not send the "closed" signal. The dishwasher assumes the door is open. It then waits indefinitely to resume. For any dishwasher not starting due to door issues, this is a prime suspect, just as if your [dishwasher is not running at all](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-dishwasher-not-running). Replacing a faulty latch or switch is a straightforward repair for many DIYers.

## Issues with the Overflow Float Switch

The overflow float switch is a critical safety feature. It prevents your GE dishwasher from overfilling with water. This small component typically sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It includes a float that rises with the water level. As water fills the tub, the float lifts. When it reaches a certain height, it activates a switch. This switch tells the control board to stop filling.

If this float switch becomes stuck in the "up" position, the dishwasher thinks there is always too much water. It may then try to drain continuously. Conversely, if it is stuck in the "down" position, it may never signal to stop filling. This causes the dishwasher to keep running as it tries to reach the appropriate water level. This is a common problem in many dishwashers, much like similar issues found when a [Samsung dishwasher runs on its own](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-running-on-its-own).

### Inspecting the Float Switch

I check the float switch next. Open your GE dishwasher door. Locate the plastic float in the tub's bottom. It usually looks like a small cap or a plastic cylinder. Make sure it moves up and down freely. Sometimes, food debris, detergent residue, or mineral deposits can stick the float in place. Clean around the float if you find any buildup.

Manually lift and release the float. It should move smoothly without resistance. If it feels stiff or remains in one position, it needs attention. You might be able to clean it. If cleaning does not help, the switch itself might be faulty. The switch sends signals to the control board. If the switch fails internally, it provides incorrect water level readings. Replacing a faulty float switch requires some disassembly. It is a common fix for continuous running issues.

## Understanding the Water Inlet Valve

The water inlet valve controls the flow of water into your GE dishwasher. This valve is an electromechanical device. It opens when energized by the control board. It allows water from your home supply to enter the dishwasher. Once the desired water level is reached, the control board de-energizes the valve. This closes the valve and stops water flow.

When a GE dishwasher keeps running, a faulty water inlet valve is a major suspect. If the valve gets stuck in the "open" position, water will continuously flow into the tub. The dishwasher's sensors will detect an overfill condition. This will prompt the drain pump to engage. The dishwasher then enters a cycle of filling and draining repeatedly. It runs non-stop, trying to achieve the correct water level. This also applies to other brands, such as when a [Frigidaire dishwasher keeps running](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-dishwasher-keep-running).

### Diagnosing a Faulty Inlet Valve

You can often hear a continuous trickling sound if the inlet valve is bad. Even when the dishwasher should be off, you might hear it. Disconnect the power to your dishwasher first for safety. Visually inspect the water inlet valve. It is usually located behind the lower access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher. Look for any signs of corrosion or mineral buildup.

Sometimes, debris can get lodged in the valve, preventing it from closing fully. You can try turning off the water supply to the dishwasher. If the water stops entering, the valve is the likely culprit. To confirm, you can test the solenoid on the valve with a multimeter. A reading outside the manufacturer's specifications indicates a bad solenoid. This means replacing the entire water inlet valve. This repair often involves disconnecting the water line and electrical connections.

## The Drain Pump and Clog Issues

A functional drain system is vital for a dishwasher to complete its cycle. After washing and rinsing, the GE dishwasher needs to pump out dirty water. This involves the drain pump, the drain hose, and the internal filter system. If the dishwasher cannot drain properly, it will keep running. It tries to get rid of the water. This can manifest as the dishwasher appearing to run endlessly in a drain cycle.

Clogs are frequent culprits. Food particles, grease, or even foreign objects can block the filter. They can also obstruct the drain hose or the drain pump impeller. When this happens, water cannot exit the tub efficiently. The dishwasherâ€™s water level sensor will detect that the water level is still high. It will command the drain pump to continue working. This leads to continuous running.

### Clearing Drain System Clogs

I always check the drain system first when I suspect drainage issues. First, disconnect power to your GE dishwasher. Remove the lower dish rack. Access the filter at the bottom of the tub. GE dishwashers often have a removable filter that you can clean. Refer to your GE dishwasher manual for specific instructions on how to access and clean the filter. If you want to know more about this, you can check out [how to find if your GE dishwasher has a filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-ge-dishwasher-have-filter). Clean any visible debris from the filter.

Next, inspect the drain hose. It connects the dishwasher to your garbage disposal or drain pipe. Look for kinks or blockages. You may need to disconnect the hose to clear it. Be ready for some water spillage. If the filter and hose are clear, the issue might be with the drain pump itself. The pump's impeller might be jammed or broken. Clearing a pump blockage can involve removing the pump, which is a more advanced task. You might need to consult [how to put your GE dishwasher back together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-ge-dishwasher-back-together) after such a repair.

## The Role of the Control Board

The control board is the brain of your GE dishwasher. It receives signals from various sensors. It then sends commands to different components. This includes the water inlet valve, wash pump, drain pump, and heating element. The control board ensures each cycle phase occurs at the correct time and for the right duration. It orchestrates the entire washing process.

A faulty control board can cause a GE dishwasher to keep running indefinitely. It might send incorrect signals. For instance, it could tell the water inlet valve to stay open too long. Or, it could fail to register that a cycle has completed. This could lead to an endless wash or drain cycle. Sometimes, the internal timer or programming on the board can glitch. This results in the dishwasher never finishing its program. This is a complex issue, often requiring professional diagnosis.

### Recognizing Control Board Failure

You might suspect a control board issue if simpler fixes do not work. Common signs of a failing control board include:
*   **Random Cycles:** The dishwasher starts cycles on its own.
*   **Buttons Not Responding:** Some or all control panel buttons do not work.
*   **Incorrect Cycle Duration:** Cycles finish too quickly or run too long.
*   **Error Codes:** The display shows error codes that do not clear.

Before replacing the control board, try a hard reset. Unplug the dishwasher from power for a few minutes. Then plug it back in. This sometimes clears temporary glitches. If the problem persists, the control board might be failing. Replacing a control board is a delicate task. It involves handling electrical components. It requires matching the correct part number for your specific GE model. I recommend consulting the user manual or a qualified technician for this repair.

## Thermostat and Temperature Sensor Problems

Your GE dishwasher relies on accurate temperature readings. The thermostat and temperature sensor play key roles here. The temperature sensor monitors the water temperature inside the tub. It sends this data to the control board. The control board uses this information to ensure water is hot enough for effective cleaning. It also helps manage the heating element.

If the temperature sensor fails, it might send incorrect readings. For example, it could report that the water is never reaching the desired temperature. The control board then tries to heat the water continuously. This causes the heating element to stay on. The wash cycle then never completes. This can result in your GE dishwasher keeps running. It waits for a temperature threshold it never believes it reaches.

### Checking Temperature Components

Diagnosing a faulty thermostat or temperature sensor requires some technical know-how. First, always disconnect power to your dishwasher. The temperature sensor is typically located near the heating element at the bottom of the tub. It might look like a small probe. You can test its resistance with a multimeter. Compare the reading to the manufacturer's specifications. These are usually found in your service manual.

A thermostat, if your model has a separate one, might also be located nearby. A faulty thermostat might prevent the heating element from turning off. This leads to overheating or continuous operation. If the sensor or thermostat provides abnormal readings, it needs replacement. These components ensure the dishwasher progresses through its heating stages correctly. Their failure can seriously disrupt the cycle.

## Electrical and Wiring Issues

Electrical problems can cause a GE dishwasher to keep running. Wires can become loose. They can fray or corrode over time. These issues interrupt the flow of power or signals. The control board relies on steady signals from sensors and switches. It also needs power for all components. If these signals or power supply are intermittent or faulty, the dishwasher can act erratically.

A common electrical issue involves damaged wiring leading to specific components. For example, a frayed wire to the water inlet valve might cause it to stick open. Or, a bad connection to the drain pump could make it run continuously. Sometimes, the issue is not with the component itself. It is with the electrical path leading to it. This can be tricky to pinpoint.

### Inspecting Wiring and Connections

I recommend inspecting the wiring carefully. Always turn off the power at the circuit breaker first. Remove the lower access panel. Look for any visible signs of damage to wires. Check for melted insulation, burn marks, or loose connections. Pay close attention to connections at the control board, motor, pump, and door latch. A loose wire at the door interlock switch, for instance, might prevent the dishwasher from recognizing the door is closed.

Use a multimeter to test for continuity in wires. This helps identify breaks in the circuit. If you find any damaged wiring, it must be repaired or replaced. This is a task that requires caution due to electrical hazards. If you are not comfortable working with electricity, it is best to call a qualified appliance technician. Incorrect wiring repairs can lead to further damage or safety risks.

## User Errors and Cycle Selection

Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one. Your GE dishwasher might seem to keep running due to user error. Modern dishwashers have many cycle options. They also have features like delay start and rinse hold. Misinterpreting these settings can make it seem like the machine is malfunctioning. Before diving into complex repairs, check your settings.

For example, selecting a "SaniWash" or "Heavy Duty" cycle often means a much longer wash time. These cycles include extended heating and wash phases. They might run for three hours or more. If you expect a quick wash, this extended time can appear like continuous running. Similarly, if a "Rinse Hold" option is accidentally activated, the dishwasher will continuously rinse or agitate. It waits for you to select a full wash cycle.

### Reviewing Dishwasher Settings

I suggest you review your selected cycle. Look at the control panel. Is a specific setting illuminated that indicates a prolonged cycle? Consult your [GE dishwasher manual](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-ge-dishwasher) to understand what each cycle entails. For example, some models have a "SmartSense" or "AutoSense" feature. These cycles use sensors to determine the soil level of your dishes. They then adjust the wash time accordingly. If dishes are heavily soiled, this cycle can run for a very long time.

Also, check for any "Delay Start" options. If you accidentally set a delay, the dishwasher will appear idle for a period. It will then start its cycle later. This might give the impression it's continuously running when it finally kicks in. A simple reset by pressing the "Cancel/Drain" button for a few seconds can often clear any current cycle or settings. Then, you can select a new, appropriate cycle.

## When to Call a Professional

Attempting to fix complex dishwasher issues yourself can be challenging. It can also pose safety risks. If you have followed the troubleshooting steps and your GE dishwasher keeps running, it may be time to call a professional appliance technician. They have specialized tools and expertise. They can accurately diagnose difficult problems.

A technician can safely handle electrical components. They can replace faulty control boards or motors. They also have access to genuine GE parts. They ensure the repair is done correctly and safely. Consider the cost of repair versus replacement. For older dishwashers, a major repair might not be cost-effective. A professional can provide an informed opinion.

### Benefits of Professional Repair

Hiring a professional offers several advantages:
*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** They can quickly identify the root cause of the continuous running.
*   **Safe Repair:** Technicians are trained to handle electrical and plumbing components safely.
*   **Warranty:** Most professional repairs come with a warranty on parts and labor.
*   **Time-Saving:** They can often fix the problem faster than a DIY approach.
