## Emmys Red Carpet Start Times and Schedule

Knowing the Emmys Red Carpet start times is crucial for planning your viewing. The exact schedule can vary slightly each year. However, there is a general pattern you can follow. This pattern helps you anticipate when to tune in. Most networks provide their schedule details a few weeks before the actual event.

E! Entertainment Television usually begins its red carpet coverage the earliest. They often start their "Live from E!" special a full two to three hours before the main Emmy Awards ceremony. For example, if the Emmys telecast begins at 8:00 PM ET, E! might start its coverage around 5:00 PM ET or 6:00 PM ET. This early start allows them to capture the very first celebrity arrivals. It also gives them ample time for extensive interviews and fashion commentary. This is ideal if you want to soak in all the pre-show atmosphere.

The official network broadcasting the Emmy Awards will typically have its own pre-show. This usually runs for about an hour or half an hour before the main show. So, if the awards start at 8:00 PM ET, their pre-show might air from 7:00 PM ET to 8:00 PM ET. This coverage tends to be more formal. It focuses heavily on nominees and predictions for the evening's winners. It might also feature network hosts and analysts.

It is important to remember that times are often listed in Eastern Time (ET) or Pacific Time (PT). If you live in a different time zone, you will need to adjust accordingly. For example, if you are on the West Coast, an 8:00 PM ET start time for the main show means 5:00 PM PT. Always double-check your local TV listings or the official Emmys website. This ensures you have the most accurate and up-to-date schedule. I always set a reminder on my phone. This way, I never miss the start of the glamour. Understanding the schedule helps you prepare for the main event and truly appreciate [what are red carpet events](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-are-red-carpet-events) in their entirety.
