Are you staring at your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower, wondering how to get it going? Many of us have been there. Starting a two-stroke engine can seem tricky at first, but it becomes simple with the right steps. My goal is to guide you through the process, ensuring your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower roars to life every time.

We will cover everything from preparing your Stihl BG 56 to troubleshooting common starting issues. You will learn about proper fuel, pre-start checks, and the exact sequence of controls. By the end of this article, you will feel confident starting your Stihl BG 56. Let's make clearing leaves a breeze for you.

### Takeaway

Starting your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower requires a simple, sequential approach. Always ensure fresh, properly mixed fuel. Follow the cold start steps for a dormant engine and the warm start steps for a recently used one. Regular maintenance prevents common starting problems.

### Clear Answer to Starting Your Stihl BG 56

To start your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower, ensure the stop switch is on. Push the primer bulb several times until fuel is visible. Engage the choke lever fully. Pull the starter cord firmly until the engine "coughs" or briefly fires. Disengage the choke to the half-choke position, then pull the cord again until it starts.

## Understanding Your Stihl BG 56 Leaf Blower Controls

Before we begin starting your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower, let's look at its main controls. Knowing where each part is and what it does makes the starting process easier. Familiarity with your equipment is key to safe and efficient operation. I find that a quick check of these components always helps before I even think about pulling the cord.

Your Stihl BG 56 has a few key areas. The stop switch turns the engine off. The primer bulb pushes fuel into the carburetor. The choke lever restricts air flow for cold starts. The throttle trigger controls engine speed.

### Stop Switch

The stop switch is a red or orange button or lever. You must set it to the "run" or "on" position to start the engine. If this switch is off, your Stihl BG 56 will not start, no matter what else you do. I always make sure to check this first.

### Primer Bulb

The primer bulb is a small, clear rubber bulb. You push it to draw fuel from the tank into the carburetor. This helps the engine get fuel for its first few combustion cycles. For a cold engine, you typically press this bulb multiple times until you see fuel fill it.

### Choke Lever

The choke lever is crucial for cold starts. When you engage the choke, it reduces the amount of air entering the carburetor. This creates a richer fuel-to-air mixture, which helps a cold engine ignite. You will move this lever in stages during the starting process.

### Throttle Trigger

The throttle trigger controls the engine's speed. Squeezing it increases the engine's RPMs. You will use this to rev up the engine once it starts. It also helps manage the blower's power during operation.

## Fueling Your Stihl BG 56 Correctly

The right fuel mix is vital for your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower. This model uses a two-stroke engine, which means the fuel requires a specific oil mixture. Using the wrong fuel or an incorrect mix can cause severe engine damage. I have seen engines fail because of bad fuel.

Stihl recommends using high-quality unleaded gasoline with an octane rating of 89 or higher. The fuel must be fresh, preferably less than 30 days old. Stale fuel can lead to starting problems and poor engine performance. Always use fresh fuel for the best results.

### Oil Mix Ratio

For your Stihl BG 56, the fuel-to-oil mix ratio is 50:1. This means you mix 2.56 fluid ounces of Stihl two-stroke engine oil with one gallon of gasoline. Use only high-quality two-stroke engine oil designed for air-cooled engines. Stihl HP Ultra oil is an excellent choice.

It is important to measure accurately. Too little oil causes engine wear. Too much oil can create excessive smoke and carbon buildup. Always mix the fuel in a separate, clean fuel container. Do not mix fuel directly in the leaf blower's tank.

### Fuel Freshness

Always use fresh gasoline. Gasoline starts to break down and oxidize over time, especially when mixed with oil. This creates gums and varnishes that can clog fuel filters and carburetors. If your Stihl BG 56 has been sitting for a while and won't start, old fuel is often the culprit. If you are experiencing general starting issues with any leaf blower, consider checking your fuel. You can learn more about how to [fix a leaf blower that won't start](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-leaf-blower-that-wont-start) by ensuring fresh fuel.

Consider using a fuel stabilizer if you plan to store the fuel for longer periods. This helps prevent fuel degradation. Always store fuel in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Proper fuel storage ensures your Stihl BG 56 starts reliably when you need it.

## The Step-by-Step Starting Process for Stihl BG 56

Now, let's get your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower roaring. I will walk you through the precise steps for a cold start. This process applies when the engine has been off for a long time or is completely cool. Following these steps ensures the engine gets the right fuel-air mixture to ignite properly.

### Cold Start Procedure

1.  **Place the blower on a flat, stable surface.** Make sure the nozzle is clear of obstructions. This provides a safe base for starting. I always do this to avoid accidental movement.
2.  **Move the master control lever to the "Start" position (choke fully engaged).** This usually means moving the lever all the way to the top or the choke symbol.
3.  **Press the primer bulb firmly at least 5-7 times.** You will see fuel filling the bulb and flowing back into the tank. Keep pressing until the bulb is full and no air bubbles are visible. This ensures the carburetor is primed with fuel.
4.  **Hold the blower firmly with one hand.** Place one foot on the blower's base for stability. This stops it from moving when you pull the cord.
5.  **Pull the starter cord slowly a few times until you feel resistance.** Then, give it a firm, quick pull. Do not pull the cord to its full extension. Allow the cord to retract fully each time.
6.  **Listen for the engine to "cough" or make a brief firing sound.** This indicates the engine has received fuel and is ready for the next step. It might not fully start yet.
7.  **Once it "coughs," move the master control lever to the "Half Choke" position.** This is usually the middle position. It reduces the choke to allow more air in.
8.  **Pull the starter cord again firmly until the engine starts.** It should start within one or two pulls in this position.
9.  **Once the engine starts, let it run for a few seconds.** Then, move the master control lever down to the "Run" position (choke off). The engine will now run at idle.
10. **Give the throttle trigger a few short bursts.** This helps clear any excess fuel and allows the engine to warm up. Your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower is now ready to use.

## Restarting a Warm Stihl BG 56 Leaf Blower

If your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower has recently been running and is still warm, the starting process is different. A warm engine does not need as much choke or priming. Trying to start a warm engine with the cold start procedure can flood it. Flooding often makes your leaf blower turn off when you give it gas. You can also review why your [leaf blower turns off when you give it gas](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-leaf-blower-turn-off-when-i-give-it-gas) for more insight.

### Warm Start Procedure

1.  **Ensure the stop switch is in the "Run" position.** This is always the first step for any start.
2.  **Move the master control lever directly to the "Run" position (choke off).** Do not engage the choke or the half-choke. The engine is already warm and does not need the rich fuel mixture.
3.  **Do not press the primer bulb.** The carburetor should still have plenty of fuel from its previous run. Priming it can lead to flooding.
4.  **Hold the blower firmly and pull the starter cord firmly and quickly.** It should start within one or two pulls.
5.  **If the engine does not start after a few pulls,** it might have cooled down more than you expected. In this case, you can try moving the master control lever to the "Half Choke" position and pulling again. Once it starts, immediately move it to "Run."
6.  **If the engine still struggles to start,** or if you suspect it's flooded from previous attempts, let it sit for a few minutes. Then, try starting it with the choke off and pulling the cord a few times to clear the excess fuel.

## Common Stihl BG 56 Starting Problems and Solutions

Even with the correct procedure, your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower might sometimes refuse to start. Do not get discouraged. Many common starting problems have simple solutions. I have encountered most of these myself, and a quick check usually reveals the issue.

Understanding these common problems helps you diagnose and fix your Stihl BG 56 quickly.

### Engine Does Not Fire At All

*   **Check the stop switch:** Ensure it is in the "Run" or "On" position. This is the most common oversight.
*   **No fuel in the tank:** Check fuel level. Refuel with the correct 50:1 mix.
*   **Old or bad fuel:** Drain old fuel. Replace with fresh, properly mixed fuel. Old fuel often causes starting issues.
*   **Clogged fuel filter:** If your blower keeps shutting off, or if it won't start, a clogged fuel filter can be the cause. The fuel filter sits inside the fuel tank. Replace it if it looks dirty. Find more details on why your [leaf blower keeps shutting off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-leaf-blower-keep-shutting-off).
*   **Spark plug issue:** Remove the spark plug. Check if it is fouled, wet, or damaged. Clean it, dry it, or replace it. Ensure the spark plug gap is correct.

### Engine Fires, Then Dies

*   **Choke left on too long:** If the engine starts but quickly dies, you may have left the choke on too long. Move the choke to the "Half Choke" or "Run" position quickly after the first cough.
*   **Not enough priming:** The engine got a little fuel but not enough to keep running. Re-prime the bulb a few more times and try again.
*   **Clogged air filter:** A dirty air filter restricts airflow, causing the engine to starve for air. Remove and clean or replace the air filter. This is a common reason for poor performance.
*   **Spark arrestor screen:** This screen can get clogged with carbon deposits. A clogged screen restricts exhaust flow and can cause the engine to bog down or die. Clean it regularly.

### Engine Flooded

*   **Smell of gas and wet spark plug:** If you smell a strong gas odor and the spark plug is wet with fuel, the engine is likely flooded. This happens from too much priming or too many choke pulls.
*   **To clear a flooded engine:**
    1.  Remove the spark plug.
    2.  Move the master control lever to the "Run" position (choke off).
    3.  Pull the starter cord about 10-15 times to clear excess fuel from the cylinder.
    4.  Clean and dry the spark plug. Reinstall it.
    5.  Attempt to start the blower again with the choke off.

Addressing these common issues will help you get your Stihl BG 56 back to work. Regular maintenance prevents many of these problems.

The air filter prevents dirt and debris from entering the engine. A dirty air filter restricts airflow, making the engine run poorly or not start at all. Your Stihl BG 56 needs clean air to operate efficiently.

*   **Check the air filter frequently, especially in dusty conditions.** Remove the air filter cover. Take out the filter element.
*   **Clean the air filter:** If it is a foam filter, wash it with warm, soapy water, rinse, and let it dry completely. Then, lightly oil it with Stihl filter oil or a few drops of clean engine oil. Squeeze out any excess. If it is a paper filter, tap it gently to remove debris or replace it if it is very dirty.
*   **Replace a damaged or excessively dirty filter.** A clean air filter ensures optimal engine performance and easy starting.

### Spark Plug Checks

The spark plug provides the spark that ignites the fuel-air mixture. A fouled, worn, or incorrectly gapped spark plug can prevent your Stihl BG 56 from starting.

*   **Inspect the spark plug regularly.** Use a spark plug wrench to remove it.
*   **Check for carbon buildup or oil fouling.** Clean any deposits with a wire brush.
*   **Check the gap:** Use a feeler gauge to ensure the gap is set to the manufacturer's specification (usually 0.020 inches or 0.5 mm for Stihl). Adjust if needed.
*   **Replace the spark plug annually or if it shows signs of wear.** A new spark plug often solves starting issues.

### Fuel System Care

Proper fuel system care is crucial for two-stroke engines. This includes the fuel filter and fuel lines.

*   **Fuel Filter:** As mentioned earlier, replace the fuel filter periodically (e.g., annually). It prevents debris from reaching the carburetor.
*   **Fuel Lines:** Inspect fuel lines for cracks, leaks, or hardening. Replace any damaged lines to prevent fuel leaks and air leaks into the fuel system. Air leaks can cause the engine to run lean and possibly fail.
*   **Carburetor Adjustment:** If your Stihl BG 56 still struggles to run smoothly after fuel system maintenance, the carburetor might need adjustment. This often requires specialized tools and knowledge. Consider taking it to a Stihl service center if you suspect a carburetor issue.

### Long-Term Storage

If you plan to store your Stihl BG 56 leaf blower for more than 3 months, prepare it properly.
