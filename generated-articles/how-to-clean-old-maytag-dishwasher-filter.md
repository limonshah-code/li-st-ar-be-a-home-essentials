## Keep Your Old Maytag Dishwasher Running Smoothly: Filter Cleaning Guide

Do you remember when your Maytag dishwasher cleaned dishes perfectly every time? Over time, even the best appliances can start to underperform. If your dishes are coming out gritty, or if your dishwasher smells strange, the filter is likely the culprit. Learning **how to clean old Maytag dishwasher filter** can restore its powerful cleaning ability.

Many people overlook this simple maintenance task. A dirty filter collects food particles, grease, and debris. This build-up prevents water from circulating properly. It also creates an environment for bacteria to grow. This guide will walk you through the process of cleaning your old Maytag dishwasher filter. We will cover everything from locating the filter to putting it back correctly. You can keep your dishes sparkling and extend your appliance's life.

### Takeaway

Keeping your old Maytag dishwasher filter clean is easy and important for its performance. Here are the key steps:

*   Unplug the dishwasher for safety.
*   Locate and remove the filter assembly.
*   Rinse all filter parts under running water.
*   Use a soft brush and dish soap for stubborn debris.
*   Reinstall the clean filter properly.
*   Clean your filter regularly to maintain efficiency.

To clean an old Maytag dishwasher filter, first, disconnect power for safety. Then, locate the filter assembly, usually at the bottom of the tub. Twist or lift to remove its parts. Rinse all components thoroughly under warm, running water, scrubbing gently with a brush and soap to remove trapped food particles and grease. Finally, reassemble and reinstall the clean filter.

### Why Your Maytag Dishwasher Filter Needs Cleaning

Your dishwasher works hard every day. It cleans food scraps off your plates and bowls. Not all food washes down the drain. Some particles get caught in the filter system. This filter acts like a trap. It stops large pieces of food from going into the pump.

Over time, this trapped debris builds up. When the filter gets clogged, water cannot flow freely. This means your dishes do not get as clean. You might see food residue left on them. A dirty filter also causes bad odors. Bacteria can grow on the trapped food. This makes your whole kitchen smell unpleasant. Regular cleaning solves these problems. It keeps your Maytag dishwasher running its best.

#### The Role of the Filter System

The filter system in your Maytag dishwasher is a critical part. It typically has two main sections. There is a coarse filter and a fine filter. The coarse filter catches larger food pieces. Things like bone fragments or fruit pits get caught here. The fine filter catches smaller bits of food. It also traps grease and other tiny particles.

Both filters work together to protect the pump. They also ensure clean water circulates over your dishes. If either filter is blocked, the wash cycle is less effective. Dirty water might spray back onto your dishes. This can leave streaks or grimy residue. Understanding their function helps you see why cleaning is a must.

#### Common Signs of a Clogged Filter

You do not need to wait for a full breakdown to know your filter needs cleaning. There are several clear signs. The most common sign is dirty dishes. You might find small food particles still stuck on plates. Sometimes, dishes feel gritty after a cycle. This suggests poor water circulation.

Another clear sign is a bad smell. If your dishwasher smells like old food, the filter is often the cause. The smell can linger even after a wash cycle finishes. Puddles of water at the bottom of the tub after a cycle can also indicate a blockage. This means water is not draining properly. If you notice any of these issues, it is time to check your filter.

### Getting Ready: Tools and Safety First

Before you start, gather a few simple tools. You probably have most of them in your kitchen already. This preparation makes the cleaning process smooth. It also ensures your safety. I always make sure I have everything ready before I start a task like this.

Safety is important when working with any appliance. Dishwashers involve electricity and water. Always prioritize turning off the power. This prevents any accidental shocks or injuries. Taking a few moments to prepare means you can clean your filter safely and effectively.

#### Essential Tools for Cleaning

You do not need special tools for this job. Most homes have what is necessary. Here is a list of items I find useful:

*   **Dish soap:** A mild dish soap is perfect for cutting grease.
*   **Soft brush:** An old toothbrush or a small scrubbing brush works well. This helps dislodge stuck-on bits.
*   **Paper towels or old cloth:** These are good for wiping up spills. They can also clean the filter housing area.
*   **Gloves (optional but recommended):** If you prefer not to touch food debris, wear a pair of rubber gloves.

Having these items ready saves you time. It also makes the job less messy. You can complete the cleaning quickly and efficiently.

#### Prioritizing Safety: Power Disconnection

This step is critical. Before you touch anything inside your dishwasher, turn off its power. You can do this in two ways:

1.  **Unplug the appliance:** Pull the power cord directly from the wall outlet. This is the simplest and safest method if the cord is accessible.
2.  **Turn off the circuit breaker:** Go to your home's main electrical panel. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position. This ensures no power reaches the appliance.

Always double-check that the power is off. I usually try to press a button on the dishwasher. If it does not light up, I know it is safe. This simple step prevents electrical hazards. It protects both you and your Maytag dishwasher.

### Finding and Removing Your Maytag Dishwasher Filter

Locating the filter in an old Maytag dishwasher is usually straightforward. Most models have the filter at the bottom of the wash tub. It is designed to be accessible for regular cleaning. Once you find it, removal is typically a simple twist or lift. Knowing the exact method helps avoid damage.

Different Maytag models might have slight variations in filter design. However, the basic principle remains similar. I remember the first time I tried to find mine. It took a moment, but then it was obvious. This section will guide you through finding and removing the filter with ease. If you're looking for general help on how to get your Maytag dishwasher filter out, you can find more information here: [How to Get Maytag Dishwasher Filter Out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-maytag-dishwasher-filter-out).

#### Identifying the Filter Location

Open your Maytag dishwasher door completely. Look down at the bottom of the tub. You will see a round or cylindrical part in the center or slightly to one side. This is usually the filter assembly. It might be covered by the lower spray arm. In some older models, you might see a flat screen instead.

Many Maytag models feature a two-part filter system. There is a larger, outer cylindrical mesh. Inside this, there is a finer mesh cup or screen. Sometimes, the filter sits below the lower spray arm. You may need to remove the lower spray arm first. This allows full access to the filter.

#### Step-by-Step Removal Process

Once you locate the filter, here is how to remove it:

1.  **Remove the lower spray arm (if necessary):** Some Maytag models require you to remove the lower spray arm first. This usually involves unscrewing a nut or simply lifting it off a central post. Look for a central nut or just pull it straight up.
2.  **Twist the outer filter:** Grab the cylindrical outer filter. Gently twist it counter-clockwise. It should unlock and lift out easily.
3.  **Lift out the inner filter:** Once the outer filter is out, you can usually lift the inner, finer mesh filter straight up. This part often looks like a small cup or basket.
4.  **Inspect for debris:** As you remove the parts, notice how much food debris is trapped. This will confirm why your dishwasher was not cleaning well.

It is important to be gentle. Filters are made of plastic. For a comprehensive guide on how to clean your Maytag dishwasher filter, you can refer to [How To Clean Your Dishwasher Filter Maytag](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-dishwasher-filter-maytag). This helps you handle them without causing any damage.

### The Cleaning Process: Scrubbing Away the Grime

Now comes the actual cleaning. This is where you get rid of all the trapped food and grease. It might look a little gross at first. But a clean filter will make a huge difference. I always feel satisfied seeing all the gunk wash away.

This part of the process is straightforward. It just requires a little elbow grease. Using the right tools makes it much easier. You will see your filter go from dirty to sparkling clean.

#### Rinsing and Soaking the Components

Start by rinsing each filter component under warm, running water. Hold them under the faucet. Let the water wash away as much loose debris as possible. You will be surprised how much comes off just with water.

For stubborn, dried-on food or grease, a short soak can help. Fill a small basin with warm water. Add a few drops of dish soap. Place the filter parts into the soapy water. Let them soak for 10-15 minutes. This softens the grime. It makes it easier to scrub off later. Soaking is a great first step.

#### Gentle Scrubbing for Tough Build-Up

After rinsing or soaking, it is time to scrub. Use your soft brush or an old toothbrush. Apply a small amount of dish soap to the brush. Gently scrub all surfaces of the filter. Pay close attention to the mesh screens. Food particles often get trapped in these tiny holes.

Make sure to clean both the coarse and fine filters thoroughly. Do not use anything abrasive. Abrasive cleaners or harsh brushes can damage the filter mesh. This damage can prevent it from working properly. Continue scrubbing until all visible debris is gone. Rinse the filter parts again under clean running water. Ensure no soap residue remains. This careful cleaning ensures the best results.

### Reassembly and Testing Your Clean Maytag Filter

Once your filter is sparkling clean, it is time to put it back. Reassembling the filter correctly is just as important as cleaning it. If it is not seated properly, your dishwasher might not perform its best. It might even leak or make strange noises. I always make sure each part clicks into place.

After reassembly, a quick test run confirms everything is working. This final step gives you peace of mind. You will know your hard work paid off. Your Maytag dishwasher will be ready to clean dishes like new again.

#### Putting the Filter Back in Place

Follow these steps to reinstall your Maytag dishwasher filter:

1.  **Insert the inner filter:** Place the fine mesh filter back into its designated spot. It should slide in easily. Make sure it sits flush.
2.  **Position the outer filter:** Align the outer cylindrical filter over the inner filter. There are usually alignment marks or grooves. These guide you to the correct position.
3.  **Twist to lock:** Gently push down and twist the outer filter clockwise. You should feel it lock into place. It might make a small click. Make sure it is secure and cannot be easily lifted out.
4.  **Reinstall the lower spray arm (if removed):** If you took off the lower spray arm, place it back onto its central post. Tighten any nuts or push it down until it snaps into place. Make sure it spins freely.

Proper reassembly is key for your dishwasher's performance. For detailed steps on putting the filter back in, see [How To Put Dishwasher Filter Back In](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in).

#### Testing the Dishwasher

After the filter is reinstalled, you can test your Maytag dishwasher.

1.  **Restore power:** Plug the dishwasher back in. Or, flip the circuit breaker back to the "on" position.
2.  **Run a short cycle:** Choose a light wash cycle. Or, simply run a rinse-only cycle. This helps confirm the filter is working. Listen for any unusual noises. Look for leaks around the filter area.
3.  **Inspect dishes:** After the cycle, check if the dishes are cleaner. There should be no residue. The dishwasher should also smell fresh.

If you encounter issues like your dishwasher not cleaning as expected, or if you notice water problems, consider checking for a clogged filter or other drainage issues. Sometimes, a full filter can cause water to remain at the bottom of the tub; for more insights on this, you can visit [Why Is My Dishwasher Filter Full of Water?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-dishwasher-filter-full-of-water). If your Maytag dishwasher is still not cleaning properly, there might be other reasons.

### Beyond the Filter: Comprehensive Dishwasher Care

Cleaning the filter is a vital part of dishwasher maintenance. But it is not the only thing you can do. A truly clean dishwasher performs better and lasts longer. Regular care prevents many common issues. I like to think of it as a small investment in my appliance's longevity.

Taking a few extra steps will keep your Maytag dishwasher in top shape. This includes routine cleaning of other parts. It also involves using the right cleaning products. A well-maintained dishwasher saves you money. It also keeps your dishes sparkling clean every time.

#### Cleaning Other Dishwasher Components

The filter is a major catch-all, but other parts also get dirty.

*   **Spray Arms:** The spray arms have tiny holes. These can get clogged with mineral deposits or food particles. Periodically remove the spray arms. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear the holes. Rinse them thoroughly before putting them back.
*   **Door Gasket:** The rubber gasket around the dishwasher door can collect grime and mold. Wipe it down regularly with a damp cloth and a little vinegar. This prevents odors and leaks.
*   **Interior Walls:** Food particles and soap scum can build up on the interior walls. Run an empty cycle with a cup of white vinegar. Place it on the top rack. This helps remove mineral deposits and deodorize the interior.

Regularly cleaning these parts complements filter maintenance. This ensures your dishwasher runs at peak efficiency.

#### Using Dishwasher Cleaners and Descalers

Sometimes, deep cleaning is needed. Dishwasher cleaners are designed for this. They break down grease and hard water deposits. You can find these at most grocery or hardware stores. Follow the product instructions. Often, you simply place a packet in the dishwasher and run an empty cycle.

Descalers are specifically for hard water buildup. If you live in an area with hard water, these are very helpful. Mineral deposits can coat the heating element and spray arms. This reduces efficiency. Using a descaler once every few months can prevent this. It extends the life of your Maytag dishwasher.

### When and How Often to Clean Your Maytag Dishwasher Filter

How often should you clean your Maytag dishwasher filter? This is a common question. The answer depends on how often you use your dishwasher and what you wash. For me, a regular schedule works best. It prevents major build-ups. This proactive approach saves time and effort in the long run.

Establishing a routine ensures your dishwasher always performs well. It also helps you catch issues early. A clean filter is a happy filter. And a happy filter means clean dishes.

#### Recommended Cleaning Frequency

Most experts recommend cleaning your dishwasher filter at least once a month. This is a good general guideline. However, you might need to clean it more often if:

*   **You use your dishwasher frequently:** If you run it daily or multiple times a day, clean the filter every 2-3 weeks.
*   **You wash dishes with heavy food residue:** If you often put heavily soiled dishes without pre-rinsing, food particles accumulate faster. Clean the filter every 2-3 weeks in this case.
*   **You notice signs of a clogged filter:** If you see dirty dishes, bad odors, or standing water, clean the filter immediately.

Being aware of these factors helps you adjust your cleaning schedule. For more detailed guidance on how often to clean your dishwasher filter, read [How Often Should You Clean Your Dishwasher Filter?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-your-dishwasher-filter).

#### Tips for Maintaining Filter Cleanliness Between Deep Cleans

While regular deep cleaning is important, a few habits can help. These keep your filter cleaner between sessions:

*   **Scrape plates:** Remove large food particles from plates before loading them. This significantly reduces the amount of debris caught by the filter.
*   **Avoid large bones or fruit pits:** These items are particularly problematic. They can clog the filter quickly and are hard to remove.
*   **Run a rinse cycle:** If you are not running a full wash immediately, a quick rinse cycle can flush some loose debris. This prevents it from drying onto the filter.
*   **Use enough detergent:** Too little detergent can lead to food residue clinging to dishes and filters. Too much can cause excessive suds.

These simple habits make a big difference. They extend the time between deep cleans. They also ensure your old Maytag dishwasher works efficiently every day.

### Troubleshooting Common Dishwasher Issues Related to the Filter

Even with regular cleaning, sometimes issues arise. A dirty or improperly installed filter can cause various problems. Knowing how to troubleshoot these can save you a service call. It helps you quickly identify if the filter is the root cause. I find that most dishwasher problems trace back to the filter or drainage.

Understanding these common issues helps you react quickly. It also allows you to enjoy consistently clean dishes. A little knowledge goes a long way in appliance care.

#### Dishes Not Getting Clean

This is the most common sign of a dirty filter. If your dishes come out with food particles, streaks, or a gritty feel, the filter is likely blocked. The water cannot circulate properly. It cannot spray over all the dishes effectively.

**Solution:** Check and clean your Maytag dishwasher filter thoroughly. If the filter is clean, also inspect the spray arm holes. Make sure they are not clogged. Ensure you are using enough detergent and that the water temperature is hot enough.

#### Bad Odors from the Dishwasher

A foul smell coming from your dishwasher is a strong indicator of trapped food debris. This food breaks down and creates a moldy or sour odor. The smell can permeate your kitchen. It is unpleasant.

**Solution:** Remove and clean your filter immediately. Also, check the drain area for any lodged food. You can run an empty cycle with white vinegar. Place a cup of vinegar in the top rack. This helps neutralize odors and sanitize the interior.

#### Standing Water in the Dishwasher

If you open your dishwasher and find a pool of water at the bottom, there is a drainage issue. While it might be a pump problem, a clogged filter is a very common culprit. The filter prevents water from reaching the drain pump effectively.

**Solution:** Clean the filter first. Ensure no large food pieces are blocking the filter housing. Also, check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. Make sure your garbage disposal (if connected to the dishwasher drain) is clear. If these steps do not work, you might have a more serious drainage problem or pump issue.

### Maximizing the Lifespan of Your Old Maytag Dishwasher

An old Maytag dishwasher can last for many years with proper care. It is a reliable appliance. Regular maintenance, especially filter cleaning, prevents wear and tear. It also helps avoid costly repairs. I believe in getting the most out of my appliances.

Thinking about the long term helps you make smart choices. A little effort today can save you a lot of trouble tomorrow. Caring for your old Maytag dishwasher means it will continue serving your family for years to come.

#### The Link Between Filter Cleaning and Appliance Longevity

A clean filter protects crucial internal parts of your dishwasher. A clogged filter makes the pump work harder. This extra strain can shorten the pump's life. It can also lead to premature failure of other components. The motor might overheat. Or the spray arms might not get enough pressure.

Regular filter cleaning ensures smooth operation. It reduces stress on the pump and motor. This simple task is one of the most effective ways to extend your dishwasher's lifespan. It helps maintain optimal water pressure. This means your dishes get cleaner without overworking the machine.

#### When to Consider Professional Help or Replacement

While cleaning your filter solves many problems, sometimes issues are more complex. If you have cleaned the filter and tried basic troubleshooting, but problems persist, consider these options:

*   **Persistent Leaks:** If your dishwasher is leaking, and it is not due to a bad door gasket or improper filter installation, professional help might be needed.
*   **Strange Noises:** Loud grinding, banging, or humming noises could indicate a motor or pump issue.
*   **Complete Failure to Start or Fill:** If the dishwasher does not turn on or fill with water, the problem is beyond simple filter cleaning.
*   **Age of Appliance:** Even with perfect care, appliances have a lifespan. If your Maytag dishwasher is very old and frequently breaking down, replacing it might be more cost-effective than continuous repairs.

Before calling a professional, remember to rule out the filter. It is often the easiest and cheapest fix. If problems continue, consider a professional diagnosis. They can advise if a repair is feasible or if it is time for an upgrade.

### FAQs About Cleaning Old Maytag Dishwasher Filters

Here are some common questions I hear about cleaning Maytag dishwasher filters.

#### Can I put my Maytag dishwasher filter in the dishwasher to clean it?

No, do not put your Maytag dishwasher filter back into the dishwasher for cleaning. The dishwasher itself cannot effectively clean its own filter. You need to remove the filter manually. Then, clean it thoroughly by hand under running water with a brush and dish soap.

#### What happens if I never clean my Maytag dishwasher filter?

If you never clean your Maytag dishwasher filter, it will become clogged with food particles and grease. This will lead to dishes not getting clean, unpleasant odors, and potentially poor drainage or standing water in the tub. The dishwasher's pump will also work harder, possibly shortening its lifespan.

#### How do I know if my Maytag dishwasher has a removable filter?

Most modern Maytag dishwashers, especially those made in the last 15-20 years, have removable filters. Look at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. If you see a cylindrical or round mesh component, usually in the center or front-right, it is likely a removable filter. Older models might have a self-cleaning filter system instead.

#### How often should I replace my Maytag dishwasher filter?

You usually do not need to replace your Maytag dishwasher filter unless it is physically damaged. Regular cleaning keeps it functional. If the mesh is torn, cracked, or severely warped, then replacement might be necessary. Otherwise, focus on consistent cleaning rather than replacement.

#### Can a dirty filter cause my Maytag dishwasher to leak?

Yes, a severely clogged filter can indirectly contribute to leaks. A blockage can cause water to back up or not drain properly. This might lead to water overflowing or leaking from the door seal if the water level gets too high. Always check your filter first if you notice leaks.

#### What kind of soap should I use to clean the filter?

Use mild dish soap or liquid detergent to clean your Maytag dishwasher filter. Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or bleach. These can damage the plastic or metal components of the filter. Gentle dish soap is effective at cutting through grease and food residue without causing damage.
