It uses a combination of hot water, cleaning solution, and powerful suction to lift dirt from deep within carpet fibers. I know many people seek it out for its ability to deliver results that mimic professional cleaning services. Understanding that this is a Bissell product helps in finding where it is sold. You can always start your search directly with the manufacturer.

This specific model number, 86T3, confirms you are looking for the professional-grade version. It is not a generic "big green" cleaner. The "Pro" in its name signifies its enhanced features and durability compared to standard home carpet cleaners. Many homeowners and small businesses choose this model for its reliability and strong cleaning power.

## Major Online Retailers for the Big Green Pro 86t3

Online shopping has become a primary way for many people to buy home appliances. The Bissell Big Green Pro Carpet Cleaner 86T3 is widely available through various major online retailers. These platforms offer convenience, competitive pricing, and the ability to compare different sellers. I often start my search here when looking for specific products.

Amazon is typically one of the first places to check for popular items like the Big Green Pro 86T3. They usually have multiple sellers, which can lead to competitive pricing and fast shipping options. You can also read many customer reviews on Amazon, which helps in making an informed decision about the cleaner's performance and reliability. I find reviews incredibly helpful before making a purchase.

Walmart.com and Target.com are also strong contenders for purchasing the Big Green Pro 86T3. These retailers often match or beat prices from other online stores. They also provide options for in-store pickup, which can be convenient if you need the cleaner quickly and prefer not to wait for shipping. Checking their websites regularly can help you catch sales events.

The official Bissell website, Bissell.com, is another crucial online source. Buying directly from the manufacturer ensures you receive a genuine product with full warranty support. Bissell.com often has exclusive offers or bundles, such as including cleaning solutions with the machine. I recommend checking their site for the latest pricing and any ongoing promotions. Sometimes, manufacturers offer direct support that third-party sellers cannot.

Beyond these giants, you might also find the Big Green Pro 86T3 on websites like BestBuy.com, HomeDepot.com, and Lowes.com. These sites specialize in home goods and appliances. They may offer their own financing options or extended warranty plans. Exploring these different online avenues gives you the best chance of finding the Big Green Pro 86T3 at a price and with shipping terms that suit your needs. Remember to compare shipping costs and estimated delivery times across different platforms.

## Finding the Big Green Pro 86t3 at Physical Stores

While online shopping offers convenience, some people prefer to buy high-value items like the Bissell Big Green Pro Carpet Cleaner 86T3 in person. Visiting a physical store allows you to see the product, ask questions, and take it home immediately. I understand the appeal of a tangible shopping experience, especially for larger appliances.

Major electronics and home improvement stores are good places to start your search. Best Buy, for example, often carries a range of home appliances, including carpet cleaners. You might find the Big Green Pro 86T3 on display, allowing you to gauge its size and build quality. Sales associates can also provide assistance and answer any specific questions you have about its features or operation.

Home Depot and Lowe's are also strong contenders. These stores specialize in home improvement and often stock heavy-duty cleaning equipment. They cater to both DIY enthusiasts and professionals, so a professional-grade carpet cleaner like the Big Green Pro fits right into their inventory. These stores may also offer rental options for carpet cleaners, which can be a good test drive if you are unsure about purchasing. You can find more details on using a carpet cleaner vacuum if you opt for a purchase or rental.

Walmart and Target, while primarily general merchandise stores, also have substantial home goods sections. You might find the Bissell Big Green Pro 86T3 available in larger Supercenter or SuperTarget locations. Stock levels can vary by store, so it is a good idea to check their website for in-store availability before making a trip. This helps you avoid a wasted journey.

When shopping at physical stores, consider calling ahead to confirm stock. Product availability can fluctuate, especially for popular models. Asking about any ongoing sales or special offers is also a smart move. Taking the item home directly means you avoid shipping delays and potential damage during transit. This immediate gratification can be a significant benefit for many buyers.

## Key Features of the Bissell Big Green Pro 86t3

The Bissell Big Green Pro Carpet Cleaner 86T3 has earned its "Pro" designation for several reasons. Understanding its key features helps you see why so many people seek out this particular model. It is designed to offer a deep clean that goes beyond what typical household carpet cleaners can achieve. I find its specifications impressive for a consumer-grade machine.

One of its standout features is its powerful suction and large brush rolls. These elements work together to agitate carpet fibers and extract embedded dirt and stains effectively. This powerful action is crucial for refreshing high-traffic areas and removing stubborn spots. The machine's design ensures maximum dirt removal with fewer passes.

The Big Green Pro 86T3 also boasts a large capacity water tank. This means you can clean larger areas without constantly needing to refill the clean water tank or empty the dirty water tank. This saves significant time and effort, making the cleaning process much more efficient. Many users appreciate not having to pause their cleaning session frequently.

It also uses hot water extraction technology. The machine does not heat the water itself, but it is designed to work with hot tap water, which helps to activate cleaning solutions and break down dirt more effectively. This feature contributes significantly to its deep cleaning capabilities. Using hot water and the correct cleaning solution is key to achieving the best results. You can learn more about this process. [Can I Use Hot Water and Carpet Cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-hot-water-and-carpet-cleaner).

The durable construction of the Big Green Pro 86T3 is another major selling point. It is built to withstand frequent and heavy use, making it suitable for homes with pets, children, or commercial environments requiring regular deep cleaning. Its sturdy design means it is a long-term investment. Many people also find that this cleaner is versatile enough to handle different types of cleaning tasks. For example, it can clean rugs effectively. [Can You Clean Rugs with a Carpet Cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-clean-rugs-with-a-carpet-cleaner). These combined features make the Big Green Pro 86T3 a favorite among those who prioritize powerful, efficient, and reliable carpet care.

## Rental vs. Purchase: Is the Big Green Pro 86t3 Right for You?

Deciding whether to buy a Bissell Big Green Pro Carpet Cleaner 86T3 or simply rent a carpet cleaner is a common dilemma. The best choice depends on your specific cleaning needs and how often you plan to use the machine. I've seen many people weigh these options carefully before committing.

Renting a carpet cleaner is a good option if you only need to deep clean your carpets once or twice a year. Rental services are available at various locations, including some grocery stores, hardware stores like Home Depot and Lowe's, and even specialized rental centers. This approach saves you the upfront cost of purchasing a machine. It also eliminates concerns about storage, maintenance, and repairs. If you only have one small area or need a quick spot clean, this is a sensible choice. You might even be looking for information about [Who Sells a Small Carpet Shampooer for a Boat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/who-sells-a-small-carpet-shampooer-for-a-boat) for specific, limited use cases.

However, if you have a large home with extensive carpeting, pets, or children, buying the Big Green Pro 86T3 might be a more economical and convenient solution in the long run. Frequent deep cleaning can quickly make rental costs add up. Owning the machine allows you to clean whenever an accident happens or whenever your carpets need refreshing, without scheduling a rental or driving to a store. This immediate access is a huge benefit for proactive cleaning.

The Big Green Pro 86T3 is built for durability and performance, offering professional-level results that often exceed those of common rental units. If you are aiming for business-level cleanliness, owning a powerful machine like this is a solid investment. You might even find it useful to consider how businesses get their carpets cleaned when thinking about its professional capabilities. [How to Get Business Carpet Cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-business-carpet-cleaner). Consider the frequency of use, the size of your carpeted areas, and your budget before making your final decision. Sometimes, the convenience and quality of owning a top-tier cleaner outweigh the initial cost.

## Smart Buying Tips for Your Big Green Pro 86t3

Purchasing a significant appliance like the Bissell Big Green Pro Carpet Cleaner 86T3 requires some smart shopping strategies. You want to ensure you get the best deal and a product that meets your expectations. I always recommend doing a bit of research before hitting the "buy" button.

First, compare prices across different retailers. As I mentioned earlier, the Big Green Pro 86T3 is sold by Bissell directly, and by major online and physical stores. Prices can vary, especially during sales events or holidays. Use price comparison websites or open multiple tabs in your browser to check current listings. This simple step can save you a good amount of money.

Second, read customer reviews and ratings carefully. While overall ratings are helpful, pay attention to specific comments about the machine's performance, durability, and any common issues. Reviews can offer practical insights that product descriptions might miss. Look for patterns in feedback, both positive and negative, to get a balanced view.

Third, investigate the warranty and return policy. A strong warranty protects your investment in case of manufacturing defects. Understand the terms, including how long the warranty lasts and what it covers. Also, know the retailer's return policy. This is important if the machine arrives damaged or if it does not meet your expectations. Returning a large item can be complicated, so being prepared helps.

Finally, consider purchasing during major sales seasons. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and other holiday sales are excellent times to find discounts on large appliances. Even Amazon Prime Day or specific retailer anniversary sales can offer good deals. Signing up for email newsletters from Bissell or your preferred retailers might also alert you to upcoming promotions. Being patient can lead to significant savings.

## Maintaining and Maximizing Your Big Green Pro Investment

Once you own the Bissell Big Green Pro Carpet Cleaner 86T3, proper maintenance is crucial to ensure its longevity and continued high performance. This machine is a valuable investment, and taking good care of it will allow it to serve you well for many years. I always stress the importance of following manufacturer guidelines for all appliances.

After each use, make sure to thoroughly empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks. Leaving dirty water in the tank can lead to mildew and odors, which you definitely do not want in your cleaning machine. Rinsing helps prevent residue buildup and keeps the machine fresh for its next use. It also helps preserve the integrity of the tanks themselves.

Regularly clean the brush rolls and nozzle. Carpet fibers, pet hair, and debris can get tangled in the brush rolls, reducing their effectiveness. Use a pair of scissors to carefully cut away any hair or threads. The nozzle can also get clogged, so check it for obstructions and clean as needed to maintain optimal suction. This prevents blockages that can hinder the cleaner's performance.

Only use cleaning solutions recommended by Bissell or those specifically formulated for carpet extractors. Using improper solutions, like too much laundry detergent, can damage the machine's internal components, leave sticky residues on your carpet, or void your warranty. While some people consider using alternative solutions, it is better to stick to the manufacturer's recommendations. You can find more information about the right solutions.

Store your Big Green Pro 86T3 in a clean, dry place. Protecting it from extreme temperatures and humidity helps preserve its electronic components and seals. Proper storage also prevents dust buildup, keeping the machine ready for immediate use. Following these simple maintenance steps will help you maximize your investment in the Bissell Big Green Pro, ensuring it continues to deliver powerful cleaning results every time.

## Understanding Solutions and Accessories for the Big Green Pro

Getting the most out of your Bissell Big Green Pro Carpet Cleaner 86T3 involves more than just the machine itself. The cleaning solutions and accessories you use play a critical role in achieving the best possible results. I always remind people that the right solution makes a huge difference in cleaning power.

Bissell offers a range of proprietary cleaning formulas specifically designed for their Big Green machines. These solutions are formulated to work effectively with the machine's spray and suction system, breaking down dirt and stains without leaving behind excessive residue. Using Bissell-brand solutions often ensures optimal performance and also keeps your warranty intact. They have specific solutions for pet stains, general cleaning, and even formulas designed to be more environmentally friendly. You can check if a certain cleaner is safe.

Beyond the standard cleaning solution, consider specialized formulas for pet messes, strong odors, or heavy traffic areas. These targeted solutions can enhance the cleaning power of your Big Green Pro for specific challenges. Always follow the mixing instructions on the solution bottle. Using too much solution can lead to sticky carpets that attract dirt faster, while too little may not clean effectively.

The Big Green Pro 86T3 often comes with an upholstery tool, but you can also purchase additional attachments. These accessories can expand the versatility of your cleaner. For example, a specialized crevice tool can help clean stairs or tight corners that the main floor nozzle cannot reach. This versatility extends beyond carpets; you might be surprised at what else a carpet cleaner can handle.

Before you begin cleaning, vacuum the area thoroughly to remove loose dirt and debris. This step prevents the cleaner from pushing around loose particles. Pretreating heavily soiled areas or stubborn stains with a suitable spot cleaner before using the Big Green Pro can also significantly improve your results. The combination of the right machine, appropriate solutions, and proper technique will ensure your carpets look their best.
