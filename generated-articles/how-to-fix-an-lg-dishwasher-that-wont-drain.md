## Understanding Why Your LG Dishwasher Won't Drain

Your LG dishwasher not draining is a common issue. Several factors can cause this problem. Understanding these reasons helps you diagnose the issue effectively. Most drainage problems stem from blockages or mechanical failures.

One common culprit is food debris. Food particles can build up in the dishwasher's filter system. This accumulation prevents water from exiting properly. Grease and grime also contribute to these clogs. Another potential issue involves the drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. Kinks or blockages in this hose stop water flow.

Sometimes, the air gap on your sink can be the problem. An air gap prevents dirty drain water from flowing back into your clean water supply. If it gets clogged, water cannot drain from the dishwasher. Lastly, mechanical failures can occur. The drain pump, responsible for pushing water out, might be faulty. This understanding helps you proceed with troubleshooting. You can often fix these problems yourself. If you are experiencing water remaining in the tub, understanding [why does my LG dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) can help.

### Food Debris and Clogs

Food debris is a frequent cause of drainage issues. Small food particles, grease, and soap residue collect over time. They accumulate in the filter or the sump area at the bottom of the dishwasher. This buildup creates a barrier, stopping water from draining away.

Regular cleaning prevents this problem. If you notice standing water, a clogged filter is a likely cause. It is usually the first place to check. Clearing this debris is a simple fix.

### Air Gap Issues

An air gap is a small cylindrical device on your sink counter. It connects the dishwasher's drain hose to the main drain line. Its job is to prevent dirty water from siphoning back into the dishwasher. If this component becomes clogged, water cannot flow through it.

Food particles or grease can block the air gap. This blockage makes your LG dishwasher unable to drain. Checking this component is a quick troubleshooting step.

## Safety First: Preparing for LG Dishwasher Troubleshooting

Before you start any repair work on your LG dishwasher, prioritize safety. Working with appliances involves electricity and water. Ignoring safety steps can lead to injury or damage. I always make sure the power is off first.

The most critical step is disconnecting the power supply. Find your home's circuit breaker box. Locate the breaker that controls power to your kitchen or specifically to the dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position. This prevents accidental electrocution. Next, shut off the water supply to the dishwasher. There is usually a shut-off valve under the sink. Turn this valve clockwise until it is closed. Having the right tools ready also makes the job smoother. You will need towels, a bucket, and screwdrivers. Preparing correctly ensures a safe and efficient repair process.

### Disconnecting Power

Always turn off the power before touching your dishwasher. Go to your home's main electrical panel. Find the circuit breaker labeled for the kitchen or dishwasher. Flip it to the OFF position.

This step protects you from electric shock. Never skip this vital safety measure. Double-check that the dishwasher has no power before proceeding.

### Protecting Your Floors

Water often remains in a dishwasher that won't drain. When you start disassembling parts, this water can spill out. Place old towels around the base of the dishwasher. Use a shallow pan or bucket to catch any water.

This protects your flooring from water damage. It also makes cleanup much easier. Be prepared for some water to escape during the process.

## Clearing the Filter and Sump Area of Your LG Dishwasher

The most frequent reason an LG dishwasher won't drain is a clogged filter. Over time, food particles and grease accumulate in this area. This buildup prevents water from flowing freely into the drain. Cleaning the filter and sump area is a simple yet crucial maintenance task.

To start, open your dishwasher door and remove the lower dish rack. Look at the bottom of the tub. You will see the filter assembly. LG dishwashers typically have a two-part filter system: a coarse filter and a fine filter. Turn the top cylinder of the fine filter counter-clockwise to unlock it. Lift out both filter parts. Take them to your sink. Rinse them under warm running water. Use an old brush or sponge to scrub away any stuck-on food or grease. I sometimes use a little dish soap to help break down stubborn residue. While the filters are out, inspect the sump area, which is the basin beneath where the filters sit. Remove any visible debris. This could include broken glass, food scraps, or small plastic items. Once clean, reassemble the filters and place them back into the dishwasher, locking them into place. For a more detailed guide, you can learn [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain) effectively.

### Step-by-Step Filter Cleaning

1.  **Locate the filter:** It's at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Remove the lower rack.
2.  **Disassemble:** Turn the cylindrical top filter counter-clockwise and lift. Remove the flat bottom filter.
3.  **Clean thoroughly:** Rinse both parts under warm water. Use a brush to remove food particles and grease.
4.  **Inspect sump:** Look into the well beneath the filter. Remove any large debris.
5.  **Reassemble:** Place the flat filter first, then the cylindrical filter. Turn it clockwise to lock.

## Inspecting the Dishwasher Drain Hose for Obstructions

If cleaning the filter did not resolve the drainage issue, the next place to check is the drain hose. The drain hose connects your LG dishwasher to your kitchen's plumbing system. It carries the dirty water away. This hose can become kinked or clogged over time, preventing water from draining.

Start by pulling the dishwasher slightly away from the wall, if possible, to access the back. Look for the corrugated plastic hose. This is your drain hose. Check its entire length for any obvious kinks or bends. A kink will restrict water flow significantly. If you find a kink, gently straighten it out. Sometimes, the hose can become clogged internally with food debris or grease buildup. To check for this, you may need to disconnect the hose from both the dishwasher and the sink drain or garbage disposal. Place a bucket underneath before disconnecting to catch any residual water. Once disconnected, you can try to flush water through it or use a straightened coat hanger to dislodge any blockages. Be careful not to puncture the hose. Reconnect the hose securely once cleared. Ensure it has a proper high loop if required by your local plumbing codes. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. You can find more detailed instructions on [how to clear dishwasher drain line](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clear-dishwasher-drain-line).

### Checking for Kinks

A kink in the drain hose stops water flow. First, look behind the dishwasher. Find the drain hose, usually a flexible plastic tube. Ensure it runs smoothly without sharp bends.

Straighten any kinks you find. Pull the dishwasher out slightly if needed. This simple check can often fix your drainage problem.

### Clearing Internal Clogs

Internal clogs need more effort. Disconnect the drain hose from both ends. Have a bucket ready for water. Use a garden hose to flush water through it.

You can also use a plumber's snake or a straightened coat hanger carefully. Push it through the hose to break up clogs. Reattach the hose securely when it is clear.

## Checking the Air Gap and Garbage Disposal Connection

Beyond the dishwasher itself, the air gap and garbage disposal are common points of failure for drainage. These components are part of your kitchen's overall plumbing system. If either is blocked or malfunctioning, your LG dishwasher will not drain properly. It is crucial to check these external connections.

First, locate your air gap. It is a small chrome cylinder on your kitchen sink countertop, near the faucet. If you have one, remove its cover. Inspect the inside for any food particles or debris. Use a small brush or a paper towel to clear any obstructions. Sometimes, the hose connecting the air gap to the garbage disposal or drain can be clogged. Disconnect this hose and clear it if necessary. Second, consider your garbage disposal. If your dishwasher drains into the garbage disposal, it is vital that the disposal is clear. Run the garbage disposal for about 30 seconds with cold water before starting your dishwasher cycle. This ensures it is empty and ready to receive water from the dishwasher. A full or clogged disposal will prevent proper drainage. If you recently installed a new garbage disposal, ensure the knock-out plug was removed. This plug blocks the dishwasher drain inlet. Checking these components can often solve the problem quickly. Learning [how to get the dishwasher to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain) often involves these external checks.

### Air Gap Inspection

Locate the air gap on your sink counter. It is usually a small metal or plastic cap. Remove the cap. Check inside for any food debris. Clear any blockages with a small tool or brush.

Ensure the hoses connected to the air gap are also clear. These hoses can also get clogged. A clear air gap allows proper drainage.

### Garbage Disposal Checks

If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, ensure it's empty. Run the disposal with cold water for a minute. This clears any food waste. A full disposal blocks drainage.

If you installed a new disposal, check for a knock-out plug. This plug must be removed for dishwasher drainage. Use a hammer and screwdriver to remove it.

## Troubleshooting the LG Dishwasher Drain Pump and Motor

If you have checked everything else and your LG dishwasher still won't drain, the issue might be with the drain pump or motor. The drain pump is a vital component. It creates the pressure needed to expel water from the dishwasher tub. When it fails, water remains stagnant. This is a more involved repair, but understanding the signs can help you decide your next steps.

Listen for unusual noises during the drain cycle. A humming sound without water movement suggests the pump motor is running but the impeller is jammed. Grinding noises or silence when it should be draining indicate a faulty motor or pump. First, make sure the power is off. Then, access the drain pump, usually located beneath the dishwasher or behind the lower access panel. You might need to tilt the dishwasher to reach it. Visually inspect the pump for any foreign objects. Small pieces of glass, plastic, or food can jam the impeller. Carefully remove any obstructions. If the impeller spins freely and there are no visible blockages, the pump motor might be failing. Testing the pump's electrical resistance with a multimeter can confirm this. A reading outside the manufacturer's specified range indicates a bad pump. While some experienced DIYers might attempt to replace a drain pump, it is a complex task. It often requires specific tools and knowledge. If you are unsure, calling a qualified appliance technician is the safest and most efficient option. For those curious about electrical checks, understanding [how many ohms should a dishwasher drain pump have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-many-ohms-should-a-dishwasher-drain-pump-have) can be helpful.

### Signs of a Failing Drain Pump

A failing drain pump shows specific symptoms. You might hear a humming noise but no water draining. This means the motor runs, but something blocks the impeller. Silence during the drain cycle is another sign. The pump might not be getting power, or the motor is dead.

Look for water standing in the tub after every cycle. These signs point to a problem with the pump. It needs your attention.

### When to Call a Professional

Sometimes, the repair is beyond DIY skills. If you suspect a faulty drain pump or motor, professional help is wise. These parts are often hard to access. They require specific tools.

A professional technician has the expertise. They can diagnose complex electrical or mechanical issues. They can safely replace the faulty pump. This saves you time and prevents further damage.

## Preventing Future LG Dishwasher Drainage Problems

Preventing drainage problems is always better than fixing them. Regular maintenance keeps your LG dishwasher running smoothly. Simple habits can extend its lifespan. I follow a few key practices to avoid issues.

First, scrape plates before loading them. Large food scraps, bones, and paper labels are the primary culprits for clogs. While pre-rinsing is not always necessary with modern dishwashers, removing large debris is crucial. Second, clean your dishwasher filter regularly. Make it a monthly habit. This prevents the buildup of grease and small food particles. A clean filter ensures proper water flow. Third, occasionally run a cleaning cycle. Use a dishwasher cleaner or a cup of white vinegar. Place the vinegar in a dishwasher-safe cup on the top rack. Run a hot water cycle. This helps dissolve grease and mineral deposits in the pipes and pump. Fourth, ensure your drain hose remains free of kinks. Check it periodically, especially if you move the dishwasher. Lastly, always run your garbage disposal before starting a dishwasher cycle if it drains into it. This clears any food waste that could otherwise cause a backup. Adopting these habits minimizes the chances of your LG dishwasher not draining again. Consistent cleaning is key, and understanding [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain) thoroughly is a great start.

### Maintenance Tips

*   **Pre-scrape dishes:** Remove large food particles before loading. This prevents them from clogging the filter.
*   **Clean the filter monthly:** Regularly remove and rinse the filter assembly. This removes trapped food and grease.
*   **Run a cleaning cycle:** Use a dishwasher cleaner or white vinegar monthly. This cleans internal components and hoses.
*   **Check drain hose:** Ensure the drain hose is not kinked or bent. This allows free water flow.
*   **Clear garbage disposal:** Always run your garbage disposal before the dishwasher cycle. This prevents backups.
