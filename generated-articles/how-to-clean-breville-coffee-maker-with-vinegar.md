## Step-by-Step Guide to Descaling Your Breville with Vinegar

Descaling your Breville coffee maker with vinegar is a straightforward process. It involves running a diluted vinegar solution through the machine. This helps dissolve mineral buildup. Follow these steps carefully for the best results.

First, empty the water reservoir completely. Remove any water filter currently in place. If your Breville has a water filter, ensure you remove it before descaling. We have a detailed guide on [how to clean Breville coffee machine water filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-breville-coffee-machine-water-filter) for when you reinstall it. This prevents the filter from absorbing the vinegar. It also ensures the cleaning solution directly treats the internal components.

Next, prepare your cleaning solution. Mix equal parts white distilled vinegar and water. For example, if your reservoir holds 60 ounces, use 30 ounces of vinegar and 30 ounces of water. Pour this mixture into the machine's water tank. Do not overfill the tank.

Place a large, empty container under the brew group and steam wand. This container will catch the expelled cleaning solution. It prevents spills on your countertop. Make sure the container is large enough to hold the entire tank's contents.

Now, start the descaling process. Turn on your Breville coffee maker. If your machine has a dedicated descaling cycle, activate it. Follow your Breville model's specific instructions for this mode. If it does not have a descaling cycle, run several brew cycles manually. You want the entire vinegar solution to pass through the machine.

Run half of the vinegar solution through the brew head. Then, run the other half through the steam wand or hot water dispenser. This ensures all parts that handle water get cleaned. The solution needs time to work. After running the first half, let the machine sit for 15-30 minutes. This allows the vinegar to dissolve stubborn scale. Then, run the remaining solution.

### Detailed Descaling Procedure

*   **Empty and Remove Filter:** Clear the water reservoir. Take out the water filter.
*   **Mix Solution:** Combine equal parts white vinegar and water.
*   **Fill Reservoir:** Pour the vinegar-water mixture into the tank.
*   **Position Container:** Place a large container under the brew spout and steam wand.
*   **Initiate Cycle:**
    *   If your Breville has a 'descale' function, activate it.
    *   Otherwise, run half the solution through a normal brew cycle.
    *   Pause for 15-30 minutes.
    *   Run the remaining half through the steam wand or hot water dispenser.
*   **Repeat (if necessary):** For very heavy scale buildup, you might need to repeat the vinegar solution steps. Ensure to use fresh solution if you repeat.

This thorough process ensures that the vinegar reaches and cleans all essential internal components. It removes mineral deposits effectively. This prepares your machine for the next steps in cleaning.

## Cleaning Removable Parts of Your Breville Coffee Maker

After descaling the internal system, focus on the removable parts. These components accumulate coffee grounds, oils, and general grime. Cleaning them separately ensures a complete and hygienic result. This step greatly impacts your coffee's flavor and machine's cleanliness.

Start with the portafilter and filter baskets. Knock out any spent coffee grounds. Rinse them under hot water. For a deeper clean, mix a small amount of white vinegar with warm water in a bowl. Submerge the portafilter and baskets in this solution. Let them soak for about 15-20 minutes. The vinegar helps break down stubborn coffee oils and residue. After soaking, scrub them with a small brush or sponge. Pay attention to the filter screen holes. Ensure they are clear of any blockages.

Next, clean the drip tray and its grid. The drip tray collects excess water and coffee drips. It can become a breeding ground for bacteria if not cleaned regularly. Empty the tray. Wash it with warm soapy water. You can also use a vinegar-water solution for a more thorough clean. Wipe down the grid to remove any stains.

Consider the steam wand. If your Breville has one, milk residue can dry inside and block it. Immediately after each use, purge the steam wand and wipe it clean. For a deeper clean during maintenance, soak the tip of the steam wand in a small cup of hot water with a few drops of vinegar. This helps dissolve any hardened milk. Then, purge the steam wand again to clear its internal path.

Do not forget the water reservoir lid and the water filter housing. These also benefit from a quick wipe down. Use a damp cloth with a little vinegar solution. This removes any film or dust. Ensure all parts are thoroughly rinsed with clean water before reassembly. This prevents any lingering vinegar taste.
