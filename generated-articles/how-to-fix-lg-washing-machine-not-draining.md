An LG washing machine that will not drain usually has a blocked drain hose, a clogged pump filter, or a malfunctioning drain pump. You can fix these issues by clearing obstructions from the hose or filter, or by replacing a faulty pump. Always disconnect power before starting repairs.

## Safety First: Preparing for Washing Machine Repair

Before you start any work on your LG washing machine, safety is paramount. Water and electricity are a dangerous combination. Taking proper precautions protects you from injury and prevents further damage to your appliance. You must ensure the washing machine is completely disconnected from power.

The first step is to unplug the washing machine from the electrical outlet. This removes all power from the unit. Do not just turn it off; physically remove the plug. Next, turn off the water supply to the washer. Close both the hot and cold water valves. This prevents water from flooding your laundry room. You can also place towels around the base of the machine to catch any spilled water.

Prepare your workspace by gathering the necessary tools. You might need a bucket, towels, pliers, screwdrivers (Phillips and flathead), and a flashlight. Having these items ready saves time during the repair process. Always wear gloves to protect your hands from grime or sharp edges. By following these safety steps, you create a secure environment to troubleshoot your LG washing machine not draining problem.

## Checking the Drain Hose: A Common Culprit

One of the simplest reasons your LG washing machine is not draining involves the drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the washer to your standpipe or utility sink. If this hose becomes obstructed or kinked, water cannot flow out properly. This causes water to back up in the drum. It is a very common issue many homeowners overlook.

First, pull your LG washing machine away from the wall slightly. You need enough space to inspect the entire length of the drain hose. Look for any visible kinks or bends in the hose. Sometimes, the washer gets pushed too close to the wall, crushing the hose. Straighten out any kinks you find. This simple action can often resolve the draining problem immediately.

Next, check for clogs within the hose itself. Disconnect the hose from the standpipe or utility sink. Be ready with a bucket and towels, as some water will likely come out. Look inside the end of the hose for any foreign objects. Small items like socks, lint, or pet hair can get stuck inside. You can use a flashlight to see further into the hose. If you suspect a deeper clog, you might need to detach the hose from the back of the washer. A plumber's snake or a long brush can help clear persistent blockages. Remember, a clear path is essential for your LG washer to drain effectively. Many people find answers by focusing on how to get an LG washing machine to drain properly.

## Inspecting the Drain Pump Filter/Coin Trap

A frequently neglected part of your LG washing machine is the drain pump filter, also known as the coin trap. This filter catches lint, coins, buttons, and other small items before they reach the drain pump. Over time, these items accumulate, forming a blockage. This blockage then prevents water from draining out of your machine. Regular cleaning of this filter is essential for proper drainage.

The location of the drain pump filter varies by LG model. For most front-load LG washers, you will find it behind a small access panel at the bottom front of the machine. For some top-load models, the filter might be located under the agitator or in a different access area. Refer to your LG washing machine's user manual if you cannot find it. Before opening the filter, prepare for water spillage. Place a shallow pan or tray under the filter cap. You will also need towels to absorb any excess water.

To clean the filter, slowly unscrew the cap or turn the knob counter-clockwise. Water will drain out, so let it empty completely into your pan. Once the water stops, remove the filter completely. Inspect it for any lint, debris, coins, or other foreign objects. Clean the filter under running water, removing all trapped material. Also, check the housing where the filter sits for any remaining debris. Carefully replace the filter and tighten the cap securely. Make sure it is hand-tight to prevent leaks. Regularly cleaning this filter can prevent your LG washing machine not draining issue from recurring. Cleaning other parts of your LG washer, such as the HE dispenser, also contributes to its efficiency. You can learn more about general cleaning practices for your appliance at [how to clean LG HE washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-he-washing-machine). If you have a top-load LG washer, specifically check out resources on [how to clean top load LG washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-top-load-lg-washing-machine-filter).

## Troubleshooting the Drain Pump

If the drain hose is clear and the filter is clean, the problem might be with the drain pump itself. The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the washing machine. A faulty or obstructed pump will prevent your LG washing machine from draining. There are a few ways a drain pump can fail.

First, the pump could be clogged internally. Even if the filter is clean, smaller debris can bypass it and get stuck in the pump's impeller. To check this, you typically need to access the pump. This often means removing the front or back panel of your washer, depending on the model. Once you locate the pump, disconnect its hoses and electrical connectors. Carefully inspect the impeller, which is a small fan-like component inside the pump. Remove any debris you find. This step requires careful handling to avoid damaging the pump.

Second, the drain pump motor might have failed. You can often test this by listening for a humming sound when the washer should be draining. If you hear nothing, or only a faint hum without water movement, the motor might be faulty. A multimeter can test the electrical continuity of the motor. If it does not show continuity, the pump needs replacement. Replacing a drain pump involves disconnecting power, water, and hoses, then unmounting the old pump and installing a new one. This task can be challenging for beginners. If your LG washing machine is not draining due to a failed pump, replacement is typically the only fix.

## Examining the Lid Switch/Door Latch (Front-Loaders)

Many LG washing machines, especially front-load models, have a safety mechanism called a lid switch or door latch. This component ensures the washer cannot spin or drain unless the door is securely closed. If this switch or latch malfunctions, the machine might incorrectly think the door is open. This prevents the drain cycle from activating. This is a common cause for your LG washing machine not draining.

For front-load washers, the door latch assembly usually contains a switch. This switch signals to the control board that the door is shut. Check the door for any visible damage. Ensure it closes firmly and latches securely. Sometimes, a worn latch mechanism prevents full engagement. If the latch does not engage properly, the washer will not proceed with draining or spinning.

You can often test the lid switch or door latch using a multimeter. First, locate the switch. For a front-loader, it's typically integrated into the door lock assembly. For a top-loader, it's usually under the top panel near the lid hinge. With the power disconnected, remove the electrical connectors from the switch. Set your multimeter to the continuity setting. Place the probes on the switch terminals. Close the door or lid. If the switch is working, the multimeter should show continuity (or a change in resistance). If it shows no continuity when the door is closed, the switch is faulty. A broken lid switch or door latch requires replacement. This ensures your LG washing machine drains and spins properly.

## Investigating Clogs in the Drain System

Beyond the drain hose and pump filter, clogs can occur in other parts of your LG washing machine's drain system. These blockages can happen anywhere along the path water takes to exit the machine. They can be tricky to find but are crucial to clear. A persistent clog will always prevent your LG washing machine from draining.

One common area for clogs is the standpipe or wall drain itself. This is the vertical pipe where your washer's drain hose empties. Over time, lint, soap scum, and other debris can build up inside this pipe. This creates a partial or complete blockage. To check this, remove the washer's drain hose from the standpipe. Pour a bucket of water down the standpipe. If the water drains slowly or backs up, the clog is in your household plumbing, not the washer. You might need a plumber or a powerful drain snake to clear this type of clog.

Another potential area is the internal drain hose that connects the tub to the pump. This hose can accumulate debris or even get a foreign object stuck inside. Accessing this hose usually involves tilting the machine back or laying it on its side, after fully draining any water. Disconnect the hose at both ends and inspect it. You can flush it with water or use a flexible brush to clear any blockages. Always ensure all connections are tight and secure when reassembling. Addressing these deeper clogs is vital for completely resolving your LG washing machine not draining issue. Sometimes, other issues like an "IE" error code can also relate to water intake or draining problems. You can find more information on specific error codes, such as the LG IE error, at [how to fix LG washing machine IE error](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-washing-machine-ie-error).

## Dealing with Drive Belt Issues (Top-Loaders)

For some LG top-load washing machine models, especially older ones, a drive belt is part of the mechanism that powers the drain pump. While direct drive models are more common now, a loose or broken drive belt can cause the pump not to engage. If your LG washing machine is not draining and it's a top-load model with a belt, this is worth checking. The belt typically connects the motor to the transmission and pump.

First, you need to access the internal components of your top-load washer. This usually involves removing the outer cabinet. Refer to your user manual for specific instructions on how to safely do this. Once the cabinet is off, locate the drive belt. It will be a thick, rubber belt wrapped around pulleys. Visually inspect the belt. Look for signs of wear, fraying, cracks, or if it has completely broken. A worn belt might slip, preventing the pump from getting enough power to drain water.

If the belt is loose, you might be able to tighten it if there's an adjustment mechanism. However, if the belt is broken or severely worn, it needs replacement. Replacement involves carefully removing the old belt and fitting a new one around the pulleys. This can be tricky and might require some force. Ensure the new belt is properly seated. A correctly tensioned drive belt ensures the drain pump receives power. This helps resolve the LG washing machine not draining problem in belt-driven models.

## Advanced Diagnostics: Pressure Sensor & Main Control Board

After checking all the common culprits, if your LG washing machine is still not draining, the problem might lie with more advanced components. The pressure sensor and the main control board are crucial parts of the washer's drainage system. They communicate to manage water levels and cycles. These components rarely fail, but their malfunction can cause complex issues.

The pressure sensor, also called a pressure switch or water level sensor, detects the water level inside the tub. It tells the main control board when the tub is full and when it's empty. If this sensor is faulty, it might incorrectly signal that the tub is still full, even after the pump has operated. This prevents the next cycle (like spinning) from starting, or it might prevent the drain cycle from completing fully. You can sometimes test a pressure sensor with a multimeter for continuity as it changes state, but true diagnostic often requires specialized knowledge or replacement. A clogged or kinked air trap hose connected to the pressure sensor can also cause similar symptoms. This hose sends air pressure signals from the tub to the sensor.

The main control board acts as the "brain" of your LG washing machine. It receives signals from all sensors and sends commands to all components, including the drain pump. If the control board is faulty, it might not send the correct signal to the drain pump to activate. This would cause your LG washing machine not draining issue. Diagnosing a faulty control board is difficult without specialized tools or knowledge. It usually involves ruling out all other possible issues first. Replacement of a control board is often expensive and should only be done if you are certain it's the problem. It is usually a last resort solution. If your LG washer is filling but not draining, it could be a sensor or control board issue.

## Preventing Future Draining Problems with Maintenance

Preventative maintenance is the best way to avoid your LG washing machine not draining again. Regular care keeps your appliance running smoothly and extends its lifespan. Taking a few simple steps consistently can save you from future headaches and repair costs. I always recommend proactive care for major appliances.

Firstly, make it a habit to clean the drain pump filter regularly. For most households, doing this once every one to three months is sufficient. This prevents lint, coins, and other small items from building up. A clear filter ensures unrestricted water flow during the drain cycle. Mark it on your calendar or set a reminder to ensure you do not forget.

Secondly, ensure clothes are free of small objects before washing. Check pockets for coins, keys, hairpins, and tissues. These items are common culprits for clogging the drain pump and hoses. Zipping up zippers and fastening hooks can also prevent them from snagging or scratching the drum. Using laundry bags for delicate items can also help contain small parts.

Finally, use the correct amount and type of detergent. High-efficiency (HE) washers require HE detergent, which produces less suds. Too much detergent or using non-HE detergent can create excessive suds. These suds can clog the drain system or interfere with the pressure sensor. Running a monthly "Tub Clean" cycle with a washer cleaner or white vinegar also helps. This washes away detergent residue and mold. You can learn more about general cleaning of your LG washer, including using vinegar, at [how to clean LG washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washing-machine-with-vinegar). Consistent maintenance keeps your LG washing machine draining reliably.
