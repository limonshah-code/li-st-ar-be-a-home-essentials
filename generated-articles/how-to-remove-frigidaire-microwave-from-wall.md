### Essential Preparations for Frigidaire Microwave Removal

Before you begin to remove your Frigidaire microwave from the wall, proper preparation is key. This step protects you and your kitchen. It also makes the removal process easier. Gather all needed tools and understand the basic steps.

#### Gathering Your Tools

Having the right tools ready saves time and effort. Most of these items are common household tools. Ensure they are in good condition.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Phillips Head Screwdriver:** This tool removes various screws.
*   **Flathead Screwdriver:** Use this for prying or specific screws.
*   **Power Drill with Screw Bits:** A drill speeds up the process for many screws.
*   **Gloves:** Protect your hands from sharp edges or dirt.
*   **Safety Glasses:** Protect your eyes from falling debris.
*   **Step Ladder or Sturdy Stool:** You need to reach the top of the microwave.
*   **Duct Tape or Painter's Tape:** Use this to secure the microwave door.
*   **Heavy-Duty Work Gloves (optional but recommended):** These offer better grip on the microwave.
*   **Support for the Microwave:** A stack of books, a sturdy box, or a second person.
*   **A Second Person:** This is critical. Microwaves are heavy and awkward to handle alone.

#### Prioritizing Safety Measures

Safety is the most important part of any appliance removal. Microwaves are heavy and involve electrical connections. Ignoring safety can lead to injury or damage.

Always follow these safety guidelines:

*   **Disconnect Power:** This is the first and most vital step. Locate your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker for the kitchen or the specific microwave circuit. Flip it to the "off" position. Double-check that the microwave is off by trying to turn it on. This prevents electric shock.
*   **Secure the Door:** Use duct tape or painter's tape to secure the microwave door shut. This stops it from swinging open during removal. An open door can cause the microwave to become unbalanced.
*   **Protect Your Work Area:** Lay down towels or cardboard on your countertop and floor. This prevents scratches or damage to surfaces. It also helps catch any debris during removal.
*   **Work with a Partner:** Over-the-range microwaves weigh 60-100 pounds. Lifting one alone is unsafe and difficult. A second person helps hold the weight. They can also guide the microwave off the mounting plate.
*   **Wear Protective Gear:** Safety glasses protect your eyes from dust or falling screws. Gloves protect your hands from sharp metal edges.

Taking these preparatory steps ensures a safer and more efficient removal process. You are now ready to start disconnecting your Frigidaire microwave. Different microwave brands may have similar removal methods. For example, learning [how to remove an LG microwave from the wall](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-lg-microwave-from-wall) or [how to remove a GE microwave from the wall](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-ge-microwave-from-wall) can provide helpful context. Even [how to remove a Whirlpool microwave from the wall](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-whirlpool-microwave-from-wall) often follows a similar basic sequence.

### Disconnecting Power and Preparing the Area

Once you have gathered your tools and understand the safety measures, the next step is to ensure all power is off and your workspace is ready. This stage prevents accidents and prepares the appliance for removal.

#### Turning Off the Circuit Breaker

You must cut power to the microwave before touching any wires. This prevents electric shock. Do not just unplug the microwave from the wall outlet, as some microwaves are hardwired.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Locate Your Circuit Breaker Box:** This box is usually in your basement, garage, or a utility closet.
2.  **Identify the Microwave Breaker:** Look for labels on the breaker panel. It might say "Kitchen," "Microwave," or an appliance name. If labels are unclear, turn off the main breaker for a moment. This will cut power to your entire house.
3.  **Flip the Switch:** Move the correct breaker switch to the "off" position. It usually clicks into place.
4.  **Verify Power is Off:** Go back to the microwave. Try to turn it on or press some buttons. The display should be dark and unresponsive. If it still works, return to the breaker box and try another switch.

#### Unplugging the Microwave Cord (If Applicable)

Some Frigidaire microwaves plug into an outlet in the cabinet above them. Others are hardwired. Check your specific model.

Here's what to do:

*   **Open the Cabinet:** Open the cabinet doors directly above your microwave.
*   **Locate the Outlet:** Look inside for a power cord plugged into an outlet.
*   **Unplug the Cord:** Firmly pull the cord from the outlet.
*   **No Outlet? Hardwired:** If you do not see a cord or outlet, your microwave is hardwired. This means wires connect directly to your home's electrical system. Only an electrician should handle hardwired disconnections if you are unsure. For typical home removal, the wires usually feed into the cabinet above, where they connect with wire nuts. You will disconnect these after the unit is down.

#### Clearing the Countertop and Securing the Door

A clear workspace is safer and more efficient. Protecting your surfaces is also important.

Steps to prepare the area:

1.  **Remove All Items:** Clear everything from the countertop directly under the microwave. This includes small appliances, decor, and anything else. You need a completely open space to lower the heavy appliance.
2.  **Protect the Counter and Floor:** Lay down thick blankets, old towels, or cardboard. Place them over your countertop. This prevents scratches or dents if the microwave shifts or drops slightly. Extend the protection to the floor if possible.
3.  **Secure the Microwave Door:** Use strong tape, like painter's tape or duct tape, to tape the microwave door shut. Place strips across the door and onto the microwave body. This stops the door from swinging open. An open door can throw off the microwave's balance when you lift it. This can make the unit harder to control.

With power disconnected and the area prepped, you are ready for the physical removal steps.

### Locating and Removing Top Cabinet Bolts

Most Frigidaire over-the-range microwaves use a similar mounting system. This system involves a metal mounting plate on the wall and bolts that secure the top of the microwave to the cabinet above. Identifying and removing these top bolts is a crucial step for wall microwave removal.

#### Accessing the Upper Cabinet

The first step is to get inside the cabinet directly above the microwave. This is where the top mounting bolts are located.

1.  **Open Cabinet Doors:** Fully open the cabinet doors above your Frigidaire microwave.
2.  **Look for Access Holes:** You will see the bottom of the cabinet. Look for a few drilled holes. These holes align with the top of your microwave. The mounting bolts pass through these holes.
3.  **Locate the Bolts:** You should see the heads of large bolts. There are usually two or three. They hold the top of the microwave unit in place. These bolts typically have a large head for a Phillips screwdriver or a hex head.

#### Unscrewing the Top Mounting Bolts

These bolts carry much of the microwave's weight at the top. You need to unscrew them completely.

1.  **Use the Correct Tool:** Choose the right screwdriver or drill bit for the bolt heads. A Phillips head is common. Sometimes, a socket wrench is needed for hex bolts.
2.  **Support the Microwave:** This is a vital moment. As you loosen these bolts, the top of the microwave will become free. The entire weight of the microwave will then rest on the wall mounting plate and the person holding it. Have your helper ready to support the microwave from underneath. You can also place a sturdy support, like a stack of books or a sturdy box, under the front edge of the microwave. This offers temporary support.
3.  **Unscrew Bolts Slowly:** Carefully unscrew each bolt. Turn them counter-clockwise until they are completely loose. Do not let the microwave drop forward once they are loose.
4.  **Keep the Bolts:** Save these bolts. You might need them for installing a new microwave. They are often specific to microwave mounting.

Some Frigidaire microwave models may have slight variations in bolt placement or type. Refer to your owner's manual if you have it. If you need to troubleshoot *why* you are removing the microwave, perhaps it is [not working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-frigidaire-microwave-not-working) or [not heating up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-frigidaire-microwave-not-heating-up). Understanding the cause might help with future repairs or replacement choices.

### Carefully Lowering the Frigidaire Microwave

With the top bolts removed, the microwave is now only resting on its wall mounting plate. This part of the removal process requires careful coordination, especially because of the microwave's weight.

#### Lifting and Tilting the Microwave

The microwave usually hangs on small tabs or hooks on the wall mounting plate. To free it, you need to lift the unit up and tilt it forward.

1.  **Position Your Helper:** Have your helper stand in front of the microwave. They should position themselves to support the entire weight of the microwave. Their hands should be under the bottom of the microwave.
2.  **Lift Up and Away:** As a team, slowly lift the front of the microwave up and slightly away from the wall. You need to lift it enough for the tabs on the back of the microwave to clear the mounting plate. Most microwaves require an upward lift of about half an inch to an inch.
3.  **Tilt Forward:** Once the top tabs clear, tilt the entire microwave forward. Do this slowly and with control. This action disengages the microwave from the mounting plate's lower lip.
4.  **Watch for Wires:** As you tilt, be mindful of any remaining electrical wires or vent ducts. If your microwave was hardwired, the wires might still be connected in the cabinet. If there's a vent, it might still be attached to the back of the microwave leading to the outside or recirculating inside.

#### Disconnecting Remaining Connections

Before fully moving the microwave, ensure all connections are loose.

1.  **Exhaust Duct (If Applicable):** Many over-the-range microwaves connect to a house ventilation system. This is usually a metal duct or flexible tube.
    *   If present, disconnect this duct from the back of the microwave. Some have small screws; others just pull off.
    *   Cover the open duct in the wall with tape or a rag to prevent debris from falling in.
2.  **Power Cord/Wiring:**
    *   **Plugged-in Models:** If your microwave has a power cord, ensure it is completely unplugged from the outlet in the cabinet above.
    *   **Hardwired Models:** If the microwave is hardwired, the electrical connection box is usually in the cabinet above. Once the microwave is tilted, you may have more room to access these wires. Carefully disconnect the wire nuts connecting the microwave's wiring to your home's electrical wires. Remember black to black, white to white, and green to green (ground). Always ensure the circuit breaker is off.

#### Safely Lowering the Unit

Now the microwave is free from all attachments. It is time to bring it down.

1.  **Maintain Control:** Both you and your helper must maintain a firm grip on the microwave. The unit is heavy and can cause injury if dropped.
2.  **Lower to Countertop:** Slowly lower the microwave onto the protected countertop surface directly below it. Take small steps if you need to reposition your grip.
3.  **Move to a Safe Spot:** Once on the counter, slide the microwave carefully to a clear area. You can put it on the floor or a cart. Ensure it is out of the way of further work.

This step completes the removal of the Frigidaire microwave from the wall. You have successfully disengaged it from its mounting points and connections. The next step involves removing the mounting plate itself.

### Detaching the Wall Mounting Plate

After removing your Frigidaire microwave, a metal mounting plate remains on the wall. This plate is usually screwed directly into wall studs. Removing it prepares your wall for repair or a new appliance installation.

#### Understanding the Mounting Plate

The mounting plate is a strong, flat metal bracket. It is designed to support the microwave's weight. It typically attaches to at least two wall studs for stability. Identifying the screws that hold it is straightforward.

#### Steps to Remove the Mounting Plate

Removing the plate is less complex than removing the microwave itself. It generally involves unscrewing several screws.

1.  **Locate All Screws:** Look closely at the mounting plate. You will see several screws holding it to the wall. These screws are usually large and heavy-duty. They may be Phillips head, hex head, or Torx screws.
2.  **Use the Correct Tool:** Select the right screwdriver or drill bit that fits the screws snugly. A power drill can speed up this process.
3.  **Unscrew Each Fastener:** Begin unscrewing each fastener. Turn counter-clockwise until the screw comes out. Place the screws in a bag or container. This keeps them together for later use or disposal.
4.  **Pull the Plate Away:** Once all screws are removed, the mounting plate should come freely away from the wall. If it sticks, gently pry it using a flathead screwdriver or putty knife. Be careful not to damage the wall more than necessary.

#### What to Do After Plate Removal

After the plate is off, you will see holes in your wall. You might also see damage to the drywall.

*   **Assess Wall Damage:** Inspect the wall surface. There will be screw holes. There might be areas where the drywall paper peeled.
*   **Prepare for Patching:** If you are not immediately installing a new microwave, you will need to patch these holes. This might involve applying spackle or drywall compound. You might also need to sand and paint the area.
*   **Store or Dispose:** Decide if you want to keep the old mounting plate. If you are installing a new microwave, it will likely come with its own mounting hardware. Old plates are generally not reusable for new appliances unless specified. You can recycle the metal plate if your local facilities accept it.

Removing the mounting plate is the final step in physically detaching the microwave system. Now, your wall is clear for any necessary repairs or future installations.

### Post-Removal Steps and Wall Cleanup

After successfully removing your Frigidaire microwave and its mounting plate, the area will likely need some attention. This final stage involves cleaning up and preparing the space for its next purpose, whether that is installing a new appliance or repairing the wall.

#### Cleaning the Area

The area behind and around the microwave often collects grease, dust, and food splatter. This is a good time for a deep clean.

1.  **Wipe Down Surfaces:** Use a degreaser or all-purpose cleaner to wipe down the wall, countertop, and surrounding cabinets. Pay attention to any vent openings.
2.  **Vacuum Debris:** Use a vacuum cleaner to remove any dust, drywall bits, or old food particles that fell during the removal process.
3.  **Check for Mold/Mildew:** Sometimes, moisture can build up behind appliances. Look for any signs of mold or mildew. If found, clean the area thoroughly with a bleach solution or mold remover. Ensure the area is completely dry.

#### Patching Wall Holes and Damages

The removal process leaves holes and possibly damaged drywall. Repairing these prepares the wall for painting or a new installation.

1.  **Gather Materials:** You will need drywall spackle or compound, a putty knife, fine-grit sandpaper, and a damp cloth.
2.  **Fill Holes:** Use the putty knife to apply spackle to all screw holes and small indentations. Press the spackle firmly into the holes.
3.  **Smooth Surface:** Scrape off any excess spackle, leaving a smooth surface flush with the wall.
4.  **Allow to Dry:** Let the spackle dry completely. Drying time varies based on thickness and humidity. Follow product instructions.
5.  **Sand Smooth:** Once dry, gently sand the patched areas until they are smooth and blend with the wall. Wipe away dust with a damp cloth.
6.  **Prime and Paint:** If you are not installing a new microwave immediately, prime the patched areas. Then, paint the wall to match the surrounding area.

#### Considering a New Installation

If you plan to install a new over-the-range microwave, here are some points to consider. This new unit will likely come with its own mounting plate. You will not reuse the old Frigidaire plate.

*   **New Mounting Plate:** New microwaves almost always come with a brand-specific mounting plate and template. You will need to install this new plate.
*   **Measure First:** Measure the space carefully before buying a new microwave. Ensure the new unit fits the dimensions.
*   **Ventilation:** Check the ventilation requirements of your new microwave. Ensure it matches your current ducting setup (recirculating, top-vented, or rear-vented).
