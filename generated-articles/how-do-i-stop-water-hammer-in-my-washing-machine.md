## Silence the Bang: Stop Washing Machine Water Hammer

Do you ever hear a sudden, loud bang from your pipes when your washing machine fills or drains? This startling noise is a common household problem called water hammer. It is not just an annoyance; it can cause real damage to your plumbing system over time. Hearing this sound means your pipes are under stress.

Nobody wants their home to sound like a construction site every laundry day. This guide shows you exactly how to stop water hammer in your washing machine. We will explain why it happens and provide practical steps you can take. You will learn about simple fixes, essential repairs, and long-term solutions. Get ready to enjoy quieter laundry cycles and protect your home's plumbing.

### Takeaway

*   Water hammer comes from sudden water flow changes in pipes.
*   Check and secure loose pipes behind your washing machine.
*   Install water hammer arrestors directly onto your washing machine's water supply lines.
*   Reduce high water pressure in your home with a pressure reducing valve.
*   Bleed air from your plumbing system regularly to prevent air pockets.

To stop water hammer in your washing machine, first check for loose pipes and secure them. If the noise continues, install water hammer arrestors on the hot and cold water supply lines. You may also need to check and adjust your home's water pressure. These steps help absorb the pressure shock and quiet your plumbing system.

### Understanding Water Hammer: The Causes of Noisy Pipes

Water hammer is a common plumbing issue that creates a loud banging sound. This noise happens when water flowing through pipes suddenly stops or changes direction. Your washing machine's quick-closing valves are often the main culprit. When these valves shut off rapidly, the moving water has nowhere to go.

The water's momentum then creates a shock wave that travels through your pipes. This shock wave causes the pipes to vibrate and hit against walls or framing. High water pressure in your home makes this problem worse. Air trapped inside the pipes can also contribute to the loud banging. This issue is not just about noise; it stresses your entire plumbing system.

Older homes with rigid copper pipes are especially prone to water hammer. Modern homes can also experience it, especially with high-efficiency appliances. Sometimes, a lack of air chambers or a faulty pressure reducing valve is the reason. Understanding these causes helps you choose the right fix. Fixing water hammer protects your pipes from leaks and early failure. It also ensures a peaceful home environment.

### How to Identify Water Hammer in Your Washing Machine System

Identifying water hammer is usually straightforward because of its distinct sound. You will hear a loud banging, clanking, or thumping noise. This noise typically occurs when your washing machine fills with water. It also happens when the machine finishes a cycle and closes its water inlet valves. The sound can be very alarming and feels like something is hitting the pipes.

Other household appliances can cause water hammer, too. Dishwashers, ice makers, and even toilet flushes can create similar noises. However, if the sound consistently coincides with your washing machine's water cycles, the washer is the source. Listen closely during the fill phase and at the end of the rinse or wash cycles. You might hear the banging as the water rapidly cuts off.

Sometimes, the noise might be a loose pipe rattling against a wall stud. You can check this by gently pressing on pipes near the washing machine. If the rattling stops, securing the pipe might fix the issue. However, if the banging is sharp and sudden, it often indicates actual water hammer. Understanding the sound's timing helps confirm the problem's source. If your washing machine is not getting water, or if it stops after filling, these issues can sometimes be related to the water supply flow dynamics that contribute to water hammer. For specific issues like [why your Samsung washing machine has no water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-samsung-washing-machine-no-water) or [why your GE washing machine stops after filling](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-washing-machine-stop-after-filling), these problems might point to underlying water supply conditions that also aggravate water hammer effects.

### Simple DIY Solutions for Washing Machine Water Hammer

You can try several simple solutions to stop water hammer in your washing machine. These fixes do not require a plumber and often resolve the issue. Start by checking your water pressure. High water pressure can intensify water hammer, so reducing it can make a big difference. You can purchase a water pressure gauge at any hardware store to test your home's pressure.

If your pressure is above 80 PSI, you might need to adjust your pressure reducing valve (PRV). This valve is usually found where the main water line enters your house. You can also try securing loose pipes. Pipes that are not properly anchored can rattle and bang more loudly. Use pipe straps or clamps to firmly attach any loose pipes to wall studs or joists.

Another common trick is to purge air from your plumbing system. Air pockets in pipes can contribute to the banging noise. To do this, turn off your main water supply. Then, open all faucets in your house, starting from the highest point. Let them drain completely. After that, close all faucets and slowly turn your main water supply back on. This process pushes trapped air out of the system. Remember, before doing any work on your water lines, you should always [turn off the water to your washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-off-water-to-washing-machine) to prevent spills. Many minor plumbing issues can be resolved with a bit of effort if you have some [do-it-yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) repair skills.

### Installing Water Hammer Arrestors: A Proven Remedy

Water hammer arrestors offer a highly effective solution for stopping noisy pipes. These devices are small, cylinder-shaped gadgets that connect to your washing machine's water supply lines. They contain a piston and a compressed air chamber. When water pressure surges, the piston moves, compressing the air. This action absorbs the shock wave and prevents the banging sound. Arrestors essentially provide a cushion for the sudden water pressure changes.

Installation is usually straightforward and can be a DIY project. First, you must [turn off the water to your washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-off-water-to-washing-machine) completely. Then, disconnect the hot and cold water supply hoses from the back of the machine. Screw an arrestor onto each of the machine's water inlet valves. After that, reattach the supply hoses to the other end of the arrestors. Ensure all connections are hand-tight, then use a wrench for a quarter turn.

Water hammer arrestors are widely available at hardware stores. They are an affordable way to protect your plumbing and eliminate annoying noises. Make sure to buy arrestors designed for washing machines, as they are often rated for higher flow rates. This installation is a great example of a simple [do-it-yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) improvement. Once installed, slowly turn the water supply back on and check for any leaks before running a cycle.

### Optimizing Your Home's Plumbing to Prevent Water Hammer

Optimizing your home's entire plumbing system can provide long-term prevention of water hammer. One key area to consider is your home's main water pressure. If it is consistently too high, it puts extra strain on all your appliances and pipes. Installing or adjusting a pressure reducing valve (PRV) at your main water line can help. This valve lowers the incoming water pressure to a safe and stable level.

Proper pipe support is also vital throughout your home, not just near the washer. Pipes that are not firmly secured can move and vibrate excessively. Over time, this movement can worsen water hammer. Inspect visible pipes in your basement, crawl spaces, and utility areas. Use pipe clamps or hangers to secure any loose sections to stable structures. This simple step reduces the physical impact of water pressure changes.

Additionally, consider the layout and size of your pipes. If pipes are too small for the water demand, they can create turbulence and pressure fluctuations. While re-piping is a major project, understanding this aspect is important. Regular maintenance, like flushing your water heater, can also help. This removes sediment that might restrict flow and cause pressure issues. Always remember to [turn off the water to your washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-off-water-to-washing-machine) before making any significant plumbing adjustments.

### Washing Machine Maintenance and Best Practices

Regular maintenance of your washing machine and its connections helps prevent water hammer. Start by checking your water supply hoses. Old or stiff hoses can transfer vibrations more easily. Replace them if they show signs of wear, kinks, or stiffness. Ensure the hoses are not overtightened at the connections, which can also contribute to noise.

Make sure your washing machine is level and stable. An unbalanced machine can vibrate excessively, and these vibrations can transfer to your plumbing. Adjust the leveling feet on the bottom of the washer until it sits firmly on the floor. Use a spirit level to confirm it is perfectly even. A stable machine reduces stress on its internal components and connected pipes.

Periodically clean the inlet screens on your washing machine's water valves. Sediment and mineral buildup can restrict water flow, causing valves to close more abruptly. This restriction can increase the likelihood of water hammer. To clean them, [turn off the water to your washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-off-water-to-washing-machine), disconnect the hoses, and use pliers to pull out the screens. Rinse them under running water and reinstall them. If you ever need to [get water out of a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-you-get-water-out-of-a-washing-machine) for maintenance or repair, knowing the proper draining procedure is helpful. Understanding [how to stop a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-stop-washing-machine) mid-cycle safely can also be useful for quick checks during a wash.

### When to Seek Professional Help for Persistent Water Hammer

Sometimes, DIY solutions are not enough to stop water hammer in your washing machine. If you have tried basic fixes and installed arrestors without success, it might be time to call a professional plumber. Persistent water hammer can indicate a more serious underlying plumbing issue. A plumber has specialized tools to diagnose complex problems.

One common reason for needing professional help is extremely high or fluctuating water pressure. A plumber can accurately test your home's water pressure and recommend solutions like a new or adjusted pressure reducing valve. They can also inspect your main water supply lines. The issue might involve pipe routing or sizing that is beyond a simple fix.

A professional can identify issues like partially closed valves elsewhere in your home. They can also check for faulty air chambers or issues within the main plumbing structure. Ignoring severe water hammer can lead to burst pipes, leaks, and costly repairs down the road. If the banging is widespread across your house, not just at the washing machine, it points to a systemic problem. Do not hesitate to call an expert for peace of mind and long-term plumbing health.
