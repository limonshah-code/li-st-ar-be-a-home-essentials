Then, we provide clear, step-by-step instructions for a successful pump replacement. You can save money and gain valuable repair skills. Let us get your Maytag dishwasher running like new again.

### Takeaway:

To replace a Maytag dishwasher pump, first disconnect power and water. Then, access the sump area, remove the old pump by disconnecting hoses and wiring, and secure the new pump in place. Reconnect everything and test the appliance to ensure proper draining and washing.

### Understanding Your Maytag Dishwasher Pump

Your Maytag dishwasher pump is a core part of the appliance. It moves water through the dishwasher. There are typically two main types of pumps in a dishwasher. These are the circulation pump and the drain pump. Both pumps play vital roles in how your dishes get clean.

The circulation pump, also called the wash pump, moves water from the sump. It pushes water up to the spray arms. These spray arms then clean your dishes. If this pump fails, your dishes will not get clean. Water might sit at the bottom of the tub. The dishwasher might make strange noises during the wash cycle.

The drain pump removes dirty water from the dishwasher. After a wash cycle, this pump activates. It sends the water out through the drain hose. If your dishwasher has standing water, the drain pump is likely faulty. A clogged drain pump can also cause this problem. [Learning how to clean your dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-pump) helps prevent some issues. Knowing which pump is failing helps you fix the problem faster.

Both pumps are critical for dishwasher function. Sometimes, they come as one assembly. Other times, they are separate units. Understanding their roles helps in diagnosing issues. It also helps you get the right replacement part. Maytag models might have slightly different designs. Always check your specific model's diagram. This ensures you find the correct pump type for your repair.

### Diagnosing a Faulty Maytag Dishwasher Pump

Identifying a bad Maytag dishwasher pump is important before replacement. Several signs can tell you a pump is failing. Knowing these helps confirm the problem. This saves you time and effort. It also prevents buying the wrong parts.

One major sign is water not draining from the dishwasher. If you open the door after a cycle, and standing water sits at the bottom, your drain pump likely has an issue. The dishwasher might also stop mid-cycle. It waits for the water to drain. Sometimes, you might hear a humming sound, but no water movement. This points to a seized pump motor or a blockage inside the pump.

Another common symptom relates to cleaning performance. If your dishes come out dirty, especially with food particles still on them, the circulation pump might be failing. The spray arms need strong water pressure to clean effectively. A weak or broken circulation pump cannot provide this. You might also notice a burning smell. This indicates the motor is overheating from trying to run a seized pump. Listen for unusual noises like grinding or loud humming. These sounds often mean the pump bearings are worn out. They also indicate impeller damage. Checking the filter and ensuring it is clean is always a good first step.

### Tools and Parts Needed for Pump Replacement

Gathering the right tools and parts makes your Maytag dishwasher pump replacement smooth. Do this before you start any work. A well-prepared workspace prevents delays. It also ensures you have everything you need. This helps you complete the job safely and efficiently.

First, you need the correct replacement pump. Maytag dishwashers use specific pump models. Find your dishwasher's model number. It is usually on a sticker inside the door frame. Use this number to order the exact pump. You can check the manufacturer's website or an appliance parts store. Confirm if you need a drain pump, a circulation pump, or a combined assembly. Buying the wrong part will halt your repair.

For tools, you will need a few basic items. A screwdriver set, including Phillips and flat-head, is essential. Pliers, especially slip-joint pliers, help with hose clamps. A nut driver or socket set will be useful for various bolts. You might need a Torx bit set for some fasteners. A flashlight helps you see in tight spaces. You should also have towels or a wet vacuum for any spilled water. A bucket helps catch water when disconnecting hoses. A multimeter is helpful to test for power and continuity. Safety gloves protect your hands. Safety glasses shield your eyes. Always ensure you have a clear, well-lit workspace. Having these items ready saves time. It also makes the repair process much easier.

### Safety First: Preparing for Your Pump Replacement

Safety is very important when working on any appliance. Before you start to replace your Maytag dishwasher pump, you must take precautions. This protects you from electrical shock and water damage. Skipping these steps can lead to serious injury or property damage. I always make safety my top priority for any home repair.

First and foremost, disconnect the power to the dishwasher. Locate your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. Flip it to the "OFF" position. If labels are unclear, switch off the main breaker. This ensures no electricity reaches the dishwasher during your work. Do not rely on just turning the dishwasher off with its buttons. Power can still be present at the outlet. Always verify power is off before touching any wires.

Next, turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. Look for the shut-off valve under your kitchen sink. It is usually a small handle or knob on the water line connected to the dishwasher. Turn it clockwise until the water flow stops. If you cannot find a dedicated valve, you might need to turn off the main water supply to your house. Once the water is off, open the dishwasher door. Run a cycle for a few seconds. This helps release any remaining water pressure in the lines. Have towels ready. Some residual water will likely spill when you disconnect hoses. Place a shallow pan or bucket under the dishwasher connections. This catches any drips. Completing these safety steps makes the entire process safer and cleaner.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Replacing the Maytag Dishwasher Pump

Replacing the Maytag dishwasher pump requires careful steps. Follow these instructions precisely. This ensures a successful repair. Take your time with each stage.

#### 1. Disconnect and Pull Out the Dishwasher

First, ensure power and water are off as discussed in the safety section. Then, disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain or garbage disposal. Use pliers to loosen the clamp if needed. Unscrew the water supply line from the dishwasher's inlet valve. Use a wrench if necessary. Next, unscrew the power junction box cover. Disconnect the electrical wires. Note which wire goes where, or take a picture. My personal experience is that photos help immensely with reassembly. Carefully pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet space. You might need to adjust the leveling legs.

#### 2. Access the Pump Assembly

Lay the dishwasher on its back or side. This gives you clear access to the bottom. Locate the sump and pump assembly underneath. You will see several hoses and wires connected to it. Take pictures before you remove anything. These photos serve as a guide for putting it back together. You might need to remove a metal base plate. This plate often secures with screws. Removing it reveals the pump more fully. Some models might require removing the wash motor first. This is usually attached to the pump.

#### 3. Remove the Old Pump

Identify the hoses connected to the pump. There will be a drain hose and possibly a wash hose. Use pliers to loosen the clamps on these hoses. Pull the hoses off carefully. Some water may spill, so have towels ready. Disconnect any electrical wiring leading to the pump motor. These often have clips or quick-disconnect terminals. Note the wire colors and their positions. Unscrew any mounting brackets or clamps holding the pump in place. The pump assembly will then separate from the dishwasher sump. For some Maytag models, the circulation pump assembly may require slightly different steps. [Referencing how to replace a Maytag dishwasher circulation pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-maytag-dishwasher-circulation-pump) can provide model-specific tips if yours is a circulation pump.

#### 4. Install the New Pump

Inspect the new pump. Make sure it matches the old one. If there are any gaskets or seals, ensure they are in place on the new pump. Install the new pump assembly into the sump. Make sure it sits securely. Fasten any mounting brackets or clamps. Reconnect the electrical wires to the new pump. Match the connections exactly as they were on the old pump. Push the hoses back onto their corresponding ports on the new pump. Secure them tightly with the hose clamps. Double-check all connections. Loose connections can cause leaks or prevent proper operation.

#### 5. Reassemble and Test

Once the new pump is installed, put the base plate back on if you removed it. Carefully slide the dishwasher back into its cabinet space. Reconnect the power wires in the junction box. Reattach the water supply line to the inlet valve. Connect the drain hose to the sink drain or garbage disposal. Turn the water supply back on. Turn the circuit breaker back on. Run a short test cycle. Watch for any leaks around the new pump or hoses. Listen for unusual noises. Check if the dishwasher drains properly and washes effectively. If everything looks good, you have successfully replaced your Maytag dishwasher pump.

### Maintenance Tips for Your Dishwasher Pump

Maintaining your Maytag dishwasher pump helps extend its life. It also keeps your dishwasher running smoothly. Regular care prevents common issues. This reduces the need for frequent repairs. Simple steps can make a big difference. I find that proactive maintenance saves a lot of trouble.

First, regularly clean your dishwasher filter. Food particles and debris often get trapped in the filter. This can block the pump. A clogged filter makes the pump work harder. Over time, this causes the pump to fail. Most Maytag models have an accessible filter at the bottom of the tub. [Cleaning your Maytag dishwasher filter is a simple process](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-dishwasher-filter-maytag). I recommend cleaning it once a month. Rinse it under running water. Remove any stubborn debris. You can also use a soft brush.

Second, avoid putting large food scraps into the dishwasher. Scrape plates thoroughly before loading them. Large pieces of food, bones, or foreign objects can damage the pump impeller. These items can also clog the pump. This leads to poor draining or circulation. Running a cleaning cycle with a dishwasher cleaner product helps. These products break down grease and mineral buildup. This keeps the pump and hoses clear.

Finally, periodically check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. A restricted drain hose can stress the pump. This can cause it to overheat or fail prematurely. Ensure the hose has a proper air gap. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Following these maintenance tips keeps your Maytag dishwasher pump in good condition. It ensures your dishes stay clean for years to come.
