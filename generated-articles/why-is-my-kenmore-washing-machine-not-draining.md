A Kenmore washing machine not draining usually means a clog in the drain pump or hose. It could also point to a faulty drain pump or a problem with the lid switch. Checking these parts in order helps pinpoint the issue. Most problems are fixable with basic tools and some effort.

### Understanding the Drain Cycle in Your Kenmore Washer

Your Kenmore washing machine uses a specific process to remove water. First, the wash cycle finishes, and then the machine signals to drain. The drain pump activates, pulling water from the tub. This water then travels through the drain hose and out of your home. It sounds simple, but many parts must work together for this to happen.

If any part of this system fails, water stays in the machine. A common cause is a blockage. Lint, small items, or even coins can stop water flow. Sometimes, the pump itself fails. Other times, an electrical issue prevents the pump from turning on. Knowing how this process works helps you find the problem when your Kenmore washing machine is not draining.

Your Kenmore washer follows a precise sequence. The control board sends commands to various parts. When it sends the drain command, the drain pump gets power. It then forces water out of the drum and through the hose. If the machine detects a problem, like an open lid, it might stop the cycle. This means no draining happens.

### Common Reasons Your Kenmore Washing Machine Stops Draining

Several issues can cause your Kenmore washing machine not to drain. One frequent problem is a clogged drain pump filter. This filter catches debris, but it can get full. Another common cause is a kinked or blocked drain hose. The hose carries water out, and if it is bent, water cannot flow.

A faulty drain pump is another big reason. The pump motor might burn out or get jammed. Sometimes, small items like socks or coins get past the filter and into the pump. This stops the impeller from spinning. Problems with the lid switch or door lock can also prevent draining. These safety features stop the machine from running if the door is open.

Electrical issues can affect drainage too. A bad control board or wiring problem might stop the pump from getting power. Also, a malfunctioning water level sensor might incorrectly tell the machine the tub is empty. This would stop the drain cycle. You need to check these parts systematically. This helps you figure out why your Kenmore washing machine is not draining.

### Troubleshooting a Clogged Drain Pump Filter

A clogged drain pump filter is one of the most common reasons a Kenmore washing machine does not drain. This filter collects lint, coins, buttons, and other small items. Over time, these items build up and block water flow. Cleaning this filter is often a simple fix. I always check this first.

To access the filter, you must first unplug your washing machine. This is important for safety. Next, find the access panel at the bottom front of your machine. You might need a screwdriver to open it. Have a shallow pan and towels ready. Water will likely spill out when you open the filter housing.

Slowly unscrew the filter cap. Let the water drain into your pan. Once empty, pull the filter out. Clean off all the lint, debris, and foreign objects. You can rinse it under a faucet. Also, check the housing where the filter sits for any debris. Put the clean filter back in and secure the cap. This simple step often resolves the "Kenmore washing machine not draining" problem. For more detailed instructions on cleaning various filters, you can refer to guides like [How to clean washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter) or specifically [How to clean Kenmore washing machine filter top loader no agitator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-kenmore-washing-machine-filter-top-loader-no-agitator).

### Inspecting the Drain Hose for Kinks or Blockages

The drain hose is a vital part of your Kenmore washing machine's draining system. It carries water from the machine to your laundry tub or standpipe. A common issue is a simple kink in the hose. This often happens if the machine is pushed too close to a wall. You should pull the machine out and visually inspect the entire length of the hose.

Feel along the hose for any hard spots or blockages. Small items, like baby socks, can get trapped inside the hose. This stops water from flowing freely. Disconnect the hose from the standpipe or sink. You might need to use pliers or a screwdriver to loosen clamps. Check the end of the hose for any clogs.

You can also try flushing the hose. Use a garden hose to push water through it. Do this into a bucket or drain to see if water flows freely. If it does not, a blockage is present. You may need to use a snake or a straightened wire hanger to dislodge it. Make sure the hose is not too far down the standpipe, as this can create a siphon effect and cause draining issues. Addressing these hose problems is part of general [Do it yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) troubleshooting.

### Dealing with a Faulty Drain Pump in Your Kenmore Washer

If the filter and hose are clear, the drain pump itself might be the issue. The drain pump is a motor-driven device that forces water out of the tub. Over time, these pumps can wear out or fail. You might hear a humming noise but no water movement, or no sound at all. First, unplug your machine for safety.

You will need to access the drain pump. It is usually at the bottom of the machine, near the front or side. You might need to tilt the machine or remove a panel. Once you find the pump, look for any visible damage. Check the electrical connections to the pump. Make sure they are secure.

You can test the pump for foreign objects. These objects can jam the impeller inside the pump. Remove the hoses connected to the pump. Look inside the pump housing for debris. If you find any, remove it carefully. If the pump is old or shows signs of burning, it likely needs replacement. Replacing a drain pump can restore proper function when your Kenmore washing machine is not draining.

### Checking for Blockages in the Washing Machine Tub or Sump

Sometimes, the blockage is not in the filter or hose. It can be inside the washing machine tub itself or in the sump area. The sump is the lowest point of the tub where water collects before draining. Small items, like undergarments, buttons, or hairpins, can bypass the filter and settle in this area. This prevents water from entering the drain pump correctly.

To check for these blockages, you first need to drain any standing water. You can do this manually using a wet-vac or by bailing water out. Next, you may need to remove parts of the tub. For top-loader Kenmore models, you might need to remove the agitator to access the tub's bottom. Instructions on [How to get agitator out of Kenmore washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-agitator-out-of-kenmore-washing-machine) can be helpful here.

Once you have access, visually inspect the bottom of the tub and the area around the impeller (if visible). Reach in carefully to feel for any obstructions. You might find a foreign object caught in the drain opening. Removing these items can immediately solve your Kenmore washing machine not draining problem. This check is crucial for thorough troubleshooting.

### Addressing Issues with the Lid Switch or Door Lock Mechanism

Modern Kenmore washing machines have safety features. One key feature is the lid switch or door lock. This mechanism tells the machine if the lid or door is closed and latched. If the machine thinks the lid is open, it will not proceed with the spin or drain cycle. This is a safety measure to prevent injury.

If your Kenmore washing machine is not draining, check the lid or door. Make sure it closes completely. Listen for a click sound when you close it. If the switch is faulty, it might not register the closure. You can test the switch with a multimeter if you have one. Unplug the machine first for safety. The switch is usually near the hinge of the lid or door.

A broken lid switch is a common reason for incomplete cycles. Replacing a faulty lid switch is a relatively simple repair. You can often find replacement parts online or at appliance stores. Ensuring this safety mechanism works correctly is vital for proper machine operation. Sometimes, issues like a Kenmore washing machine banging during the spin cycle can also stem from problems with these mechanisms preventing balanced operation.

### Power Supply and Control Board Problems Affecting Drainage

Electrical problems can stop your Kenmore washing machine from draining. The drain pump needs power to operate. If it does not receive power, it will not pump water out. First, check if the washing machine is properly plugged into a working outlet. A tripped circuit breaker can also cut power to the machine. Check your home's breaker box and reset any tripped breakers.

Next, consider the control board. This board is the "brain" of your washing machine. It sends signals to all components, including the drain pump. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the correct signal for draining. You might see error codes on the display. Refer to your Kenmore owner's manual for specific error code meanings.

Diagnosing a bad control board can be tricky. It often requires testing with specialized tools. If the machine has no power, or if it acts erratically, the control board could be the culprit. Repairing or replacing a control board is more complex. It might be a job for a professional technician. Always rule out simpler issues before suspecting the control board.

### Water Level Sensor Malfunctions and Kenmore Drainage

The water level sensor plays a crucial role in your Kenmore washing machine. It tells the control board how much water is in the tub. This sensor helps the machine know when to fill, when to stop filling, and when to drain. If this sensor malfunctions, it might incorrectly report the water level. This can prevent the drain cycle from starting.

For example, if the sensor incorrectly indicates an empty tub, the machine might skip the drain cycle. Or, if it constantly shows a full tub, the machine may try to drain endlessly. This can cause your Kenmore washing machine to appear stuck. You might notice the machine pausing or not advancing through cycles properly. This is similar to [Why is my Kenmore washing machine stuck on sensing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kenmore-washing-machine-stuck-on-sensing).

You can often find the water level sensor connected by a pressure hose to the bottom of the tub. Check this hose for clogs or kinks. A simple blockage in this hose can give false readings. If the hose is clear, the sensor itself might be faulty. Replacing the water level sensor is a task that may require some technical skill. Ensure to unplug the machine before inspecting any components.

### When to Call a Professional for Your Kenmore Washing Machine

Sometimes, you try all the common fixes, and your Kenmore washing machine still does not drain. This is when it is time to consider calling a professional appliance repair technician. Certain issues are too complex or dangerous for a DIY repair. For example, extensive electrical problems or specific control board failures often need expert attention.

A professional has specialized tools and knowledge. They can quickly diagnose problems that are not obvious. They also have access to genuine replacement parts. Trying to fix a complex issue yourself could cause more damage. It could also void your washer's warranty. If you are unsure about any step, or if the problem involves major disassembly, it is safer to call an expert.

Consider the cost of repair versus replacement. A professional can advise you on whether repairing your Kenmore washing machine is cost-effective. They can also explain the specific problem clearly. While some problems, like those affecting [Why is my GE washing machine not draining and spinning](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ge-washing-machine-not-draining-and-spinning) or [Why is my beko washing machine not spinning or draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-beko-washing-machine-not-spinning-or-draining), often have similar solutions, specific Kenmore parts might require unique expertise. A professional offers peace of mind.

### Preventing Future Draining Issues

Preventing problems is better than fixing them. Regular maintenance can significantly reduce the chance of your Kenmore washing machine not draining. One simple step is to clean the drain pump filter often. I make it a habit to check mine every few months. This stops lint and small items from building up.

Always check pockets before washing clothes. Coins, keys, and paper clips are common culprits for clogs. They can damage the pump. Use mesh laundry bags for small items like socks or delicate undergarments. This prevents them from slipping into the drain system. Also, use the correct amount of detergent. Too much soap can create excessive suds. These suds can slow drainage or confuse sensors.

Ensure your drain hose is free of kinks and properly positioned. Do not push the machine too far back against the wall. Run a cleaning cycle monthly using a washing machine cleaner or vinegar. This helps remove residue that can build up. These simple habits keep your Kenmore washing machine running smoothly. It helps prevent future headaches with drainage.
