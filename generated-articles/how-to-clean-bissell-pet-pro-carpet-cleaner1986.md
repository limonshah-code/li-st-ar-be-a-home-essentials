## Keep Your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986 Spotless

My Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner is an essential tool for maintaining a clean home, especially with furry friends around. It tackles tough pet messes and refreshes carpets, making our living spaces feel new again. But like any hard-working appliance, it needs regular cleaning to perform its best. A dirty machine cannot truly clean your carpets.

Neglecting your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986 leads to several problems. Dirty tanks can harbor bacteria and mold, spreading foul odors instead of removing them. Clogged nozzles reduce suction power, leaving carpets wet and stained. Neglecting the brush rolls can result in hair and debris tangling, making the machine less effective. We must clean our carpet cleaner after each use. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to properly clean your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986. We will cover everything from emptying tanks to deep cleaning brush rolls and hoses. You will learn how to maintain your machine effectively for long-lasting, optimal performance.

### Takeaway

*   Empty dirty water tank immediately after each use.
*   Rinse all removable parts with clean water.
*   Remove and clean brush rolls thoroughly to prevent tangles.
*   Inspect and clear the nozzle for blockages.

### Clean Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986: The Quick Answer

To effectively clean your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986, empty and rinse all tanks immediately after use. Remove and clean the brush rolls, nozzle, and hose to prevent clogs and odors. Wipe down the machine's body and allow all parts to air dry completely before reassembly and storage.

## Why Cleaning Your Bissell Pet Pro 1986 Matters for Pet Homes

Pet owners understand the constant battle against dirt, fur, and accidents on carpets. Our Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986 is a powerful ally in this fight. It extracts deep-seated grime and lifts stubborn pet stains. However, the machine itself accumulates dirt and debris from these cleaning tasks. Over time, this buildup affects its performance.

A dirty carpet cleaner cannot effectively clean carpets. Instead, it can redeposit dirt, pet hair, and even bacteria back onto your floors. This leads to lingering odors and less-than-sparkling results. Proper cleaning ensures your machine continues to provide the deep, refreshing clean you expect. It also extends the lifespan of your valuable appliance. I always make sure to take care of my tools. This practice helps save money on repairs or replacements.

### Understanding Common Issues from Neglect

When you do not clean your Bissell Pet Pro 1986, several issues can arise. The dirty water tank collects grime and pet dander. This creates a breeding ground for mildew and unpleasant smells. These odors can then transfer to your carpet during the next cleaning cycle. The brush rolls, critical for scrubbing, get tangled with pet hair and fibers. This reduces their cleaning efficiency and puts strain on the motor.

The machine's nozzle and hoses can also become clogged. These blockages decrease suction power, leaving excess moisture on your carpet. This dampness contributes to longer drying times and potential mold growth. Regular maintenance prevents these common problems. It ensures your Bissell Pet Pro 1986 operates at peak performance, keeping your home truly clean and fresh. Remember, the cleaner your machine, the cleaner your home will be.

## Essential Tools and Safety for Bissell Cleaner Maintenance

Before you begin cleaning your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986, gather the right tools. Having everything ready makes the process smoother and more efficient. I keep a dedicated cleaning kit for my carpet cleaner. You will need basic items that are likely already in your home. This preparation prevents interruptions during the cleaning process.

First, you need a sink or bathtub with running water. This provides a space to rinse components. A small brush or old toothbrush helps scrub stubborn grime from intricate parts. A pair of scissors can cut away tangled hair from the brush rolls. You also need a clean cloth or paper towels for wiping surfaces. Dish soap or a mild cleaner can assist with heavily soiled areas. These simple tools ensure a thorough clean.

### Prioritizing Your Safety During Cleaning

Safety is always important when handling appliances. Always unplug your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986 before you start any cleaning or maintenance. This prevents accidental activation. It removes any risk of electric shock. Never submerge the main motor unit in water. This part contains electrical components. Water can cause serious damage.

Wear gloves if you have sensitive skin. Cleaning solutions or dirty water might irritate your hands. Work in a well-ventilated area, especially if using any cleaning agents. Make sure to read your specific Bissell Pet Pro 1986 user manual for any unique safety instructions. This ensures you clean your machine effectively and without harm. Taking these precautions protects both you and your appliance.

## Disassembling and Emptying Tanks of Your Pet Pro 1986

The first step in cleaning your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986 is to prepare it. This involves turning off the machine and unplugging it from the power outlet. Safety always comes first when working with any electrical appliance. Never attempt to clean it while it is plugged in. Once unplugged, you can start removing the tanks.

Your Bissell Pet Pro 1986 has two main tanks: a clean water tank and a dirty water tank. Start by removing the dirty water tank. It usually sits at the front or side of the machine. Carefully lift it off its base. Be mindful that it might be heavy if full. Carry it to a sink or toilet. Pour out all the dirty water. You will see all the grime it picked up from your carpet.

### Rinsing and Sanitizing the Tanks

After emptying the dirty water tank, rinse it thoroughly with warm, clean water. Swirl the water around inside. Pour it out. Repeat this several times until the water runs clear. Pay attention to any remaining debris or pet hair. Sometimes, I use a small brush to scrub the inside of the tank. This ensures no residue remains.

For an even deeper clean, you can use a mild dish soap solution. Add a few drops of soap and warm water to the tank. Shake it well. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, rinse it out completely. Make sure no soap residue stays behind. You also need to clean the clean water tank, even though it only holds clean water and solution. Rinse it out to remove any potential mineral buildup or old solution residue. Always let both tanks air dry completely. This prevents mold and mildew growth inside them. A clean tank means clean water going onto your carpet.

## Cleaning the Brush Rolls and Nozzle of Your Bissell Pet Pro 1986

The brush rolls are crucial for scrubbing and lifting dirt from your carpets. They are also magnets for pet hair and debris. If these brushes become matted or tangled, your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986 will not clean effectively. Regular cleaning of these parts is essential for optimal performance. I always tackle this step carefully.

To access the brush rolls, you usually need to remove the nozzle assembly or a cover plate on the front of the machine. Consult your specific Bissell Pet Pro 1986 manual for exact instructions. Some models have quick-release brush rolls. Others require a screwdriver. Once exposed, carefully lift out the brush rolls. You will likely see a significant amount of pet hair and carpet fibers wrapped around them. This is normal.

### Detangling and Rinsing Brush Rolls

Use a pair of scissors to carefully cut away any tangled hair or thread from the brush rolls. Be gentle to avoid damaging the bristles. Pull out any remaining debris with your hands. Once clear of large tangles, rinse the brush rolls under running water. Use an old toothbrush or a small scrubbing brush to remove embedded dirt and grime from the bristles. Ensure all bristles are free of residue.

Next, focus on the nozzle. The nozzle is the clear or semi-clear part that touches the carpet. It helps suction up dirty water. Check for any clogs or blockages in the suction path. These can be caused by pet hair, debris, or dried-up solution. Remove any obstructions you find. Rinse the nozzle thoroughly with warm water. You can even run water through the suction path to ensure it is clear. Allow the brush rolls and nozzle to air dry completely before putting them back into the machine. This step is critical for preventing mildew and maintaining strong suction.

## Maintaining Hoses, Attachments, and Filters on Your Bissell Cleaner

Your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986 often comes with various hoses and attachments. These tools help clean stairs, upholstery, and tight spots. Just like the main machine, these accessories collect dirt, pet hair, and dirty water residue. Neglecting them can lead to clogs and bad odors. I make sure to clean these extra parts every time I use them.

Start by detaching all hoses and handheld tools from the main unit. Most hoses have a quick-release mechanism. Inspect each attachment for visible dirt or debris. Pay close attention to the nozzles of upholstery tools. These small openings can easily become clogged. A blocked attachment cannot clean effectively. It can also reduce the overall suction of your machine.

### Cleaning Hoses and Attachments

Rinse hoses under warm, running water. You can even run water through the hose itself to flush out any internal debris. For stubborn blockages, try using a long, flexible brush specifically designed for cleaning hoses. Ensure the water runs clear through the entire length of the hose. Handheld tools and attachments should also be rinsed thoroughly. Use a small brush to scrub any areas with dried-on grime.

Some Bissell models also have filters that require cleaning. These filters prevent debris from entering the motor. Locate any filters on your Bissell Pet Pro 1986. They are often near the dirty water tank or motor housing. Remove them carefully. Rinse them under cool water until they are clean. Allow all hoses, attachments, and filters to air dry completely before reattaching them. A damp hose can promote mildew growth, leading to foul odors during your next cleaning session. This thorough cleaning ensures all parts of your machine work in harmony.

## Deep Cleaning the Machine's Body and Components

After you have cleaned the removable parts, it is time to focus on the main body of your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986. This part of the machine houses the motor and electrical components. It needs careful attention. You cannot submerge it in water. We still need to remove surface grime and spills effectively.

Start by wiping down the exterior of the machine with a damp cloth. You can use a mild all-purpose cleaner if there are sticky spots or significant grime. Pay attention to the handle, wheels, and any crevices where dirt might accumulate. Pet hair often clings to the plastic surfaces. Make sure to remove all traces of this. A clean exterior reflects a well-maintained machine.

### Addressing Interior Components and Connections

While you cannot rinse the main body, you can still clean specific interior areas. Look for the area where the dirty water tank sits. This basin can collect residual dirty water and grime. Wipe it out thoroughly with a damp cloth. Use a small brush or cotton swab to clean tight spots and corners. This prevents odor-causing bacteria from building up.

Check all connection points for hoses and attachments. Ensure they are free of debris. Sometimes, dried-up solution can build up around these seals. Gently scrape it away. This ensures a tight seal for optimal suction. Allow all wiped surfaces to air dry completely before moving on. This prevents moisture from seeping into electrical parts. Taking the time to deep clean these areas helps maintain the overall hygiene and function of your Bissell Pet Pro 1986.

## Reassembly, Storage, and Preventing Future Buildup

Once all parts of your Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner 1986 are clean and thoroughly dry, it is time for reassembly. This step is important. You must put everything back correctly for the machine to work properly. I always double-check my work. Start by carefully reinserting the brush rolls. Make sure they click securely into place. Then, reattach the nozzle assembly or cover plate.

Next, place the clean water tank and the dirty water tank back onto the main unit. Ensure they are seated firmly. Reattach any hoses, filters, and attachments. Listen for clicks or feel for secure connections. A loose part can affect performance. It can also cause leaks. Take your time with this step. Proper reassembly means your machine is ready for its next use.

### Smart Storage and Maintenance Tips

Store your clean Bissell Pet Pro 1986 in a dry, temperate area. Avoid extreme heat or cold. These conditions can damage plastic components or internal mechanisms. Do not store it in a damp garage or basement, as this can encourage mildew growth. Keep it upright to prevent any accidental spills. Proper storage ensures your machine remains in good condition between uses.

To prevent future buildup, always empty and rinse both tanks immediately after each use. This is the most important habit for maintaining your cleaner. Periodically, check the brush rolls for tangled hair and remove it. Consider using a good quality cleaning solution that is compatible with Bissell machines. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach, as they can damage your machine and carpets.

### What causes a bad smell coming from my carpet cleaner?
A bad smell usually comes from neglected dirty water tanks, brush rolls, or hoses. Pet dander, dirt, and stale water create a breeding ground for bacteria and mildew. These then produce foul odors. Thorough cleaning and complete drying of all components after each use will eliminate the source of these smells.

### How do I remove tangled pet hair from the brush rolls?
To remove tangled pet hair from the brush rolls, first, unplug your machine and remove the brush rolls. Use a pair of scissors to carefully cut through the matted hair. Then, pull out the loosened hair by hand. Rinse the brushes under running water and use a small brush to scrub off any remaining debris.
