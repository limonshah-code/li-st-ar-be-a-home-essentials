The "watertap" symbol on a Bosch dishwasher means the appliance detects a problem with its water supply. This specific symbol shows the dishwasher is not receiving enough water to complete its washing cycle. It alerts you to an issue with water intake, flow, or pressure.

## Decoding the Bosch Dishwasher Watertap Indicator

When your Bosch dishwasher displays the "watertap" symbol, it is sending a clear message. The machine indicates that it has encountered a problem with its water supply. This symbol looks like a small faucet or tap, sometimes with a cross through it or accompanied by an error code. It tells you the dishwasher is not filling with water as it should.

This problem can stop your wash cycle dead in its tracks. A Bosch dishwasher needs a consistent and adequate water flow to clean your dishes effectively. Without enough water, detergent cannot dissolve properly, and dishes will not get clean. Ignoring this signal can lead to incomplete cycles and poor cleaning performance. Understanding this symbol is the first step toward a solution.

### Why Your Bosch Dishwasher Displays the Watertap Symbol

The "watertap" symbol serves as a warning, signaling an issue with the water intake. Many factors can trigger this alert. It often relates to the water supply line itself or components within the dishwasher responsible for water intake. This symbol protects your appliance by preventing it from running without enough water, which could damage internal parts.

The system performs checks at different stages of the wash cycle. If water flow is too low or stops entirely, the dishwasher displays the watertap symbol. It then pauses operation, waiting for you to address the underlying cause. Troubleshooting this issue often requires a systematic check of various components. We will guide you through these checks in the following sections.

## Common Reasons for the Bosch Watertap Error

The "watertap" error on your Bosch dishwasher points to a water supply problem. Several common issues can cause this symbol to appear. It helps to understand these causes to diagnose the problem quickly. Most of these issues are fixable with basic tools and some effort.

Let's look at the most frequent culprits behind this warning. Identifying the correct cause saves you time and effort in repairs. Always start with the simplest checks and move to more complex ones. This approach is efficient and logical.

### Low Water Pressure in Your Home

One of the most common reasons for the "watertap" symbol is low water pressure. Your Bosch dishwasher needs a certain amount of water pressure to fill properly. If the pressure in your home is too low, the dishwasher cannot draw enough water. This can happen if other appliances are running at the same time, like a shower or washing machine.

You can test your home's water pressure by running a faucet nearby. If the water flow seems weak, this might be the problem. Check if the main water valve to your house is fully open. Sometimes, partial closure can significantly reduce pressure. Ensure no other activities are heavily using water during the dishwasher cycle.

### Kinked or Blocked Inlet Hose

The water inlet hose connects your dishwasher to the household water supply. If this hose becomes kinked, bent, or blocked, it restricts water flow. A kink is easy to spot by simply pulling the dishwasher out slightly and visually inspecting the hose. Straighten any kinks you find.

A blockage within the hose is also possible. Mineral deposits or sediment can build up over time. Disconnecting the hose and checking for obstructions might be necessary. You can also run water through the hose into a bucket to check for good flow. A clean, straight hose is vital for proper water intake.

### Clogged Filters or Water Inlet Valve Screen

Your Bosch dishwasher has a small filter screen located where the water inlet hose connects to the dishwasher. This screen catches debris before it enters the machine. Over time, this screen can become clogged with sediment, rust, or other particles. A clogged screen restricts water flow significantly.

You will need to turn off the water supply to the dishwasher before checking this filter. Disconnect the inlet hose from the back of the dishwasher. You will see a small mesh screen inside the inlet port. Carefully remove and clean it under running water with a small brush. Reinstall it and reconnect the hose once clean. This is a simple step that often solves the "watertap" issue.

## Inspecting Your Bosch Dishwasher's Water Supply System

After checking the basic external factors, it is time to look closer at the dishwasher's internal water supply system. Your Bosch dishwasher relies on specific components to manage water intake. If any of these parts fail, the "watertap" symbol will appear. These checks require a bit more attention but are still manageable for many homeowners.

Proper water flow ensures effective cleaning and prevents damage to the appliance. We will examine the water inlet valve, the float switch, and other related components. These steps are crucial for accurate diagnosis.

### Checking the Water Inlet Valve

The water inlet valve is an important part of your Bosch dishwasher. It is an electromagnetic valve that opens to allow water into the dishwasher and closes to stop the flow. If this valve is faulty, it may not open fully or at all. This results in insufficient water, triggering the "watertap" symbol.

To check the valve, first, turn off the power and water supply to the dishwasher. Locate the inlet valve, usually behind the lower access panel where the water hose connects. Look for visible damage or leaks. You can test the valve with a multimeter to check for continuity. If there is no continuity, the valve is likely defective and needs replacement. This task may require professional help if you are not comfortable with electrical testing.

### Examining the Float Switch and Overfill Protection

Inside your Bosch dishwasher, a float switch monitors the water level. This safety feature prevents the dishwasher from overfilling. As water fills the tub, a small float rises. When it reaches a certain level, it activates a switch, signaling the dishwasher to stop filling. If the float switch is stuck in the "up" position, it can trick the dishwasher into thinking it is already full. This prevents more water from entering, causing the "watertap" error.

To check the float switch, remove the lower dish rack and spray arm. You will typically find the float at the bottom of the tub, often covered by a cap. Gently press down on the float to ensure it moves freely. Clean any debris or food particles that might be restricting its movement. Make sure it can go up and down without sticking. A malfunctioning float switch can also be a reason why you might find [water in the bottom of your Bosch dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-bosch-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom).

### Inspecting for Leaks and Water Pan Activation

A leak in your Bosch dishwasher can also lead to the "watertap" symbol. Many Bosch models have a drip pan or base tray with a flood sensor. If water leaks into this pan, the sensor activates, shutting off the water supply to prevent flooding. This safety measure will often trigger the "watertap" indicator.

You will need to pull the dishwasher out and inspect the area underneath for any signs of water. Look for moisture in the base pan. If you find water, you must locate and repair the leak before resetting the sensor. Common leak points include hose connections, the door gasket, or the pump seal. Addressing leaks is important for proper function and avoiding further damage.

## Troubleshooting Specific Bosch Dishwasher Components

When the "watertap" symbol persists, we need to dig deeper into specific components. These parts play a direct role in the water intake and distribution process. Problems here can trick the dishwasher into thinking it lacks water, even if the supply is fine. Troubleshooting these items often requires a bit more technical skill. However, understanding their function helps pinpoint the issue.

Let us explore these internal elements. We will cover the flow meter, spray arms, and the drain pump. Each component contributes to the overall water cycle within your Bosch dishwasher. A fault in any one of them can trigger the dreaded "watertap" indicator.

### Checking the Flow Meter

The flow meter is a small device that measures the amount of water entering your Bosch dishwasher. It tells the control board how much water has filled the tub. If the flow meter is faulty or clogged, it might send incorrect readings. It could report that too little water has entered, even if the actual water level is correct. This discrepancy triggers the "watertap" symbol.

You can often find the flow meter near the water inlet valve or at the bottom of the tub. Inspect it for any visible blockages or damage. Sometimes, mineral deposits can affect its operation. While cleaning might help, a truly defective flow meter often requires replacement. This is usually a job for a service technician, as it involves internal wiring and precise component handling.

### Ensuring Spray Arm Operation and Cleanliness

While not directly related to water intake, clogged spray arms can indirectly cause issues that mimic a "watertap" problem. If the spray arms are blocked, water pressure inside the dishwasher can build up unusually. This might affect the water distribution and potentially confuse the dishwasher's sensors regarding proper water flow. Although less common, it is worth checking.

Remove the upper and lower spray arms from your dishwasher. Inspect the small holes on the arms for any food particles or mineral buildup. Use a toothpick or a small brush to clear any blockages. Rinse them thoroughly under running water. Reinstall them, ensuring they can rotate freely. Keeping your spray arms clean is part of overall dishwasher maintenance, and it can help prevent a variety of wash cycle problems.

### Examining the Drain Pump and Filter System

It might seem counterintuitive, but a problem with the drain pump can sometimes lead to a "watertap" error. If the dishwasher cannot drain properly, residual water might remain in the tub. This can interfere with the float switch or water level sensors during the next fill cycle. The dishwasher might then mistakenly detect an issue with water intake, even if the primary problem is drainage.

First, check the main filter at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Remove it and clean it thoroughly of any food debris or grease. If the filter is clear, inspect the drain pump for blockages. Sometimes, small pieces of glass or food can get lodged in the pump impeller. You might need to remove the lower spray arm and access the pump area. Clearing any blockages can resolve both drainage and potential "watertap" issues.
