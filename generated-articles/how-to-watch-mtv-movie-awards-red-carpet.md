Many streaming services and official websites limit access based on your geographical location. However, there are ways to still catch the glamour. You need to understand how these restrictions work and what tools can bypass them.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a common solution for international viewers. A VPN allows you to connect to servers in other countries. If you choose a server in the United States, your internet traffic appears to originate from the US. This can trick streaming platforms into granting you access. You can then use services like Paramount+ or the MTV website. Remember to choose a reputable VPN service for reliability and security.

*   **How a VPN Works:**
    *   You install the VPN software on your device.
    *   You select a server location, for example, in New York or Los Angeles.
    *   All your internet traffic routes through this server.
    *   Websites and services see your connection as coming from that chosen location.

Some local broadcasters outside the US might also have agreements to show the MTV Movie & TV Awards. Check local TV guides in your country. MTV has international branches in many regions. These local MTV channels might air the red carpet pre-show or a condensed version of it. This is often the simplest way if available.

*   **Check Local MTV Channels:** Search for "MTV [Your Country]" to see if they broadcast the event live.
*   **Official MTV International Websites:** Some MTV international sites might offer localized streaming.
*   **Social Media for International Updates:** Follow MTV's global social media accounts. They sometimes announce international viewing options.

Be aware that not all VPNs work perfectly with all streaming services. Some services actively try to block VPN connections.
