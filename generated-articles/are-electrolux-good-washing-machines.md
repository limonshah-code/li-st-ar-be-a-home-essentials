## Maintenance Tips for Your Electrolux Washing Machine

Proper maintenance is key to extending the life of your Electrolux washing machine. It also helps ensure consistent cleaning performance. Regular care prevents common problems and keeps your appliance running efficiently. Neglecting maintenance can lead to issues.
