## Unveiling the Cost: How Much Is a Sharp Microwave?

Buying a new kitchen appliance often involves looking at both features and price. Many people consider Sharp when they need a reliable microwave. Knowing "How much is a Sharp microwave?" is a common first step for shoppers. Sharp offers many models. These models range from simple countertop units to advanced convection ovens.

The price of a Sharp microwave changes based on several factors. These factors include size, power, features, and installation type. I will explore the typical cost range for different Sharp microwave models. This article will help you understand what you get for your money. We will also look at where to find the best deals. By the end, you will know how to budget for your next Sharp microwave.

### Takeaway

*   **Sharp microwave prices vary widely:** Expect to pay from $100 for basic models to over $800 for premium, feature-rich units.
*   **Key factors influence cost:** Size, wattage, features like convection or grilling, and installation type significantly affect the final price.
*   **Different types have different ranges:** Countertop models are generally most affordable, while drawer and built-in models are the most expensive.
*   **Shop smart for deals:** Retailer sales, bundled offers, and comparing prices can help you find a great value.

Sharp microwave prices typically range from $100 for a basic, compact countertop model to over $800 for a large, feature-rich convection, over-the-range, or built-in drawer unit. The cost depends on the model's capacity, power output (wattage), specialized cooking functions, and installation style.

## Factors Influencing Sharp Microwave Pricing

Sharp offers a diverse selection of microwaves. The price you pay for a Sharp microwave depends on many things. Understanding these factors helps you make a smart buying decision. I will explain the main elements that affect the cost.

### Size and Capacity

Microwave size impacts its price. Smaller Sharp microwaves usually cost less. These are good for single people or small apartments. Larger microwaves have more interior space. They can fit bigger dishes. These models are more expensive because they require more materials and offer greater convenience.

Capacity is measured in cubic feet. A 0.7 cubic foot model costs less than a 2.0 cubic foot model. Think about your family size and typical cooking needs. This helps you choose the right capacity without overspending.

### Power Output (Wattage)

Microwave power is measured in watts. Higher wattage means faster and more even cooking. A Sharp microwave with 1100-1200 watts costs more than one with 700-900 watts. More power requires stronger components. This drives up the manufacturing cost.

Most people find 900-1000 watts sufficient for daily use. If you cook often or need quick results, higher wattage might be worth the extra expense. I always check the wattage before buying. It tells you a lot about the appliance's performance.

### Key Features and Technology

Modern Sharp microwaves come with many features. These features add to the price. Basic models only offer simple heating. Advanced models include options like sensor cooking. Sensor cooking adjusts time based on food moisture. Other features are convection baking and grilling.

A Sharp convection microwave oven costs more because it can bake and roast like a traditional oven. The grill function also adds to the price. If you want to use your microwave for more than just reheating, expect a higher price tag. Consider which features you will actually use. Many people find the grill function very useful for browning foods. You can learn more about [how to use Sharp microwave grill](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-sharp-microwave-grill) for specific dishes. For baking, Sharp convection models are quite versatile. You can find out [how to bake in Sharp microwave oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-bake-in-sharp-microwave-oven).

### Design and Installation Type

The way a Sharp microwave installs affects its price. Countertop models are the least expensive. You simply place them on your counter. Over-the-range (OTR) models are more costly. They include a vent fan and light, saving counter space.

Built-in microwaves blend into cabinetry. They cost more due to special trim kits and installation requirements. Sharp drawer microwaves are the most premium option. They pull out like a drawer and offer sleek integration. Each type of installation caters to different kitchen designs and budgets.

### Material and Build Quality

The materials used in a Sharp microwave influence its durability and price. Models with stainless steel exteriors or advanced interior coatings usually cost more. These materials offer better aesthetics and easier cleaning. They also tend to last longer.

Higher build quality often means better components inside. This leads to a longer lifespan for the appliance. Investing in a higher quality model can save you money on repairs or replacements in the long run. I always think about how long I expect the appliance to last.

## Sharp Countertop Microwaves: Price Range and Features

Sharp countertop microwaves are popular choices. They offer convenience and flexibility. These models are generally the most affordable Sharp microwaves. They are a good starting point for many budgets.

### Entry-Level Countertop Models

You can find Sharp countertop microwaves for around $100 to $150. These models typically have a capacity between 0.7 and 1.1 cubic feet. Their power output usually ranges from 700 to 900 watts. They are perfect for basic reheating and defrosting tasks.

These budget-friendly options come with simple controls. They might have preset buttons for popcorn or beverages. They are good for small kitchens or dorm rooms. I often recommend these for people who just need a reliable microwave without extra frills.

### Mid-Range Countertop Models

Sharp mid-range countertop microwaves cost between $150 and $250. These models offer a larger capacity, usually 1.1 to 1.4 cubic feet. Their wattage is higher, often 1000 to 1100 watts. This power heats food more quickly.

Mid-range options include more advanced features. You might find sensor cooking technology. This feature detects moisture and adjusts cooking time automatically. They also have more specific preset options. Some may even offer express cooking buttons. These models provide a good balance of features and price for average households.

### Premium Countertop Models

High-end Sharp countertop microwaves can cost $250 to $400 or more. These models boast large capacities, up to 2.0 cubic feet. They feature powerful wattages, often 1100 to 1200 watts. Some premium models include convection or grill capabilities.

These microwaves offer sophisticated controls and sleek designs. They might have specific cooking modes for different food types. If you want to use your microwave for more than just heating, these models are an excellent choice. A Sharp convection microwave oven gives you great flexibility. It allows you to bake and roast right in your microwave. Knowing [how to use Sharp convection microwave oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-sharp-convection-microwave-oven) correctly expands your cooking possibilities.

## Sharp Over-the-Range Microwaves: Investment and Benefits

Sharp over-the-range (OTR) microwaves are a common choice for many kitchens. They save counter space. These models combine a microwave and a range hood into one unit. They cost more than countertop models but offer significant benefits.

### Typical Price Range for OTR Models

Sharp OTR microwaves usually cost between $250 and $500. The price depends on the specific features and power. These units install above your stove. They vent smoke and odors from your cooking area. This dual function adds to their value and price.

Installation costs might add to the total expense. You may need professional help to install an OTR microwave. This can add $100-$200 or more to the overall investment. Always factor in installation when budgeting for an OTR model.

### Features That Drive OTR Prices

Higher-priced Sharp OTR microwaves offer better ventilation power. They might have multiple fan speeds and stronger CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) ratings. Better ventilation means a cleaner kitchen environment. They also often feature larger capacities, typically 1.6 to 2.0 cubic feet.

Some OTR models include convection cooking or grilling elements. These features provide more versatile cooking options. For example, you can grill vegetables or even toast bread directly in your microwave. Mastering [how to grill in Sharp microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-grill-in-sharp-microwave) can open up new culinary possibilities. Sensor cooking is also common in higher-end OTR models. This convenience feature ensures your food cooks perfectly without constant monitoring.

### Benefits of Choosing an OTR Microwave

The main benefit of a Sharp OTR microwave is saving counter space. This is very important in smaller kitchens. They provide efficient ventilation for cooking fumes. They also offer task lighting for your stovetop. These integrated features create a more streamlined kitchen look.

OTR models are designed for heavy use. They typically have durable construction. They are a good long-term investment for many homes. I find that the added functionality and space-saving aspects justify the higher price for most homeowners.

## Sharp Built-in and Drawer Microwaves: Premium Options and Costs

Sharp offers premium microwave options designed for seamless kitchen integration. These are built-in models and drawer microwaves. They offer a sleek look and advanced functionality. They come with a higher price tag compared to countertop or OTR units.

### Built-in Microwave Price Range

Sharp built-in microwaves are designed to fit into custom cabinetry. They create a clean, integrated appearance. These models typically cost from $400 to $700. The price includes the microwave unit itself. It often includes a trim kit needed for a finished look.

Installation for built-in models can be more complex. You might need professional installation. This adds to the overall cost. Built-in units are popular in modern kitchen designs. They offer a custom aesthetic that many homeowners desire.

### Drawer Microwave Costs and Features

Sharp drawer microwaves are the most premium microwave option. They slide open like a drawer. You can install them below a counter or in an island. These models are highly sought after for their convenience and aesthetic appeal. They usually cost between $600 and $1,200.

Sharp drawer microwaves feature unique designs. They have top-loading access, making it easy to place and remove dishes. They often include advanced sensor cooking technology. Some models even have automatic drawer open and close functions. Their innovative design and high functionality explain their higher price point. This microwave type is ideal for island installations or for people with mobility challenges.

### Why Premium Microwaves Cost More

The higher price for built-in and drawer Sharp microwaves reflects their specialized design. They use more sophisticated engineering. They also offer enhanced integration into kitchen cabinetry. These appliances are built for durability and convenience. They feature high-quality materials and precise mechanisms.

These premium models often come with higher wattage and more advanced cooking modes. They are an investment in your kitchen's design and functionality. For many, the seamless look and ease of use justify the higher cost. I see them as a way to elevate the entire kitchen's appeal.

## Where to Buy Sharp Microwaves: Pricing Across Retailers

Finding the right Sharp microwave also means finding the right place to buy it. Prices can vary significantly between different retailers. Knowing where to shop helps you get the best deal. I will discuss common places to buy Sharp microwaves and what to expect.

### Major Appliance Retailers

Large appliance stores like Best Buy, Lowe's, and Home Depot are common places to buy Sharp microwaves. These stores often have a wide selection of models. They offer competitive prices. You can usually see the models in person. This helps you judge size and appearance.

These retailers frequently run sales and promotions. Look for holiday sales or clearance events. They also offer installation services for OTR and built-in models. This can simplify your purchase. Comparing prices across these big stores is a good first step.

### Online Retailers

Websites like Amazon, Wayfair, and the official Sharp website also sell microwaves. Online shopping offers convenience and a vast selection. You can easily compare many models and read customer reviews. Prices online can sometimes be lower due to fewer overhead costs.

However, remember to check shipping fees. Also, consider return policies. Large items might have higher shipping costs. It is important to confirm the warranty and support available when buying online. Sharp has a warranty period that protects your purchase. Understanding [how long is Sharp microwave warranty](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-is-sharp-microwave-warranty) is key before finalizing your order.

### Department Stores and Wholesale Clubs

Department stores like Macy's or Kohl's might carry a limited selection of Sharp microwaves. Their prices can sometimes be higher, but they may offer store-specific discounts or loyalty programs. Wholesale clubs such as Costco or Sam's Club often have great deals. They usually sell a few popular models at lower prices.

Wholesale clubs might require a membership. Their selection is usually smaller. However, if they have the model you want, it could be a very good value. I often check these places for significant savings.

### Local Independent Appliance Stores

Local appliance stores might offer a personalized shopping experience. They can provide expert advice. Sometimes, they can match prices from larger retailers. They might also offer specialized installation or repair services. Building a relationship with a local store can be beneficial for future appliance needs.

While their initial prices might seem higher, consider the added service. They might also offer unique models not found elsewhere. Supporting local businesses is another advantage.

## Comparing Sharp Microwave Prices with Competitors

When considering a Sharp microwave, it is helpful to see how its prices compare to other brands. Many companies make microwaves. Each brand has its own price points and feature sets. I will compare Sharp with some well-known competitors. This helps you understand Sharp's position in the market.

### Sharp vs. Entry-Level Brands (e.g., Farberware, RCA)

Entry-level brands like Farberware or RCA often offer microwaves at lower prices. You can find their basic models for under $100. Sharp's entry-level models typically start around $100-$120. While Sharp might be slightly more expensive at the very basic end, it often offers better build quality or a few more features for that small price difference.

Sharp's basic models tend to be more durable. They often have better sensor cooking capabilities. For a small increase in cost, Sharp provides a step up in reliability and convenience.

### Sharp vs. Mid-Range Brands (e.g., Panasonic, Samsung, LG)

Panasonic, Samsung, and LG are strong competitors in the mid-range market. Their countertop and OTR models often compete directly with Sharp. Prices for these brands' mid-range models are usually between $150 and $450. Sharp's pricing in this segment is very competitive.

Sharp often stands out with its sensor cooking technology. Its inverter technology provides more consistent power. This leads to more even cooking. While other brands have similar features, Sharp's focus on precise cooking is a key differentiator. Many users value the consistency of Sharp.

### Sharp vs. Premium Brands (e.g., Bosch, Miele, Wolf)

High-end brands like Bosch, Miele, or Wolf specialize in premium built-in appliances. Their drawer and built-in microwaves can easily cost $1,000 to $2,000 or more. Sharp's premium drawer and built-in models are typically in the $600 to $1,200 range. This makes Sharp a more affordable premium option.

Sharp offers similar high-end features and sleek designs. They do this at a lower price point than ultra-premium brands. If you want a built-in or drawer microwave without spending a fortune, Sharp provides excellent value. They give you premium aesthetics and performance without the highest price tag.

## Is a Sharp Microwave Worth the Investment?

Deciding if a Sharp microwave is a good investment involves looking beyond the initial price. You need to consider durability, features, and overall value. I believe Sharp microwaves often offer excellent value for their cost.

### Durability and Longevity

Sharp has a reputation for making reliable appliances. Their microwaves are generally well-built. Many users report their Sharp microwaves lasting for many years. Investing in a slightly more expensive Sharp model can mean fewer repairs and a longer lifespan. This saves you money in the long run.

A microwave that lasts longer reduces your need for frequent replacements. This lowers the total cost of ownership. I always look for appliances known for their durability. Sharp often fits this bill.

### Performance and Features

Sharp microwaves are known for their strong performance. Their sensor cooking technology is often praised for its accuracy. Convection and grill models offer versatile cooking options. This allows you to do more than just reheat leftovers. For instance, you can use convection mode to preheat your oven quickly for baking. Understanding [how to preheat Sharp microwave oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-preheat-sharp-microwave-oven) properly helps achieve optimal cooking results.

These features add convenience and functionality to your kitchen. They make your cooking life easier. The ability to grill, bake, and defrost efficiently makes a Sharp microwave a valuable kitchen tool. You can even defrost a variety of foods effectively. Learning [how to defrost in Sharp microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-defrost-in-sharp-microwave) is simple and quick.

### Value for Money

Considering its quality, features, and durability, a Sharp microwave often presents good value for money. While some models might be more expensive than generic brands, the enhanced performance and reliability justify the extra cost. You are paying for a well-engineered appliance.

Sharp offers models across various price points. This means you can find a Sharp microwave that fits your budget without compromising too much on quality. I find that Sharp often delivers more features and better reliability than similarly priced competitors. For me, it is a smart choice for long-term satisfaction.

## Tips for Finding the Best Deal on a Sharp Microwave

Buying a Sharp microwave involves more than just picking a model. You can often save money by shopping smartly. I have a few tips that can help you find the best deal. These strategies apply whether you are buying a basic or a premium model.

### Shop During Sales Events

Major holidays are excellent times to buy appliances. Look for sales around Black Friday, Cyber Monday, President's Day, Memorial Day, and Fourth of July. Retailers often offer significant discounts during these periods. You might find last year's models on clearance, too.

Signing up for email newsletters from appliance stores can alert you to upcoming sales. Planning your purchase around these events can save you a lot of money. I always mark these dates on my calendar.

### Compare Prices Across Retailers

Do not buy the first Sharp microwave you see. Use online price comparison tools. Check prices at major appliance stores, online retailers, and even wholesale clubs. A quick search can reveal significant price differences for the same model.

Some stores offer price matching. If you find a lower price at a competitor, ask if your preferred store will match it. This can save you time and money. I always compare at least three different stores.

### Look for Open-Box or Refurbished Units

Some retailers sell open-box or refurbished Sharp microwaves. Open-box items are usually returns that are still in new condition. Refurbished units have been repaired and tested. These can offer substantial savings, sometimes 10-30% off the original price.

Always check the warranty and return policy for these items. Ensure they come with a guarantee. Inspect the unit for any visible damage if buying in person. This can be a great way to get a high-end model for less.

### Consider Bundling or Package Deals

If you are buying other kitchen appliances, ask about package deals. Sometimes, retailers offer discounts when you purchase multiple appliances from the same brand or store. This can be especially useful if you are renovating your kitchen.

While you might not need a full suite of Sharp appliances, sometimes a microwave and a small appliance bundle could save money. Always ask about any current promotions.

### Utilize Manufacturer Rebates

Sharp, like other manufacturers, occasionally offers rebates. These are partial refunds on your purchase. Check the Sharp website or ask your retailer about any current rebate programs. You usually need to fill out a form and mail it in after your purchase.

Rebates can further reduce the final cost of your Sharp microwave. Make sure you submit all necessary paperwork by the deadline. It's an easy way to get some money back.
