## How To Clean Moldy Money Safely and Effectively

Have you ever discovered a forgotten stash of cash only to find it covered in an unwelcome fuzzy growth? Finding mold on your money can be unsettling. It raises questions about health risks, the value of the currency, and how to safely handle it. Mold thrives in damp, dark places, and paper money, made from a blend of cotton and linen, provides an ideal surface for fungal colonies to take root when moisture is present. Dealing with moldy money requires care to protect your health and preserve the integrity of the banknotes.

This guide will walk you through the process of how to clean moldy money. We will cover why mold appears on cash, the essential safety steps to take, and various cleaning methods suitable for different levels of mold contamination. We will also discuss what actions to avoid, when it is best to exchange your money at a bank, and effective strategies to prevent mold from growing on your currency in the future. My goal is to equip you with the knowledge to handle this common household issue with confidence and keep your finances clean and safe.

### Takeaway

*   Always wear protective gear like gloves and a mask before touching moldy money.
*   Use gentle methods like dry brushing or a mild alcohol/vinegar solution for light mold.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals or excessive water that can damage the currency.
*   Air dry money completely in a well-ventilated area after cleaning.
*   Exchange heavily damaged or severely moldy money at a bank if cleaning is not feasible.

**To clean moldy money, carefully brush off loose spores outdoors. Then, gently wipe the banknotes with a cotton swab lightly dampened with isopropyl alcohol or a diluted white vinegar solution. Allow the money to air dry completely in a well-ventilated space, away from direct sunlight or heat, to prevent re-growth and damage.**

## Understanding Mold on Currency: Why it Happens

Mold is a type of fungus. It grows from spores that are always present in the air around us. These spores need specific conditions to grow into visible mold colonies. When it comes to paper money, which is mostly cotton and linen, mold finds an inviting home if the environment is right. The primary factor for mold growth on cash is moisture.

Money stored in damp places is very prone to mold. This includes basements, attics, garages, or even wallets left in humid conditions. A sudden leak or flood can also cause money to become wet and then moldy if not dried quickly. Dark environments also encourage mold growth. If money is tucked away in a drawer or a box, it might not get enough light or air circulation, making it a perfect spot for mold to develop. This is why you often find mold on forgotten bills or old stacks of cash.

The material of currency itself contributes to the problem. Paper, even durable banknote paper, is organic. Mold feeds on organic materials. Once mold starts growing, it can spread quickly, leaving behind unsightly spots and a musty smell. Understanding these conditions helps us prevent mold in the first place and approach cleaning with the right knowledge. Mold on cash is more than just an aesthetic problem; it signals a damp environment that needs attention.

## Essential Safety Precautions When Cleaning Moldy Money

Handling moldy money requires careful attention to safety. Mold spores are tiny and can become airborne easily. Inhaling these spores can cause health problems for some people. Common reactions include allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, red eyes, and skin rash. For individuals with asthma or other respiratory issues, exposure to mold can trigger more severe reactions. My experience shows that proper precautions prevent unnecessary risks.

Before you touch any moldy cash, put on protective gear. I always start with a pair of disposable gloves. These prevent direct skin contact with mold spores. Next, I put on a dust mask or an N95 respirator. This protects my lungs from inhaling spores. If the mold is extensive or if I am particularly sensitive, I might also wear eye protection, like safety glasses, to keep spores out of my eyes.

Work in a well-ventilated area. If possible, take the moldy money outdoors. If that is not an option, open windows and doors to allow fresh air to circulate. You can also use a fan to direct air away from your face and out of the room. After handling the moldy money, remember to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, even if you wore gloves. This extra step helps remove any lingering spores. Discard disposable gloves and masks properly in a sealed bag. Taking these simple steps protects your health. This approach applies to [how to clean mold in shower](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-shower) or [how to clean mold off walls](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-walls) as well. Prioritizing safety makes the entire process safer and more effective for everyone involved. For larger mold issues, like those found when you [clean bathroom mold](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bathroom-mold), professional help might be needed.

## Gentle Methods for Cleaning Slightly Moldy Money

For money with only light mold growth or surface mildew, gentle cleaning methods are often effective. The goal is to remove the mold without damaging the banknote itself. Banknotes are durable, but harsh treatments can rip or fade them. I recommend starting with the least invasive method and progressing if needed. These methods help preserve the currency's condition.

### Dry Brushing Method

This is the simplest and safest first step. Take the moldy money outdoors if possible, or work over a trash can in a well-ventilated room. Use a very soft brush, like a clean, soft-bristled toothbrush or a soft-bristled paintbrush. Gently brush the mold off the surface of the banknote. Be very light with your strokes to avoid damaging the paper fibers. The aim is to remove loose mold spores and surface fuzz. Do not scrub hard. This method is best for mold that has not deeply embedded itself into the money.

### Isopropyl Alcohol Wipe

If dry brushing is not enough, a small amount of isopropyl alcohol can help. Alcohol is a disinfectant and evaporates quickly, which is good for paper currency. Dampen a cotton swab or the corner of a clean, soft cloth with isopropyl alcohol (70% concentration is fine). Do not saturate the swab. Gently dab and wipe the affected areas of the money. Use a fresh part of the swab or cloth for each wipe to avoid spreading spores. The alcohol helps kill mold and remove stains. Let the money air dry completely after wiping. This method is similar to how you might [clean mold off plastic](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-plastic) items, using a careful wipe.

### White Vinegar Solution

White vinegar is a natural anti-fungal agent and another good option for light mold. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a small bowl. Dampen a cotton swab or a clean, soft cloth with this diluted vinegar solution. Again, do not soak the swab. Gently wipe the moldy areas of the money. Vinegar helps kill mold and remove the musty smell. After wiping, allow the money to air dry completely. The vinegar smell will dissipate as it dries. This method is highly effective and widely used for various cleaning tasks, including [how to clean mold with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar) on other surfaces like glass. Always ensure the money is totally dry before storing it.

## Deep Cleaning Techniques for Heavily Molded Currency

When money has heavy mold growth or feels damp and slimy, you need stronger, yet still careful, cleaning methods. These techniques aim to address deep-seated mold without destroying the banknote. It is important to proceed with extreme caution, as more aggressive cleaning increases the risk of damage. Always prioritize safety and good ventilation when dealing with significant mold.

### Hydrogen Peroxide Approach

Hydrogen peroxide is a mild bleaching agent and a good mold killer. For heavily moldy money, you can use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Dampen a cotton swab or a clean cloth very lightly with the peroxide. Gently blot the moldy areas. Do not rub or scrub. Hydrogen peroxide can lighten or fade the currency's ink if used too liberally or left on for too long. Apply sparingly and only to the affected areas. After application, use a separate clean, slightly damp cloth (with just water) to blot away any residue. Then, allow the money to air dry completely and naturally. This method works well for significant mold, much like when you clean tough stains, such as when you might need to [clean moldy caulk](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-moldy-caulk).

### The Dish Soap and Water Method (Use with Caution)

This method is a last resort for very stubborn, heavily soiled moldy money, as water can easily damage currency. Use an extremely small amount of mild liquid dish soap mixed with distilled water. The solution should be mostly water with just a drop or two of soap. Dip a clean cloth or cotton swab into the solution, wring it out almost completely, so it is barely damp. Gently blot the moldy areas. Do not submerge the money in water. The soap helps lift the grime and mold. After blotting, use a fresh, barely damp cloth (with only clean water) to blot away any soap residue. This step is crucial to prevent sticky residue. This technique is similar to approaches taken to clean delicate, mold-affected items, like understanding [how to clean moldy shower curtain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-moldy-shower-curtain) where material integrity is key.

### Drying Moldy Money Safely

Proper drying is critical after any wet cleaning method. Incorrect drying can lead to more mold or damage to the currency. Lay the cleaned banknotes flat on a clean, dry, absorbent surface, such as paper towels or a clean cloth. Ensure the area is well-ventilated. You can place a fan nearby to help circulate air, but do not point it directly at the money. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can fade the ink. Do not use heat sources like hair dryers, ovens, or irons. High heat can shrink, warp, or damage the security features of the money. Allow the money to air dry completely and naturally, which might take several hours or even a full day. Once dry, store the money properly to prevent future mold growth, similar to practices for preventing mold in enclosed spaces like when you [clean moldy refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-moldy-refrigerator).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Cash

When attempting to clean moldy money, knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. Many common cleaning methods for other items can severely damage currency. Paper money, despite its durability, is still a delicate material with specific security features that can be compromised by improper handling. Avoiding these mistakes helps preserve the value and integrity of your banknotes.

First, never put money in a washing machine or dishwasher. The aggressive agitation and prolonged exposure to water and detergents will destroy the banknotes. They will rip, tear, and lose their structure. This kind of rough treatment is guaranteed to make the money unredeemable. Even if the mold is severe, this is not a solution.

Second, do not use harsh chemicals like bleach, strong abrasive cleaners, or undiluted household disinfectants. Bleach, in particular, can strip the color from the money, degrade the paper, and remove security features. It can also leave behind a residue that makes the money feel odd or sticky. These chemicals are too aggressive for the delicate fibers and inks of banknotes. Stick to the milder solutions mentioned earlier.

Third, avoid scrubbing the money vigorously. While you want to remove mold, aggressive scrubbing can tear the paper or rub off the ink and embossed features. Remember, the goal is gentle removal, not abrasion. Use light, dabbing, or wiping motions. Think of it like trying to [clean stains on wood](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stains-on-wood) where you need to be careful not to damage the surface.

Fourth, do not use excessive amounts of water or any liquid. Over-saturating the money will make it fragile and prone to tearing. It also takes much longer to dry, increasing the risk of mold returning or the money developing a permanent musty smell. Use only a barely damp cloth or swab.

Finally, never try to dry money using direct heat. Microwaves, irons, or direct sunlight can cause the money to shrink, warp, or become brittle. They can also damage security threads and watermarks. Always allow money to air dry naturally in a well-ventilated area. Following these guidelines will prevent irreversible damage and increase your chances of successfully restoring your moldy cash.

## Knowing When to Exchange Damaged or Moldy Money

Despite your best cleaning efforts, some moldy money might be too damaged to save. It is important to know when to stop trying to clean it and consider exchanging it. The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), has specific guidelines for what is considered "mutilated currency." Banks also have their own policies for accepting damaged money. Understanding these rules helps you decide the best course of action.

Money is considered mutilated if it is so badly damaged that its value is questionable. This includes money that is torn, defaced, burned, or decomposed. If your moldy money has large sections missing, is disintegrating, or the security features are no longer visible, it likely falls into this category. Cleaning attempts might also worsen its condition if not done carefully. If the mold has caused significant material loss or structural weakness, it is probably beyond simple cleaning.

For money that is merely worn or slightly soiled, commercial banks will usually accept it. They will then send it to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve System handles unfit currency by removing it from circulation and replacing it with new bills. However, if the mold has severely damaged the bill, making it unclear what denomination it is, or if more than half of the bill is missing, a commercial bank might not accept it. In such cases, you might need to submit a claim directly to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

To submit a claim to the BEP, you will need to mail the damaged currency along with a letter explaining how it became damaged. The BEP will examine the money to determine its value. This process can take time, sometimes months. It is always better to contact your local bank first. They can often provide guidance on whether they will accept the money or if you need to go through the BEP. Don't risk further damaging the money if it's already in poor shape; exchange might be the safest option.

## Preventing Future Mold Growth on Paper Money

The best way to deal with moldy money is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Mold needs moisture to grow. Controlling humidity and providing good airflow are key steps. Implementing a few simple storage habits can protect your cash from future mold attacks. These practices also apply to keeping other items mold-free, like preventing mold when you [clean mold under sink](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-under-sink).

First, store your money in a dry, cool environment. Avoid places known for humidity, such as basements, attics, or garages. These areas often have higher moisture levels, creating ideal conditions for mold. Instead, choose a closet, a desk drawer in a living area, or a safe inside a climate-controlled part of your home. A constant, moderate temperature and low humidity are crucial for long-term storage.

Second, consider using desiccants. Desiccants are materials that absorb moisture from the air. Silica gel packets, often found in new shoes or electronics, are common desiccants. You can place a few silica gel packets alongside your stored money. These packets will draw excess moisture from the air, keeping the environment around your cash dry. Replace these packets periodically, as they lose their effectiveness once saturated. You can often recharge silica gel packets by baking them at a low temperature in an oven.

Third, ensure good air circulation around your stored money. Avoid packing money tightly in sealed containers that trap moisture. If you use a container, choose one that allows some airflow, or open it periodically to air out the contents. This is similar to how proper airflow helps when you [clean under a refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-under-a-refrigerator) to prevent moisture build-up. For larger amounts of money, spreading them out or placing them in breathable envelopes rather than a single dense stack can help.

Finally, regularly inspect your stored cash, especially if it is in an area that might experience fluctuating humidity. A quick check every few months can help you spot any early signs of moisture or mold. Early detection allows you to address the issue before it becomes a widespread problem. By being proactive and mindful of storage conditions, you can significantly reduce the risk of mold returning to your money.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can moldy money make you sick?

Yes, moldy money can potentially make you sick, especially if you are sensitive to mold. Inhaling mold spores can cause allergic reactions like sneezing, coughing, watery eyes, and skin irritation. For individuals with asthma, mold exposure can trigger attacks. Those with weakened immune systems may experience more severe respiratory problems. Always wear protective gear when handling moldy cash.

### Is it illegal to clean moldy money?

No, it is not illegal to clean moldy money. It is legal to possess and clean your own currency. The illegality comes into play if you attempt to alter or deface currency to defraud someone or make counterfeit money. Cleaning mold to restore the bill's appearance for legitimate use is perfectly acceptable and legal.

### Will a bank accept moldy money?

Most commercial banks will accept lightly moldy or slightly damaged money. They typically send it to the Federal Reserve for replacement. However, if the money is severely damaged, missing large portions, or its authenticity is questionable due to the mold, a bank might decline to accept it. In such cases, you might need to submit a claim directly to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

### How do banks handle moldy money?

Banks typically handle moldy money as "unfit currency." They will remove it from circulation and send it to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve then processes and destroys the unfit currency. They replace it with new banknotes. This system helps maintain the quality and cleanliness of the money in circulation.

### Can I use bleach on moldy money?

No, you should not use bleach on moldy money. Bleach is too harsh for paper currency. It can strip the ink, damage the paper fibers, and remove security features like watermarks and security threads. This can make the money look discolored or even render it unredeemable. Stick to milder cleaning agents like isopropyl alcohol or diluted white vinegar.
