## How To Level Speed Queen Washing Machine

Is your Speed Queen washing machine shaking? Does it walk across the floor during a spin cycle? An unbalanced washer creates annoying noise and can damage the machine. Learning how to level your Speed Queen washing machine is simple. This guide will help you achieve perfect balance. We cover everything from gathering tools to final testing.

### Takeaway

*   **Gather Tools:** Collect a level, wrench, and shims before starting.
*   **Locate Feet:** Find the machine's leveling legs, usually four of them.
*   **Check Level:** Use a spirit level on top of the washer to find uneven spots.
*   **Adjust Legs:** Turn the adjustable feet to raise or lower each corner.
*   **Lock Nuts:** Tighten the lock nuts after adjustment to secure the legs.
*   **Test Machine:** Run a small load to confirm stability and quiet operation.

### Clear and Concise Answer

You level a Speed Queen washing machine by adjusting its four leveling legs. Use a spirit level on top of the machine. Turn the adjustable feet up or down to bring all sides to a balanced position. Secure the lock nuts once the machine is perfectly stable and does not rock.

### The Importance of a Level Washing Machine

A washing machine works hard. It spins clothes at high speeds. This creates strong vibrations. If your Speed Queen washing machine is not level, these vibrations become a big problem. The machine can shake violently. It might even move across the floor. This "walking" behavior is dangerous. It can damage your floor or walls. It also puts stress on the washing machine's internal parts. Over time, this stress causes wear and tear. This leads to costly repairs. A level machine runs quieter. It lasts longer. It also cleans clothes better because the tub spins correctly.

Many people ignore a small wobble. They think it is normal for a washing machine. This is not true. A properly installed and leveled Speed Queen washing machine should remain stable. It should not make excessive noise. Taking the time to level your appliance pays off. It saves money on energy bills too. An unbalanced load uses more power as the motor struggles. Ensuring your machine is balanced is a core part of proper appliance care. It helps your investment perform at its best.

### Identifying an Unlevel Speed Queen Washer

How do you know if your Speed Queen washing machine needs leveling? The signs are usually clear. The most common sign is excessive vibration. You will hear a loud banging or thumping noise. This noise often gets worse during the spin cycle. Feel the machine. Does it rock back and forth when you push on it? That is another sign. You might also see the machine slowly move from its spot. This "walking" is a major problem.

Another way to check is with a simple test. Open the lid or door. Look at the water inside. If the water settles unevenly, your machine is not level. A truly level machine will hold water perfectly flat. Sometimes, you notice your clothes are still very wet after a cycle. This can happen because an unbalanced tub cannot spin water out effectively. If you have these symptoms, it is time to grab your tools. Checking for level regularly helps prevent these issues. Pay attention to changes in noise or movement. Your washing machine tells you when it needs attention.

### Gathering Your Tools for Leveling

Before you start, gather the right tools. Having everything ready makes the job easier. You will need a good quality spirit level. A 2-foot level is ideal. It covers enough surface area on the washing machine. You also need a wrench. An adjustable wrench works well. This wrench helps loosen and tighten the lock nuts on the leveling legs. Sometimes, you might need shims. Shims are thin pieces of wood or plastic. They help support a leg that does not extend far enough.

Make sure your work area is clear. You might need to move the washing machine slightly. Have someone help you if the machine is heavy. Always unplug the washing machine from the wall outlet first. This prevents any accidental starts. It keeps you safe during the process. Getting your tools ready beforehand saves time. It also prevents frustration. A well-prepared task is a quick task. Being prepared makes the leveling process smooth and efficient.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Leveling Your Speed Queen Washing Machine

Leveling your Speed Queen washing machine is a straightforward process. Follow these steps carefully to ensure your machine is perfectly balanced.

#### Step 1: Unplug and Locate the Legs

Safety comes first. Always unplug your washing machine from the electrical outlet. This prevents electric shock. It also stops the machine from accidentally starting. Your Speed Queen washing machine has four leveling legs. These are usually located at each corner of the base. Look for threaded feet that can be twisted. Most Speed Queen models have two adjustable legs in the front. The rear legs might be self-leveling or also adjustable. Check your specific model's manual for details. Some models require tilting the machine to access rear legs.

#### Step 2: Check the Current Level

Place your spirit level on top of the washing machine. Start by placing it from side to side. Check the bubble in the level. If the bubble is not centered, the machine is uneven. Next, place the level from front to back. Again, check the bubble. Make notes of which corners are high or low. This helps you know which legs need adjustment. You can also press down on each corner of the machine. If it rocks, you know it is not stable. Find the corner that lifts off the floor when you push on the opposite corner. This indicates an unlevel spot.

#### Step 3: Adjust the Front Leveling Legs

The front legs are usually the easiest to adjust. Most Speed Queen washers have adjustable front feet. To adjust them, you will need your wrench. Loosen the lock nut on the leg first. Turn it counter-clockwise to loosen it. Once the lock nut is loose, you can turn the leg itself. Turn the leg clockwise to raise that corner. Turn it counter-clockwise to lower that corner. Make small adjustments. Continuously re-check with your spirit level. Get the front of the machine as level as possible.

Once the front is level, tighten the lock nuts. This secures the legs in place. The lock nut prevents the leg from spinning loose during operation. This is a critical step for long-term stability. A loose lock nut means the machine will quickly become unlevel again.

#### Step 4: Level the Rear Legs (If Applicable)

Some Speed Queen washing machines have self-leveling rear legs. These legs adjust automatically when you tilt the machine. If your model has these, gently tilt the machine forward. Then carefully set it back down. The legs should settle into position. If your rear legs are also adjustable, follow the same process as the front legs. You may need to tilt the machine to access them. Sometimes, you might need help to tilt the machine safely. Place your spirit level on the machine again. Check for level from front to back and side to side. Adjust as needed until the bubble is centered in all directions.

If a leg does not reach the floor, use shims. Slide a shim under the leg until it makes contact. Ensure the shim is firm and stable. Shims are a good temporary fix. They help if your floor is very uneven. Ensure the shims are strong enough to support the machine's weight.

#### Step 5: Test for Stability and Re-adjust

After making your adjustments, give the machine a good shake. Push down on each corner. The machine should not rock at all. If it still rocks, go back to the previous steps. Re-check the level. Make further fine adjustments to the legs. This might take a few tries. Patience is important here. You want the machine to be perfectly stable.

Once you are satisfied with the stability, it is time for a real test. Plug the washing machine back in. Run a small load of laundry. Use a few towels. Observe the machine during the wash and spin cycles. Listen for excessive noise. Watch for any walking or shaking. If it runs quietly and stays put, you have done a good job. If not, repeat the leveling process. Sometimes, the floor itself is the problem. In such cases, a sturdy appliance mat can help. This entire process can be a great [do-it-yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) project.

### When Leveling Isn't Enough: Troubleshooting Persistent Vibrations

Sometimes, even after careful leveling, your Speed Queen washing machine still vibrates excessively. This means the problem is not just about the machine's position. Several other issues can cause a washing machine to shake. Understanding these can save you frustration.

One common cause is an unbalanced load. If you wash one large, heavy item like a rug or a single blanket, it can throw the machine off balance. The machine struggles to distribute the weight evenly. This causes severe shaking during the spin cycle. Always try to balance your loads. Add a few smaller items to balance out a large one. This simple step often solves vibration problems. This is part of proper [Speed Queen washer care](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-speed-queen-washer).

Another issue might be the flooring itself. If your laundry room floor is weak or flexible, it can amplify vibrations. Plywood subfloors on joists can sometimes flex. This movement causes the washing machine to wobble. Consider reinforcing the floor if this is the case. A sturdy rubber mat designed for appliances can also help. It absorbs some of the vibration. This mat creates a more stable base.

Lastly, internal problems can cause vibrations. Worn shock absorbers or suspension springs are common culprits. These parts cushion the tub's movement. If they fail, the tub moves freely, causing loud banging and shaking. A damaged motor mounting or a loose pulley can also cause issues. These problems require professional repair. If you suspect an internal component failure, it might be time to consider professional service. Knowing when to call a technician is important. Sometimes, the problem is more than just external. You can also refer to guides on general machine maintenance like [how to clean your Speed Queen washing machine top loader](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-speed-queen-washing-machine-top-loader) to rule out other issues.

### Maintaining Your Speed Queen's Stability Over Time

Leveling your Speed Queen washing machine is not a one-time task. Over months and years, things shift. The machine vibrates during every cycle. This constant movement can cause the leveling legs to slowly loosen. Floors might settle. This means your perfectly level machine could become unlevel again. Regular checks are important. Make it a habit to check the machine's level every few months. This prevents major issues from developing.

When you check, simply press on each corner of the machine. See if it rocks. If it does, follow the leveling steps again. It only takes a few minutes. Also, avoid overloading your machine. Overloading puts too much stress on the internal components. It also makes the tub unbalanced. This leads to more vibration. You want your Speed Queen to last. It is a durable appliance. Proper care, including keeping it level, extends its life. This proactive maintenance ensures your washing machine continues to run smoothly. It protects your investment. A stable machine means less wear and tear.

### Understanding Your Speed Queen's Design for Optimal Performance

Speed Queen washing machines are known for their commercial-grade quality. They are built to last. Their design includes specific features that aid stability. The heavy-duty suspension system is one key feature. This system is designed to handle large, unbalanced loads better than many other brands. It helps absorb vibrations. However, even with this strong design, proper leveling is still crucial. The suspension system works best when the machine starts on a perfectly level base.

The leveling legs on a Speed Queen are robust. They are designed for easy adjustment. This shows the company's commitment to user-friendly maintenance. Understanding how your machine is built helps you troubleshoot. For instance, knowing if your model has self-leveling rear legs changes how you approach the task. Always check your owner's manual. It provides specific details for your model. It explains the type of legs your machine has. It also gives instructions on how to adjust them. This knowledge helps you perform maintenance correctly. It ensures you get the best performance from your appliance. Getting the most out of your Speed Queen involves understanding its mechanics, from turning it on correctly to knowing how to [turn on your Speed Queen washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-turn-on-speed-queen-washing-machine) and [how much a Speed Queen washing machine costs](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-is-speed-queen-washing-machine), signifying a long-term investment.

### Comparing Speed Queen Leveling to Other Brands

Leveling a washing machine is a common task. Most washing machines use similar leveling principles. They all have adjustable feet. You typically raise or lower these feet to achieve balance. For example, [leveling a Miele washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-level-up-miele-washing-machine) involves similar steps. You check for level and adjust the feet. However, there can be minor differences. Some brands use different types of lock nuts. Some might have all four legs adjustable. Others, like certain Speed Queen models, might have self-leveling rear legs.

The key difference often lies in the build quality. Speed Queen machines are heavier. This extra weight can make them harder to move for initial setup. But it also contributes to their stability once leveled. Lighter machines might be easier to rock out of balance. Always refer to your specific washing machine's manual. Each brand has slight variations in design. Following the manufacturer's instructions is always the best approach. Regardless of the brand, a level machine ensures optimal performance. It extends the lifespan of any washing machine. The basic principles of using a spirit level and adjusting feet remain constant across most models.

### Advanced Tips and Preventing Future Issues

Once your Speed Queen washing machine is perfectly level, consider a few extra steps. These tips help maintain its stability and prevent future problems. First, avoid placing anything heavy on top of the machine. This adds unnecessary weight and can affect its balance. Also, do not use the machine as a storage shelf.

Secondly, ensure the floor under the washing machine is solid. If you have an old, creaky floor, consider adding reinforcement. A concrete pad or a thick plywood base can provide a more stable foundation. This reduces vibrations significantly. A well-built foundation is crucial. It protects your machine from undue stress.

Thirdly, always distribute your laundry evenly inside the drum. This seems basic but is often overlooked. An unbalanced load is a primary cause of vibration, even on a perfectly level machine. Avoid washing one large, heavy item alone. Add smaller items to balance the load. This simple habit protects your machine's suspension system.

Lastly, periodically check the machine's level. I suggest doing this every six months. Just a quick check with the spirit level. It takes only a few minutes. This proactive approach saves you from loud, vibrating cycles. It extends the life of your Speed Queen. Regular maintenance is key to keeping your appliance in top condition. It gives you peace of mind.
