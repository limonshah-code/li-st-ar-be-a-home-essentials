## Step-by-Step Guide to Draining Your Heat Pump

Draining your Hayward pool heat pump is the most critical step in winterization. Any water left inside can freeze and cause significant damage. This process must be done thoroughly. I always double-check each part to ensure no water remains.

This section covers the exact steps to remove all water. You need to be patient and systematic. Rushing this part can lead to expensive repairs later. Pay close attention to each connection and drain point.

### Shutting Off Power and Water Supply

Before touching anything, ensure the heat pump is completely de-energized. This is a crucial safety step.

1.  **Turn off the power to the heat pump:** Locate the circuit breaker for your pool equipment. Flip the breaker to the "OFF" position. Some heat pumps also have a dedicated disconnect switch nearby. Turn this off too. Confirm that the unit is not receiving power. I always test it by trying to turn the heat pump on. It should not respond.
2.  **Turn off the water supply to the heat pump:** Find the bypass valves connected to your heat pump. These are typically ball valves that allow water to flow around or through the heat pump. Close the valves that direct water into and out of the heat pump. This isolates the unit from the rest of the pool plumbing. If your system does not have dedicated bypass valves, you may need to turn off the main pool pump and close other relevant valves in the system.

### Draining the Water Lines

Now, you can start removing the water from the heat pump itself.

1.  **Locate drain plugs:** Hayward heat pumps usually have one or more drain plugs. These are typically found on the bottom manifold or the lowest point of the plumbing inside the unit. Consult your specific Hayward heat pump manual for exact locations. Some models have simple threaded plugs, while others might have quick-disconnect fittings.
2.  **Open the drain plugs:** Place a bucket under the drain plug. Use an adjustable wrench or screwdriver to carefully open or remove each plug. Water will begin to flow out. Let all the water drain naturally. This might take a few minutes.
3.  **Disconnect plumbing unions:** If your heat pump has plumbing unions on the inlet and outlet lines, loosen these. This allows any trapped water in the lines leading to and from the heat pump to drain out. Sometimes, simply disconnecting these unions helps in draining without removing specific plugs.

I always find that gravity does most of the work here. Just be patient and let the water flow until it stops.

### Using Air for Thorough Drainage

While gravity helps, residual water can still remain. Using air ensures a complete drain.

1.  **Use a shop vacuum or air compressor:** Once the water flow slows or stops, connect your shop vacuum (set to "blow" mode) or an air compressor to one of the heat pump's water ports. I usually connect it to the inlet side.
2.  **Blow air through the unit:** Briefly blow air through the heat pump. You will see more water, usually a mix of water and air, exit the open drain plugs or the other port. Do this for 10-15 seconds at a time. Repeat this process for both the inlet and outlet ports. This forces any remaining water out of the coils and heat exchanger.
3.  **Confirm no water remains:** Listen for water sloshing or dripping. If you hear nothing, it means the unit is dry. I often tilt the unit slightly if possible to encourage any last drops to come out.
