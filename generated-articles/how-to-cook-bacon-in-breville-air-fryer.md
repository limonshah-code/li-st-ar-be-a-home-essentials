To cook bacon in your Breville air fryer, preheat the appliance to 375°F (190°C). Arrange bacon slices in a single layer in the air fryer basket or rack. Cook thin bacon for 8-10 minutes. Cook thick-cut bacon for 12-15 minutes. Flip the bacon halfway through cooking. This method creates perfectly crispy bacon with minimal mess.

## Why Air Fry Bacon in Your Breville? A Cleaner, Crispier Way

Cooking bacon in a Breville air fryer offers distinct advantages over traditional methods. My experience shows this method provides a cleaner, more efficient way to prepare delicious bacon. Many people still use a pan on the stovetop. This often leads to splattering grease and uneven cooking. The air fryer solves these problems.

First, it reduces mess significantly. The enclosed cooking environment keeps grease contained. You will not find grease splattered across your countertop or stovetop. This saves a lot of time on cleanup after breakfast. I always appreciate not having to scrub down my entire kitchen. Cleaning your Breville air fryer is also straightforward compared to a greasy pan. Knowing [how to clean the inside of your Breville air fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-inside-of-breville-air-fryer) makes the process even easier.

Second, air frying delivers superior crispiness. The Breville air fryer uses circulating hot air. This air cooks the bacon evenly from all sides. It renders the fat efficiently. This process creates a perfectly crisp texture. Each bite offers that satisfying crunch we all love. Unlike a skillet, where some parts might cook faster than others, the air fryer ensures consistent results.

Third, it often cooks faster than a conventional oven. An air fryer reaches its set temperature quickly. Its smaller cooking chamber heats up fast. This speeds up the cooking process for bacon. You can enjoy your meal sooner. This is a great benefit, especially on busy mornings. Overall, the Breville air fryer makes bacon cooking simple, clean, and delicious. You might even find that [cleaning your Breville air fryer is easy](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-the-breville-air-fryer-easy-to-clean) after cooking.

## Choosing the Right Bacon for Your Air Fryer

Selecting the correct type of bacon is an important step for air frying success. Not all bacon types perform equally in the air fryer. Your choice impacts cooking time and final crispiness. I have tried many varieties, and some work better than others.

Consider the thickness of your bacon slices. Regular-cut bacon works very well in the air fryer. It crisps up quickly and consistently. Thick-cut bacon takes a bit longer to cook. It also produces a chewier center with crispy edges. If you prefer a very crispy result throughout, stick with regular-cut. For a balance of chewiness and crisp, thick-cut is a good choice. I personally prefer regular-cut for its speed and consistent crispness.

Next, think about the cut itself. Streaky bacon, which has more fat, renders beautifully in the air fryer. The fat melts away, leaving crispy meat. Back bacon, or Canadian bacon, is leaner. It can dry out more quickly. If using back bacon, you may need to reduce cooking time. Keep a close eye on it to prevent overcooking.

Cured versus uncured bacon also plays a role. Most bacon sold in stores is cured. Uncured bacon lacks nitrates and nitrites. It might cook slightly differently. Always read the package labels. Regardless of the curing method, the air fryer handles both types well. Just adjust cooking times based on thickness and your desired crispness. The key is understanding how different bacon types react to the circulating hot air.

Finally, consider flavored bacon. Maple, peppered, or applewood smoked bacon add extra taste. These flavors intensify during air frying. Ensure any seasonings do not burn during cooking. Sometimes the sugar in maple bacon can caramelize quickly. This adds a lovely flavor but requires watchful cooking. Choose quality bacon from a trusted source for the best results.

## Essential Tools and Preparations for Air Frying Bacon

Before you begin cooking, gathering the right tools and preparing your Breville air fryer correctly is vital. These steps ensure a smooth cooking process and easy cleanup. You already have the main tool: your Breville air fryer. Whether it is a basket-style model or one of the larger Smart Oven Air models, the principles remain similar.

First, you need a pair of kitchen tongs. These are essential for safely placing bacon into the hot air fryer. Tongs also help you flip the bacon halfway through cooking. They allow you to remove the hot, crispy strips when done. Always use tongs to avoid touching the hot surfaces inside the air fryer.

Next, consider using parchment paper or aluminum foil. Many people ask, "Can you put foil in Breville air fryer?" The answer is often yes, but with precautions. You can line the bottom of your air fryer basket or tray with a small piece of [aluminum foil](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-aluminum-foil-in-breville-air-fryer-oven) or [parchment paper](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-parchment-paper-in-breville-air-fryer). This helps catch excess grease. It makes cleanup significantly easier. Ensure the paper or foil does not block air circulation. Do not let it touch the heating element. It should be just large enough to cover the area directly under the bacon. Never preheat the air fryer with an empty piece of parchment paper or foil inside. This can cause it to fly up and hit the heating element.

Always ensure your air fryer is clean before you start. A clean air fryer performs better and reduces the risk of smoke. Take a moment to wipe down any crumbs or grease from previous uses. This quick check helps maintain your appliance. It also prepares it for optimal bacon cooking. Proper preparation sets the stage for perfect results.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Cooking Bacon in Your Breville Air Fryer

Cooking bacon in your Breville air fryer is a straightforward process. Following these steps ensures consistently perfect, crispy results every time. I find this method produces the best bacon with minimal effort.

### Step 1: Preheat Your Breville Air Fryer

Begin by preheating your Breville air fryer. Set the temperature to 375°F (190°C). Most Breville models have a dedicated "Air Fry" function. If yours does, select that setting. Preheating is crucial for even cooking. It helps the bacon start crisping immediately when it enters the hot chamber. The time it takes for your [Breville air fryer to preheat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-does-breville-air-fryer-take-to-preheat) can vary. Generally, allow 3-5 minutes for it to reach the target temperature.

### Step 2: Prepare the Bacon

While the air fryer preheats, prepare your bacon. Pat the bacon slices dry with paper towels. This removes excess moisture. Removing moisture helps the bacon crisp up better. It also reduces splattering. Then, decide if you want to use a liner. As discussed, a small piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil can catch grease. Place it carefully at the bottom of the basket or on the tray. Ensure it does not cover too much surface area. It must not touch the heating element.

### Step 3: Arrange Bacon in a Single Layer

Carefully place the bacon slices into the air fryer basket or onto the rack. Arrange them in a single layer. Do not overcrowd the basket. Overlapping bacon will steam rather than crisp. This leads to chewy, undercooked spots. If you have a larger batch of bacon, cook it in batches. This ensures optimal air circulation around each slice. The Breville Smart Oven Air models often have larger capacities. This allows more bacon per batch. For specific instructions on [how to use your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer-pro), consult your appliance manual.

### Step 4: Cook the Bacon

Slide the basket or tray back into the air fryer. Cook the bacon for 8 to 15 minutes. The exact time depends on the bacon's thickness and your desired crispness.
*   **Regular-cut bacon:** Start with 8-10 minutes.
*   **Thick-cut bacon:** Start with 12-15 minutes.
Around the halfway point (after 4-7 minutes), open the air fryer. Use tongs to flip each bacon slice. This promotes even cooking and crisping on both sides.

### Step 5: Check Doneness and Remove

Monitor the bacon closely during the last few minutes. Air fryers cook quickly. Bacon can go from perfectly crisp to burnt in a short time. Look for a deep golden brown color and a firm, crispy texture. Once the bacon reaches your preferred level of crispness, carefully remove it from the air fryer using tongs. Place the cooked bacon on a plate lined with paper towels. This absorbs any remaining grease. Serve immediately and enjoy your perfectly air-fried bacon.

## Achieving Perfect Crispy Bacon: Tips and Tricks

Achieving truly perfect, crispy bacon in your Breville air fryer goes beyond the basic steps. Small adjustments and key practices make a significant difference. My goal is always that delightful crunch with every bite. These tips help you get there consistently.

First, **do not overcrowd the basket.** This is arguably the most critical tip. As mentioned earlier, air fryers work by circulating hot air. When you pile bacon slices on top of each other, the air cannot reach all surfaces. This results in steamed, limp bacon instead of crispy strips. I always cook bacon in batches. This ensures each piece has enough space for proper air circulation. It might take a few extra minutes overall. However, the quality of the bacon is worth it.

Second, **consider the bacon's initial temperature.** Starting with bacon that is not too cold can help with even cooking. I typically take bacon out of the fridge 5-10 minutes before placing it in the air fryer. This slight temperature adjustment prevents the bacon from seizing up too much when it hits the heat. This helps the fat render more smoothly.

Third, **monitor and adjust cooking time frequently.** Air fryers cook fast. Different brands and models of bacon can also cook differently. Your desired level of crispness also impacts cooking time. I recommend checking the bacon every minute or two during the last few minutes of cooking. This prevents overcooking. You can always add more time, but you cannot undo burnt bacon.

Fourth, **drain excess grease if necessary.** For very fatty bacon or thick-cut varieties, grease can accumulate in the bottom of the air fryer. This pooling grease can prevent the bottom of the bacon from crisping. It can also cause smoke. Carefully pull out the basket during cooking. Pour out any accumulated grease. Then, return the basket to continue cooking. Be careful, as the grease will be hot. This step often leads to a crispier finish and less smoke.

Finally, **pat the bacon dry before cooking.** This simple step helps immensely. Moisture on the bacon surface can lead to steaming. Patting it dry with paper towels ensures the bacon crisps up faster and more evenly. This also minimizes potential splattering inside the air fryer. These simple tricks elevate your air-fried bacon from good to outstanding.

## Handling Bacon Grease and Cleanup After Air Frying

Cooking bacon in your Breville air fryer reduces mess compared to a skillet. However, proper handling of bacon grease and subsequent cleanup is still essential. This ensures the longevity of your appliance and a clean kitchen. I have learned the best practices for managing this.

First, let's talk about **bacon grease disposal**. Never pour hot bacon grease down your kitchen drain. It can solidify in your pipes. This leads to costly clogs. Instead, let the grease cool down. Once it solidifies, scoop it into a disposable container. You can use an old tin can, a glass jar, or an empty milk carton. Then, throw the sealed container in the trash. Some people save bacon grease for cooking. If you do, pour the hot grease through a fine-mesh strainer into a heat-proof jar. Store it in your refrigerator. Learning [how to properly clean bacon grease](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bacon-grease) ensures your plumbing stays clear.

Second, for **Breville air fryer cleanup**, start once the appliance cools down. This prevents burns and allows any grease to congeal slightly. The basket or trays of many Breville air fryers are often non-stick. Some parts might even be dishwasher safe. However, always check your specific model's manual. For Breville Smart Oven models, cleaning the racks and drip tray is important. You can often clean the main basket or tray with warm, soapy water. Use a soft sponge or cloth. Avoid abrasive scrubbers. These can damage the non-stick coating.

For stubborn, baked-on grease, a paste of baking soda and water can work wonders. Apply the paste. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Then, gently scrub it away. Knowing [how to clean the inside of your Breville air fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-inside-of-breville-air-fryer) is key for regular maintenance. For those wondering if [Breville air fryer baskets can go in the dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-breville-air-fryer-basket-in-dishwasher), refer to your specific model's instructions.

Regular cleaning prevents grease buildup. This buildup can cause smoke during future cooking. It also impacts your air fryer's performance. A clean air fryer cooks more efficiently and lasts longer. Taking a few minutes to clean after each use saves a lot of trouble later.

## Troubleshooting Common Air Fryer Bacon Issues

Even with the best intentions, you might encounter a few hiccups when cooking bacon in your Breville air fryer. Don't worry, most issues have simple solutions. I have dealt with these concerns myself and can offer practical advice.

One common problem is **bacon not getting crispy enough**. This usually happens for a few reasons.
*   **Overcrowding:** If you put too many slices in the basket, air cannot circulate properly. The bacon ends up steaming. Always cook bacon in a single layer. Do it in batches if needed.
*   **Insufficient cooking time or temperature:** Your air fryer might need more time or a slightly higher temperature. Check that your Breville air fryer is fully preheated. Add 1-2 minutes to the cooking time.
*   **Too much moisture:** Patting bacon dry with paper towels before cooking removes excess moisture. This helps it crisp up.

Another frequent issue is **excessive smoking**. Bacon is fatty. Its fat can drip and burn if it accumulates or if the air fryer is dirty.
*   **Grease buildup:** Ensure your air fryer and its drip tray are clean before cooking. Old grease can smoke.
*   **Fat rendering:** For very fatty bacon, consider adding a small amount of water (about 1-2 tablespoons) to the bottom drip tray *under* the basket. This helps catch grease and prevent it from burning. Be careful not to add water directly to the heating elements.
*   **Drain grease:** If a lot of grease pools during cooking, carefully pull out the basket. Pour out the hot grease. Then, continue cooking.

Sometimes, **bacon cooks unevenly**. One side might be crispier than the other.
*   **Not flipping:** You must flip the bacon halfway through the cooking process. This ensures both sides get equal exposure to the circulating hot air.
*   **Uneven arrangement:** Make sure each slice lies flat in a single layer. Bacon that is folded or crinkled will cook unevenly.
*   **Hot spots:** While Breville air fryers generally cook evenly, slight variations can occur. Rotating the basket or tray halfway through can help if flipping isn't enough.

Finally, if your **air fryer seems to take a long time to cook** the bacon, consider if it is functioning correctly. Some large oven-style air fryers, like the Breville Smart Oven Air, might take slightly longer than compact basket models. This is due to their larger internal volume. If your Breville oven air fryer takes a while to cook, it might be due to its design. Read more on why [oven air fryers can take longer to cook](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-oven-air-fryer-take-so-long-to-cook). Always ensure your appliance is set to the correct function and temperature. These troubleshooting tips help resolve most common air frying bacon challenges.
