## Can I Put Toms In The Washing Machine Safely?

Do your beloved Toms shoes look a bit tired? Maybe they have dirt marks or just lost their fresh appeal. Many people wonder if they can simply toss their Toms into the washing machine for a quick clean. This question is common for any fabric shoe owner. It makes sense to want an easy cleaning method. I know I always look for simple ways to keep my favorite items clean.

This guide answers the question: "Can I put Toms in the washing machine?" It provides clear steps for cleaning them safely. We will cover the correct way to prepare your Toms, the best washing machine settings, and how to dry them without causing damage. You will also learn about materials that are not machine-washable and proper care tips. My goal is to help you keep your Toms looking good for a long time.

### Takeaway

*   **Most Canvas Toms are machine-washable:** Use a gentle cycle and cold water.
*   **Always pre-treat and protect:** Remove loose dirt, use a mesh bag.
*   **Air dry completely:** Avoid the dryer to prevent shrinking or damage.
*   **Suede and leather Toms need different care:** Do not machine wash these materials.

Toms shoes often become dirty from daily wear. You might want to wash them to restore their look. Yes, you can put Toms in the washing machine, but you must do it carefully. Only machine wash Toms made of canvas or other fabric materials. Always use a gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. Air drying is essential to prevent shrinking or damage.

## Understanding Toms Materials for Machine Washing

Toms shoes come in many materials. Not all of these materials are safe for machine washing. Knowing what your Toms are made from is the first step. This prevents damage during cleaning. I always check the material before deciding how to clean any item.

Most classic Toms are canvas. Canvas is a durable fabric. It handles water well. This makes canvas Toms good candidates for machine washing. They can withstand the gentle agitation of a washing machine. You will find that many Toms shoes are made with this strong fabric.

Other Toms may use different materials. Some Toms have linen or cotton blends. These fabrics are also often suitable for machine washing. They behave much like canvas when wet. Always check the shoe's tag if you are unsure. The tag gives care instructions.

However, some Toms are made from delicate materials. Suede Toms, leather Toms, or those with delicate embellishments should never go into a washing machine. Water can stain suede and leather. Machine washing can also ruin their texture. Embellishments can detach or break. For these types of Toms, hand cleaning or spot cleaning is the best method. Treat them with extra care to keep them looking new.

## Preparing Your Toms for the Washing Machine

Proper preparation makes a big difference. It helps protect your Toms and your washing machine. Taking a few minutes before the wash cycle prevents problems. I always prepare my items before washing them to ensure the best outcome.

First, remove any visible loose dirt. You can use a soft brush for this. A dry brush helps remove mud or dust. This stops dirt from spreading in the washing machine. It also helps the cleaning process work better.

Next, remove the insoles from your Toms. Many Toms have removable insoles. Washing insoles separately helps them dry better. It also prevents them from trapping dirt inside the shoe. You can usually hand wash insoles with a little soap and water.

Then, put your Toms in a mesh laundry bag. This step is very important. A mesh bag protects the shoes from harsh tumbling. It also prevents them from hitting the washing machine drum too hard. This reduces the risk of damage. It also keeps shoelaces from tangling around other clothes. Using a mesh bag is a simple but effective way to protect your shoes.

## The Gentle Cycle is Your Friend: Washing Machine Settings for Toms

Choosing the right washing machine settings is key. You want to clean your Toms without harming them. The wrong settings can lead to shrinking, fading, or damage. I make sure to use gentle settings for my delicate items.

Always use a gentle or delicate cycle. This setting uses less agitation. It mimics hand washing more closely. A gentle cycle protects the fabric and stitching of your Toms. It is designed for fragile items, so it is perfect for shoes. Many washing machines have this specific option.

Use cold water only. Hot water can cause canvas and other fabrics to shrink. It can also fade the colors of your Toms. Cold water cleans effectively without these risks. It is also energy-efficient. Cold water helps maintain the original shape and color of your shoes. This is a crucial step for shoe longevity.

Choose a mild detergent. Harsh detergents can be too strong for shoe fabrics. They might strip colors or leave residue. Liquid detergent is often better than powder. Powder detergents can sometimes clump and not dissolve fully. A small amount of mild liquid detergent is enough. Avoid using bleach, as it can damage and discolor the fabric.

## Drying Your Toms Safely: Air Dry is Key

Drying your Toms properly is just as important as washing them. Incorrect drying can cause shrinking, warping, or even mildew. The dryer is not a friend to your Toms shoes. I always air dry my shoes to keep them in good shape.

Never put your Toms in the dryer. The high heat from a dryer will shrink the canvas. It can also melt the glue that holds the shoe together. This can ruin the shape and fit of your shoes. Extreme heat also causes colors to fade quickly. Avoiding the dryer is the most important rule for drying Toms.

Air drying is the only safe method. After washing, gently reshape your Toms. You can stuff them lightly with paper towels or clean, white rags. This helps maintain their shape as they dry. Do not use newspaper, as the ink can transfer to the shoes. This simple step prevents your Toms from looking misshapen.

Place your Toms in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot with good air circulation. Direct sunlight can also cause fading, so avoid it. A shady spot outdoors or an indoor area with good airflow is ideal. Drying can take 24-48 hours. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to odor and mildew.

## Addressing Common Concerns: Shrinkage, Fading, and Damage Prevention

Many people worry about damaging their Toms during washing. These concerns are valid. Taking precautions helps ensure your shoes stay in good condition. I always think about potential problems before starting a task.

Shrinkage is a common fear with fabric shoes. Using cold water and avoiding the dryer greatly reduces this risk. Cold water does not cause fabric fibers to contract as much as hot water. Air drying prevents the rapid heat exposure that makes shoes shrink. If your Toms feel a bit snug after drying, they often stretch back to fit with a little wear.

Fading is another concern. Direct sunlight during drying causes colors to fade. Using a mild, color-safe detergent helps. Washing with cold water also preserves colors better. Avoid washing Toms too frequently. Frequent washing can cause colors to dull over time.

Preventing damage involves a few simple steps. Always use a mesh laundry bag. This protects the shoes from hitting the drum. It also prevents laces from tangling. Removing insoles and pre-brushing dirt also protects the shoes. These small steps add up to a much safer wash. Following these guidelines helps you maintain your Toms' appearance and extend their life.

## Alternative Cleaning Methods for Delicate Toms

While many Toms are machine-washable, some are not. For these delicate pairs, alternative cleaning methods are necessary. Hand washing and spot cleaning offer gentle solutions. I often use these methods for my more delicate items.

### Hand Washing Delicate Canvas Toms

Hand washing is a great option for canvas Toms if you prefer not to use a machine. It gives you more control over the process. You can gently scrub specific areas. This method is effective for light dirt and stains.

To hand wash, fill a basin with cool water. Add a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Submerge your Toms. Use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to gently scrub dirty areas. Focus on stains and soiled spots. Rinse the shoes thoroughly under cool running water. Make sure all soap residue is gone. Squeeze out excess water gently. Then, air dry them as described previously, stuffing them to hold their shape.

### Spot Cleaning for Suede, Leather, or Embellished Toms

Some Toms models feature suede, leather, or intricate embellishments. These materials should never be submerged in water or machine washed. Spot cleaning is the safest way to address dirt or stains on these shoes. This method targets only the affected area.

For suede Toms, use a suede brush to remove dry dirt. For tougher marks, a suede eraser can work. Always brush in one direction. If there is a wet stain, blot it immediately with a clean cloth. For leather Toms, wipe them with a damp cloth and mild soap. Then, wipe clean with a separate damp cloth. Apply a leather conditioner afterward. For embellished Toms, gently wipe around the embellishments with a damp cloth. Avoid getting water directly on delicate parts. Always test any cleaning product on a hidden area first. This ensures it does not cause discoloration.

## Maintaining Cleanliness: Tips for Long-Term Toms Care

Regular maintenance helps your Toms stay clean longer. It also reduces the need for frequent deep washes. Good habits can extend the life of your shoes. I find that prevention is always better than a cure.

**Store Your Toms Properly:** Store your Toms in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight. This helps prevent fading and material degradation. You can use shoe trees or stuff them with tissue paper. This helps them keep their shape when not in use. Proper storage prevents dust and dirt from accumulating.

**Address Stains Promptly:** If your Toms get a fresh stain, clean it immediately. Fresh stains are easier to remove. Blot liquid spills with a clean cloth. For mud, let it dry first, then brush it off. Quick action prevents stains from setting into the fabric.

**Use Protective Sprays:** Consider using a fabric protectant spray on your canvas Toms. These sprays create a barrier against water and stains. They can make future cleaning easier. Make sure the spray is suitable for canvas or fabric shoes. Apply it according to the product instructions. This adds an extra layer of defense against everyday grime.

**Rotate Your Shoes:** If you wear Toms often, have more than one pair. Rotating your shoes gives them time to air out. This reduces odor buildup. It also reduces wear and tear on a single pair. This simple practice helps prolong the life of all your footwear.

## FAQ Section

### Can I wash Toms with other clothes?
