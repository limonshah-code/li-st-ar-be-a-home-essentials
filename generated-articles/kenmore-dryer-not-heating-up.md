## Power Problems: Checking Your Kenmore Dryer's Electrical Supply

When your Kenmore dryer is not heating up, the first step is always to check its power supply. Many times, the problem is simpler than a broken part. This initial check can save you time and money. It is a quick diagnostic step.

Begin by looking at your home's circuit breaker panel. Dryers draw a lot of power. They often have dedicated circuit breakers. An electric dryer usually uses two breakers, typically 30 amps each, linked together. If one or both of these breakers trip, your dryer will not heat. Find the tripped breaker and flip it completely off, then back on.

Also, examine the power cord. Ensure it is fully plugged into the wall outlet. A loose connection can prevent proper heating. Check the cord for any visible damage. Frayed wires or burns indicate a hazard. You should replace a damaged power cord immediately.

The wall outlet itself might have issues. You can test it with a voltage tester if you have one. This confirms the outlet is supplying power correctly. Sometimes, an older outlet can fail. If other appliances also struggle in that outlet, the outlet might be the problem. Always prioritize safety when checking electrical components.

For gas Kenmore dryers, electricity is still vital for controls and the igniter. Even a gas dryer needs a 120-volt power supply. Ensure its standard wall plug is secure. A power issue might affect your electric dryer’s ability to heat. This is true even if the drum turns.

## The Heating Element: A Common Culprit in Kenmore Electric Dryers

The heating element is a critical component in electric Kenmore dryers. When your Kenmore dryer not heating up, this part is often the cause. It is essentially a large coil of wire. This coil generates heat as electricity flows through it. Over time, the coil can break.

A broken heating element cannot produce heat. Your dryer will run, but the air stays cold. Testing the heating element requires a multimeter. You will need to access the element, typically located at the back of the dryer. Always disconnect power to the dryer first. Remove the rear access panel to expose the element housing.

Visually inspect the element. Look for breaks, burnt spots, or deformities in the coil. Even if it looks fine, it could still be bad. Use your multimeter set to ohms (Ω). Touch the probes to the terminals of the heating element. A good element will show continuity, usually between 10 and 30 ohms. No reading or an infinite reading means the element is open.

Replacing a heating element is a common DIY repair. You will unclip the old element and connect the new one. Ensure all wires are secure. Many Kenmore dryer models use similar heating elements. Finding the right part number is crucial. This step is a common fix for a non-heating electric dryer.

## Thermal Fuse and Thermistor: Kenmore Dryer's Safety Mechanisms

Your Kenmore dryer has built-in safety features. These protect the appliance from overheating. The thermal fuse and thermistor are two key components. When your Kenmore dryer not heating up, these parts often play a role. They can cut off the heat supply.

The **thermal fuse** is a one-time safety device. It is designed to blow if the dryer overheats significantly. This happens typically due to restricted airflow, like a clogged vent. Once the thermal fuse blows, it permanently breaks the electrical circuit. Your dryer will then stop heating entirely. Some models may even stop running altogether.

To test the thermal fuse, you need a multimeter. Disconnect power to the dryer. Access the thermal fuse, usually near the blower housing or heating element. Remove the wires from the fuse. Place your multimeter probes on the fuse terminals. A good fuse will show continuity (a low ohm reading). An open circuit (no reading) means the fuse is blown. A blown thermal fuse must be replaced. Always investigate the cause of overheating before replacing it.

The **thermistor** is a reusable temperature sensor. It constantly monitors the dryer's internal temperature. It sends signals to the control board. If the thermistor senses incorrect temperatures, it can tell the control board to cut off the heat. Unlike the thermal fuse, a thermistor usually does not blow permanently. It can become inaccurate or fail electrically.

Test the thermistor with a multimeter for resistance. Its resistance changes with temperature. Consult your dryer's service manual for specific resistance values at room temperature. A thermistor that reads outside the specified range is faulty. Replacing either of these parts can restore your dryer's heating function. Knowing [how to reset your Kenmore electric dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-kenmore-electric-dryer) often involves checking these safety components.

## Clogged Vents: Why Your Kenmore Dryer Overheats and Stops Heating

A clogged dryer vent system is a very common reason for a Kenmore dryer not heating up. Many people overlook this crucial aspect of dryer maintenance. Lint buildup restricts airflow dramatically. This restriction causes several problems.

First, poor airflow prevents moisture from escaping efficiently. Your clothes take much longer to dry. The dryer's internal temperature also rises excessively. This overheating triggers safety mechanisms. The thermal fuse, which we discussed earlier, will blow. This cuts off the heating element. The dryer will then run but produce no heat.

To check your vent, start with the lint screen. Pull it out and clean it thoroughly after every load. Even a partially blocked screen reduces airflow. Next, inspect the vent hose connected to the back of your dryer. Disconnect it from the dryer and the wall. Look for large clumps of lint. Clean out any blockages you find. A good flexible brush can help reach deep inside the hose.

Also, examine the outdoor vent hood. Lint can accumulate there, creating a flap that gets stuck closed. Make sure the flap opens freely when the dryer runs. If you have rigid ductwork, cleaning it requires more effort. You might need a professional vent cleaning service. Regular vent cleaning improves drying efficiency. It also prevents fire hazards. Addressing vent issues often solves the "no heat" problem. A clear vent lets your dryer operate safely and effectively.

## Gas Dryer Specifics: Flame Sensor, Igniter, and Gas Valve Issues

If you own a Kenmore gas dryer and it's not heating up, the problem involves different components. Electric dryers use a heating element. Gas dryers use a gas burner assembly to produce heat. These parts require careful attention.

The **igniter** is a crucial component in a gas dryer. When the dryer starts a heat cycle, the igniter glows red hot. Its purpose is to ignite the gas flowing from the burner. If the igniter is faulty, it will not glow. The gas will not ignite, and your dryer will stay cold. You can often see the igniter glow through a small peephole. If you see no glow, the igniter is likely bad.

The **flame sensor** works in conjunction with the igniter. It detects if the gas has successfully ignited. If the sensor does not detect a flame, it tells the gas valve to shut off. This prevents unburnt gas from accumulating. A faulty flame sensor can keep the gas valve closed. The dryer will not heat even if the igniter works. Testing involves checking for continuity with a multimeter.

The **gas valve** itself controls the flow of gas to the burner. It has coils that open the valve. If these coils are defective, the gas valve will not open. No gas means no flame. The igniter might glow, but no heat occurs. You can test gas valve coils for continuity. Replacing a gas valve or its coils is a more complex repair. It often requires specific tools and knowledge.

Always ensure the gas supply to your home is on. Check the gas shut-off valve behind the dryer. Make sure it is in the open position. Dealing with gas components carries inherent risks. If you are unsure about testing or replacing these parts, call a qualified appliance technician. Safety is always paramount when working with gas.

## Advanced Checks: Timer, Control Board, and Other Electrical Components

When simpler solutions fail, your Kenmore dryer not heating up might stem from more complex electrical issues. These problems often involve the main control system. Components like the timer, thermistor, and the main control board communicate to manage heating. Diagnosing these requires more technical skill.

The **timer** in older mechanical Kenmore dryers controls cycles and heat. If the timer's internal contacts for the heating circuit fail, it won't signal the heating element to turn on. Your dryer will still tumble, but no heat appears. Testing a timer can be difficult. It often involves checking multiple continuity points. A faulty timer usually needs replacement.

Modern Kenmore dryers use an electronic **control board**. This board acts as the dryer's brain. It receives input from sensors like the thermistor. It then sends commands to components like the heating element or gas valve. A defective control board can fail to send the "heat on" signal. You might see error codes on the display. Visual inspection for burnt spots or damaged components on the board is a first step. However, testing requires advanced diagnostic procedures. Replacing a control board can be costly.

Other less common electrical components can also fail. The **high-limit thermostat** is another safety device. Similar to a thermal fuse, it cuts power if temperatures get too high. Unlike the fuse, it typically resets once it cools down. If it fails to reset or sticks in the open position, the dryer will not heat. You can test it for continuity with a multimeter.

The **cycling thermostat** regulates the temperature during the drying cycle. If it malfunctions, it might incorrectly tell the heating element to shut off. It might even cause the element to not turn on at all. This part is also tested with a multimeter for continuity. These advanced checks involve more intricate wiring and system understanding. If you are not comfortable with these steps, consider professional help.
