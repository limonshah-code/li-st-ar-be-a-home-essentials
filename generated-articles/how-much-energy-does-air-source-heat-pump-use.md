A typical air source heat pump uses significantly less energy than traditional heating systems. This is because it transfers heat instead of creating it. Energy use varies greatly. Factors include home size, insulation, local climate, and the specific system's efficiency. Despite these variables, ASHPs generally offer substantial savings on running costs compared to fossil fuel boilers.

## Air Source Heat Pump Energy Consumption Basics

An air source heat pump (ASHP) moves heat from the outside air into your home. It does not burn fuel. This makes it a very efficient way to heat. The heat pump uses electricity to run a compressor. This compressor moves a refrigerant through a coil. This process absorbs heat from the air. It then releases this heat inside your house.

Imagine using a small amount of electricity to move a lot of heat. This is how an ASHP works. It can transfer more energy than it consumes. This efficiency is measured by something called the Coefficient of Performance (COP). A COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat for every 1 unit of electricity it uses. This is much better than an electric resistance heater, which has a COP of 1.

Traditional heating systems, like gas boilers, burn fuel directly. This creates heat. Electric furnaces turn electricity directly into heat. They are not very efficient. Air source heat pumps move existing heat. This design uses energy more smartly. It helps you reduce your energy bills.

## Calculating Typical Air Source Heat Pump Running Costs

Understanding the real cost of running an air source heat pump involves some math. We can estimate annual energy use. Then, we multiply that by your electricity rate. This gives you a clear picture. The main figure to consider is the Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF). This is like an average COP over an entire heating season. It takes into account varied outdoor temperatures.

Let's do a simple example. Suppose your home needs 10,000 kWh of heat per year. If your air source heat pump has an SPF of 3.5, it means it delivers 3.5 units of heat for every 1 unit of electricity used. So, your electricity consumption would be 10,000 kWh / 3.5 = 2,857 kWh per year. If electricity costs £0.25 per kWh, your annual running cost for heating would be 2,857 kWh * £0.25/kWh = £714.25. This shows how energy efficient the system is.

Compare this to a gas boiler with 80% efficiency. To get 10,000 kWh of heat, you would need 10,000 kWh / 0.80 = 12,500 kWh of gas. If gas costs £0.07 per kWh, the annual cost would be 12,500 kWh * £0.07/kWh = £875. Even with this simple example, you can see the potential savings.

These calculations are estimates. Your actual costs depend on your energy tariff. They also depend on how you use your system. The climate where you live also matters. A professional installer can give you a more accurate estimate. They will consider your specific property. While we discuss running costs, it is useful to consider [how much does air source heat pump cost to install](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-does-air-source-heat-pump-cost-to-install) as well.
