## How To Use Sodium Percarbonate To Clean Washing Machine

Is your washing machine looking a bit dingy, or worse, does it smell unpleasant? You are not alone. Washing machines, designed to clean clothes, can themselves accumulate grime, detergent residue, mold, and odors over time. This buildup can affect how well your clothes get clean and shorten your machine's lifespan. Fortunately, there is a powerful yet eco-friendly solution: **sodium percarbonate**.

Using sodium percarbonate to clean your washing machine offers an effective way to restore its freshness and performance. This guide will walk you through a simple, step-by-step process. We will explore what makes sodium percarbonate an excellent cleaner for your appliance. You will learn how to use it safely and efficiently for a deep clean. Get ready to give your washing machine the refresh it needs.

### Takeaway:
*   Sodium percarbonate is an effective, eco-friendly cleaner for washing machines.
*   It breaks down into oxygen and soda ash, tackling mold, odors, and residue.
*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup and keeps your machine working well.
*   Follow simple steps for a deep clean and ongoing maintenance.

To use sodium percarbonate to clean your washing machine, add about ½ cup to 1 cup of the powder directly into the washing machine drum. Set the machine to its hottest water setting and the longest cycle, allowing it to agitate for a few minutes before pausing for a soak. After soaking, complete the cycle, then wipe down all surfaces.

### Understanding Sodium Percarbonate: Your Eco-Friendly Cleaning Ally

Sodium percarbonate is a versatile compound, often called "oxygen bleach." It combines hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate, also known as soda ash. This powerful combination makes it an excellent choice for many cleaning tasks, especially for your washing machine. When sodium percarbonate dissolves in water, it releases oxygen and soda ash. These components work together to lift stains, remove odors, and break down grime.

I find it incredibly useful because it is a greener alternative to traditional chlorine bleach. It does not contain chlorine, phosphates, or other harsh chemicals. This makes it safer for septic systems and the environment. Its effectiveness comes from the oxygen bubbles it produces. These bubbles work to break apart dirt, mold, and bacteria. This action leaves surfaces clean and sanitized.

#### Why Choose Sodium Percarbonate for Appliance Cleaning?

Choosing sodium percarbonate for cleaning your washing machine brings many benefits. First, it is a potent deodorizer. It neutralizes unpleasant smells caused by mold and mildew effectively. Second, its oxidizing properties make it great at tackling stubborn stains and residue inside the drum. This includes detergent buildup and fabric softener sludge.

Third, it is gentler on your machine's components compared to harsh chemicals. This helps prolong the life of your appliance. Fourth, it is color-safe, so you do not need to worry about accidental bleaching if some powder residue remains. Finally, it helps keep your machine free from bacteria and mold. This ensures your clothes come out truly clean.

### Gathering Your Tools: What You Need for a Deep Clean

Before you begin cleaning your washing machine with sodium percarbonate, gather all your supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and efficient. You do not need many items, but the right tools ensure a thorough clean. This preparation step is simple but important for good results. Make sure your area is well-lit and you have space to work.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Sodium Percarbonate:** This is your primary cleaning agent. You can usually find it in the laundry aisle or online. Look for products labeled "oxygen bleach" or "sodium percarbonate."
*   **Warm Water:** You will need warm water for mixing solutions and for the machine's cleaning cycle. Hot water activates sodium percarbonate best.
*   **Microfiber Cloths or Sponges:** These are for wiping down surfaces, gaskets, and dispensers. Have a few on hand.
*   **Spray Bottle (Optional):** This is useful for pre-mixing a solution to target specific areas like the detergent dispenser or door seals.
*   **Old Toothbrush or Small Brush (Optional):** This can help scrub tight spots like the detergent dispenser or door seals.
*   **Gloves:** Wearing gloves protects your hands from irritation. Sodium percarbonate is not as harsh as chlorine bleach, but skin sensitivity can vary.

Always read the instructions on your sodium percarbonate product label. Different brands may have slightly different concentrations or recommendations. Ensure you have proper ventilation in your laundry area. Open a window or turn on an exhaust fan. This helps air circulation and removes any lingering odors. This small preparation makes your cleaning task much easier and safer.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Cleaning Your Washing Machine with Sodium Percarbonate

Cleaning your washing machine with sodium percarbonate is a straightforward process. Following these steps ensures you achieve a thorough and effective clean. I always find that a systematic approach works best for appliance maintenance. This method tackles both the drum and external parts, leaving your machine sparkling.

#### Preparing Your Machine

First, make sure your washing machine is completely empty. Remove any clothes or items from the drum. Then, wipe down the visible surfaces of the drum with a damp cloth. This removes any loose lint, hair, or debris. A clean starting point helps the sodium percarbonate work more efficiently.

#### The Percarbonate Solution

For a standard washing machine, add about ½ cup to 1 cup of sodium percarbonate directly into the empty drum. For very dirty machines, you can use slightly more. Avoid putting it in the detergent dispenser for the main drum clean. It works best when dissolved directly in the water inside the drum.

#### Running the Cleaning Cycle

Set your washing machine to the hottest water setting available. Choose the largest load size setting. Select the longest wash cycle, such as a "heavy duty" or "sanitize" cycle if your machine has one. Start the cycle. Let the machine agitate for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the sodium percarbonate to dissolve fully and mix with the water.

After agitation, pause or stop the cycle. Allow the solution to soak in the drum for at least 1-2 hours. For very dirty or smelly machines, you can let it soak for up to 4 hours or even overnight. This soaking time is critical. It allows the oxygen bubbles to break down mold, mildew, and residue effectively. After the soak, resume the cycle and let it complete fully. This drains the dirty water and rinses the drum.

#### Cleaning Gaskets, Dispenser, and Exterior

While the machine is soaking or after the main cycle finishes, clean the other parts. Mix a small amount of sodium percarbonate with warm water in a spray bottle or bowl. Use about 1 tablespoon per cup of water. Spray or dip a cloth into this solution. Wipe down the rubber gasket around the door opening (front-loader) or the top rim (top-loader). Pay close attention to any visible mold or grime. You can use an old toothbrush for hard-to-reach areas.

Remove the detergent and fabric softener dispensers if possible. Soak them in the percarbonate solution for 30 minutes. Scrub them clean with a brush. If they are not removable, wipe them thoroughly with the solution-soaked cloth. Finally, wipe down the exterior of your washing machine. This includes the control panel and lid/door. Use a clean, damp cloth for this. A clean exterior contributes to the overall fresh look and feel. To fully clean your appliance, remember to check resources like [how to clean your washing machine inside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-washing machine-inside) to address all interior components beyond the drum.

#### Final Rinse and Wipe Down

After the cleaning cycle and manual wiping, run a short rinse cycle with plain water. This ensures all residue from the sodium percarbonate is gone. Once this cycle finishes, use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum. Leave the washing machine door or lid open for several hours. This allows the interior to air dry completely. Air drying prevents new mold or mildew from forming. Your washing machine should now look and smell fresh.

### Targeting Common Issues: Mold, Odors, and Residue

Sodium percarbonate is exceptionally effective at tackling the most common washing machine problems. These include stubborn mold, lingering odors, and sticky residue. I have found it performs far better than many general cleaners for these specific issues. Its active oxygen release provides a deep cleaning action that reaches where basic wiping cannot.

For mold growth, especially in rubber gaskets or detergent dispensers, sodium percarbonate is a powerful ally. Mold thrives in damp, dark environments, making washing machine seals a prime spot. The oxygen released from percarbonate acts as a natural fungicide. It breaks down the mold structure and helps lift it away. I recommend applying a stronger solution directly to molded areas. Let it sit for a good 30 minutes before scrubbing. For more detailed mold removal, consider guides like [how to clean mold from washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing-machine).

Unpleasant odors in your washing machine often come from mildew, bacteria, and stagnant water. These smells can transfer to your clean laundry. Sodium percarbonate neutralizes these odor-causing agents. When used in a hot water cycle with a long soak, it sanitizes the drum. This leaves a truly fresh scent, not just a masked one. If your machine has a persistent smell, a dedicated clean with sodium percarbonate can often resolve it. For additional tips on persistent smells, you might find useful information in resources such as [how to clean a smelly washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-a-smelly-washing-machine).

Detergent and fabric softener residue can build up inside your machine's drum and hoses. This sticky film can trap dirt and become a breeding ground for bacteria. Sodium percarbonate's fizzing action helps loosen and dissolve this residue. The soda ash component also aids in breaking down grease and grime. This leaves the drum and internal components cleaner. Regular use helps prevent these issues from accumulating, keeping your machine running at its best.

### Maintaining a Clean Washing Machine: Beyond the Deep Clean

A deep clean with sodium percarbonate is a great start. However, maintaining a clean washing machine requires ongoing effort. I always tell people that prevention is easier than cure when it comes to appliance care. Simple habits can prevent mold, odor, and residue buildup between major cleaning sessions. These practices ensure your machine stays fresh and effective for a longer time.

One crucial step is to clean your washing machine filter regularly. Lint, coins, and small items can get trapped here. A clogged filter affects drainage and can cause unpleasant smells. Refer to a guide on [how to clean washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter) for specific instructions. This task is often overlooked but plays a big role in machine performance.

After each wash cycle, leave the washing machine door or lid ajar. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. Proper air circulation helps the interior dry completely. This simple action prevents moisture buildup, which is the primary cause of mold and mildew growth. I do this every single time I finish laundry, and it makes a huge difference.

Wipe down the rubber gasket (for front-loaders) or the top rim (for top-loaders) after your last load of the day. Use a damp cloth to remove any standing water, lint, or small debris. This prevents moisture from lingering in these areas. You can also wipe the detergent dispenser drawer. This removes any sticky residue that can accumulate there.

Use the right amount of detergent. Many people use too much detergent, especially with high-efficiency (HE) machines. Excess detergent creates more suds and residue. This residue can build up inside the machine and cause odors. Follow the detergent manufacturer's recommendations. Use HE detergent for HE machines. Consider running a quick hot water rinse cycle once a month with just water to flush out minor buildup. Incorporating these simple habits into your laundry routine will keep your washing machine in top condition. This also extends the benefits of your sodium percarbonate deep clean.

### Sodium Percarbonate vs. Other Cleaners: A Comparison

When it comes to cleaning washing machines, sodium percarbonate is not the only option. However, it offers distinct advantages over common alternatives like vinegar and bleach. I have tried many methods over the years. I find sodium percarbonate provides a unique balance of effectiveness and environmental consideration.

Vinegar is a popular natural cleaner. It is acidic, which helps dissolve mineral deposits and some soap scum. It also has deodorizing properties. Many people use white vinegar for light cleaning and maintenance. It is safe for most machines and very affordable. However, vinegar is not as potent at killing mold spores or breaking down heavy residue as oxygen bleach. Its odor can also linger for a short time after cleaning. For a detailed look at using vinegar, you can check out [how to clean washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-vinegar).

Chlorine bleach is a powerful disinfectant. It effectively kills bacteria and mold. It also removes tough stains. It can sanitize a washing machine very well. However, chlorine bleach is a harsh chemical. Its fumes can be strong and irritating. It can also damage rubber seals over time if used too frequently or in high concentrations. Mixing bleach with other cleaners, especially acids like vinegar, can create dangerous fumes. This makes it less desirable for regular machine cleaning. You can learn more about using bleach in this article: [how to clean washing machine with bleach](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-bleach).

Sodium percarbonate strikes a balance. It provides the sanitizing power of oxygen bleach without the harshness of chlorine bleach. It breaks down into oxygen and soda ash, both harmless to the environment and your machine. It effectively tackles mold, odors, and residue, often outperforming vinegar in these areas. It is also safer to handle than chlorine bleach. For these reasons, sodium percarbonate is my preferred choice for deep cleaning. It leaves the washing machine truly clean, fresh, and free from harsh chemical residues. It is a smart choice for both effectiveness and safety.
