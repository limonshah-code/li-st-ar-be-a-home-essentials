## Can Converse Shoes Go in the Washing Machine? Your Guide

Your trusty Converse shoes are a staple. They go with everything. They also get dirty quickly from all your adventures. You might stare at them, wondering if a washing machine can restore their fresh look. I understand this common question. It is important to clean them well without causing damage. This article explains how to safely wash your Converse shoes in the washing machine. We will cover preparation, the washing process, and drying. You will learn the best methods to keep your sneakers looking new.

### Takeaway

*   **Prepare Carefully:** Remove laces and insoles. Brush off loose dirt.
*   **Protect Your Shoes:** Place Converse in a mesh laundry bag with towels.
*   **Choose Right Settings:** Use cold water, a gentle cycle, and mild detergent.
*   **Avoid Heat:** Never use a machine dryer. Air dry naturally.
*   **Check Material:** Canvas Converse wash well; leather types need different care.
*   **Hand Wash Options:** Consider hand washing for delicate or leather styles.

Yes, you can generally put most canvas Converse shoes in the washing machine. Always remove laces and insoles first. Use a mesh laundry bag, cold water, and a gentle cycle with mild detergent. Air drying is essential to prevent damage. This method helps restore their cleanliness effectively.

## Understanding Your Converse: Materials and Their Needs

Before washing any shoe, you must know its material. Converse shoes come in different styles. The most common type is canvas. Canvas is a durable, woven cotton fabric. This material responds well to machine washing.

Some Converse models use leather or suede. These materials require different cleaning methods. Putting leather or suede shoes in a washing machine can cause damage. The water and agitation can crack the material or fade its color. Always check the shoe's tag or product information for specific care instructions.

For canvas Converse, machine washing is a good option. It cleans deep-seated dirt and stains. However, proper preparation is key. I have found that skipping this step leads to less effective cleaning. We want clean shoes, not damaged ones.

## The Right Way to Prepare Converse for Machine Washing

Proper preparation is vital for successful machine washing. It protects your shoes and your washing machine. I always follow a few key steps before loading my Converse. This preparation makes a big difference in the outcome.

First, remove the shoelaces. Laces can tangle during the wash cycle. They can also get caught in the machine's agitator. You can wash laces separately by hand or in a small mesh bag. I often wash them with the shoes in the same bag.

Next, remove the insoles if they are removable. Insoles can shrink or lose their shape in the wash. Many insoles are made of foam or a similar material. It is better to hand wash insoles or simply air them out. This step prevents potential damage to the shoe's internal structure.

Finally, brush off any loose dirt or mud. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush. This pre-cleaning step helps prevent dirt from spreading. It also makes the machine wash more effective. If you have stubborn mud, let it dry first. Then, you can easily brush it away. Preparing your shoes helps avoid overloading the washing machine with grime.

## Choosing the Best Washing Machine Settings for Converse

Selecting the correct washing machine settings is crucial. Wrong settings can damage your shoes. I always opt for gentle options. This ensures my Converse stay in good shape.

Always use cold water. Hot water can cause canvas to shrink. It can also fade the colors of your shoes. Cold water protects the fabric and the adhesive holding the shoes together. It is a safer choice for shoe cleaning.

Set your washing machine to a gentle cycle. This cycle uses less agitation. It prevents shoes from being thrown around violently. Options like "delicate," "hand wash," or "gentle" are ideal. A robust cycle can loosen shoe components or distort their shape. My goal is always to clean, not to destroy.

Use a mild detergent. Harsh chemicals can strip color or damage fabric. Look for a liquid detergent designed for delicate items. Avoid powdered detergents, as they can sometimes leave residue. I use a small amount, usually half of what I would use for a regular load of clothes. Using too much detergent creates excessive suds. This is not good for your shoes or your machine.

## Protecting Your Converse and Washing Machine During the Wash

Protecting both your shoes and your washing machine is important. Shoes can be noisy and damaging if not secured. I have learned a few tricks to keep everything safe.

Place your Converse shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag acts as a protective barrier. It prevents shoes from clanking against the machine drum. It also keeps shoelaces from getting tangled. You can find these bags in most laundry sections. Using a mesh bag is a simple but effective step. [It's a smart way to ensure your sneakers are protected during the wash cycle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-converse-sneakers-be-machine-washed).

Add a few old towels to the wash with your shoes. The towels provide cushioning. They absorb some of the impact and noise. This prevents shoes from banging against the machine walls. The towels also help balance the load. This is especially helpful if you are washing only one pair of shoes. Make sure the towels are old ones. Dye from new towels could transfer to your shoes.

Avoid washing too many pairs of shoes at once. One or two pairs is usually enough. Overloading the machine can reduce cleaning effectiveness. It can also put extra strain on your washing machine. I always prioritize protecting my appliance and my shoes. This small step protects both my investment in footwear and my washing machine.

## How to Clean Different Types of Converse Materials

While canvas Converse are generally machine-washable, other materials require a different approach. Knowing the specific needs of your shoe's material is key. This prevents damage and ensures a thorough clean.

### Cleaning Canvas Converse (Machine Wash Method)

Most Converse are made of canvas. These are the easiest to clean in a washing machine. After removing laces and brushing off dirt, follow these steps:

1.  **Bag Them:** Place your canvas Converse in a mesh laundry bag.
2.  **Add Towels:** Toss a few old towels into the washing machine for padding.
3.  **Detergent:** Add a small amount of mild liquid detergent.
4.  **Settings:** Select a gentle cycle with cold water.
5.  **Wash:** Run the cycle.
6.  **Air Dry:** Remove immediately and air dry. Do not use a dryer.

For [how to clean white Converse shoes specifically, you might use an oxygen-based cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-converse-shoes) during this process. This helps lift stains and brighten the fabric without harsh bleaching.

### Cleaning Leather Converse (Hand Wash Only)

Leather Converse should never go into a washing machine. Water and agitation can cause the leather to crack, shrink, or become stiff. Machine washing also removes natural oils from the leather. This reduces its lifespan.

For leather Converse, I recommend hand cleaning:

*   **Wipe:** Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe down the surface.
*   **Mild Soap:** Apply a small amount of mild soap, like saddle soap, to the cloth.
*   **Clean:** Gently rub the leather in small circles.
*   **Rinse:** Wipe off soap residue with a clean, damp cloth.
*   **Condition:** Apply a leather conditioner to keep the material supple.
*   **Air Dry:** Let them air dry away from direct heat.

This method preserves the quality and appearance of your leather shoes. [Find more detailed guidance on how to clean leather Converse](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leather-converse) safely.

### Cleaning Suede Converse (Spot Clean Only)

Suede is a delicate material. It is easily damaged by water and harsh scrubbing. Machine washing is a definite no-go for suede Converse. Even excessive hand washing can ruin suede.

For suede shoes, focus on spot cleaning:

*   **Brush:** Use a dedicated suede brush to remove loose dirt and scuff marks. Brush in one direction.
*   **Eraser:** For stubborn marks, use a suede eraser. Gently rub the affected area.
*   **Suede Cleaner:** If needed, use a specific suede cleaner spray. Follow product instructions carefully.
*   **Protect:** Apply a suede protector spray regularly to repel water and stains.

Always treat suede with care. My experience shows that gentle attention prevents lasting damage.

## Drying Your Converse: The Most Important Step After Washing

Drying your Converse correctly is just as important as washing them. Incorrect drying can ruin your shoes. I always emphasize air drying. This method prevents damage and preserves shoe shape.

Never put your Converse shoes in a machine dryer. High heat is the enemy of shoes. It can melt adhesives, shrink canvas, or warp rubber soles. The heat can also cause the rubber to become brittle. This leads to cracking over time. Tumble drying also creates loud noise and potential damage to the machine. [You should always avoid drying shoes in a washing machine with a drying function or a separate dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-dry-shoes-in-washing-machine).

The best way to dry Converse is to air dry them. After removing them from the washing machine, reshape them slightly. You can stuff the toes with paper towels or clean rags. This helps maintain their original shape as they dry. Newspaper can be used, but be aware that ink might transfer.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. Direct sunlight is good for accelerating drying. However, extreme direct sunlight for extended periods might fade colors. A shaded, breezy spot is often ideal. Turn them periodically to ensure even drying. Drying usually takes 24-48 hours. Make sure they are completely dry before wearing them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to odor and mildew. [This is a key step to prevent smelly shoes after washing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-smelly-shoes-in-washing-machine).

## When to Hand Wash Converse Shoes Instead

Machine washing works well for canvas Converse. However, sometimes hand washing is a better choice. I consider hand washing for specific situations. This method offers more control.

Hand washing is ideal for delicate Converse. If your shoes have embellishments, hand washing is safer. Beads, sequins, or delicate stitching can get damaged in a machine. Hand washing protects these details. It ensures the longevity of your unique shoes.

It is also best for stubborn stains. A washing machine might not remove all tough marks. With hand washing, you can target specific areas. You can apply more pressure to remove ground-in dirt. I use an old toothbrush and a stain remover for these spots. [This is similar to how you would approach cleaning converse shoes rubber soles](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-converse-shoes-rubber) which often have tough scuff marks.

Furthermore, hand washing is excellent for quick cleans. If only a small part of your shoe is dirty, a full machine wash is unnecessary. You can spot clean the affected area quickly. This saves water and time. For instance, if only the toe cap needs a scrub, hand washing is my go-to.

## Troubleshooting Common Converse Washing Issues

Even with the best intentions, issues can arise when washing Converse. I've encountered a few common problems myself. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps maintain your shoes.

### Yellowing After Washing

Sometimes, white Converse can develop a yellow tint after washing. This often happens if detergent residue is left on the fabric. It can also occur if shoes are dried in direct, intense sunlight with residual moisture.

To fix this:
*   **Rinse Again:** Rinse the shoes thoroughly by hand under cold water. Make sure all soap is gone.
*   **White Vinegar:** Soak shoes in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water for 30 minutes. Rinse well.
*   **Sunlight (Controlled):** Dry shoes in sunlight, but turn them often. Ensure they dry completely and evenly.
*   **Oxygen Bleach:** For canvas, use a non-chlorine, oxygen-based bleach if the yellowing persists. Follow product instructions carefully.

### Retaining Shoe Shape

Some shoes might lose their original shape after a machine wash. This is common if they are not padded well or if the cycle is too aggressive.

To prevent this:
*   **Mesh Bag:** Always use a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Towels:** Wash with old towels for cushioning.
*   **Stuffing:** Immediately after washing, stuff shoes with paper towels or clean rags. This helps them hold their shape as they dry.
*   **Air Dry Flat:** Dry them on a flat surface or hung up by the laces, not on their side.

### Dealing with Lingering Odor

Sometimes, shoes still smell after washing. This can happen if they are not dried completely. Mildew can also form if moisture remains.

To combat odor:
*   **Ensure Complete Dryness:** Make sure shoes are completely dry before wearing or storing. Use a fan to speed up drying.
*   **Baking Soda:** Sprinkle baking soda inside dry shoes. Let it sit overnight, then shake it out.
*   **Odor Eliminators:** Use shoe deodorizing inserts or sprays.
*   **Sunlight:** The sun's UV rays can kill odor-causing bacteria. Place dry shoes in sunlight for a few hours.

By addressing these common issues, you can keep your Converse looking and smelling fresh.
