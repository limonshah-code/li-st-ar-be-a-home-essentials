### Clear, Concise Answer

Your electric oven likely stopped working due to a power supply interruption, a tripped circuit breaker, or a faulty internal component. Common culprits include a blown thermal fuse, a failed heating element, a malfunctioning temperature sensor, or a defective control board. Simple checks can often reveal the cause.

## Power Supply Problems: The First Check

When your electric oven just stops working, the very first thing to check is its power supply. This step seems obvious, but it often solves the problem immediately. An oven needs a steady flow of electricity to function. Without it, the unit remains completely dead.

Start by looking at your home's circuit breaker box. Ovens usually have a dedicated 240-volt circuit. Find the breaker switch labeled for your kitchen or oven. If the switch is in the "off" position or halfway between "on" and "off," it has tripped. Simply flip it firmly to the "off" position first, then back to "on." This resets the circuit. If the breaker trips again immediately, a more serious electrical issue exists within the oven or its wiring. You should not ignore a repeatedly tripping breaker.

Next, check the oven's power cord and wall outlet. Ensure the cord is fully plugged into the outlet. Sometimes, a loose connection can interrupt power. Visually inspect the cord for any signs of damage, such as fraying or burn marks. If you suspect the outlet is faulty, you can test it with another appliance or a voltage tester. A dead outlet means the problem lies with your home's wiring, not the oven itself. Remember, an electric oven needs a specific type of outlet. If you are unsure [how to know if you have an electric oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-an-electric-oven), identifying its power requirements is the first step.

Finally, consider any recent power outages or fluctuations in your area. Even a brief power surge can cause an appliance to shut down. Sometimes, simply unplugging the oven for a few minutes and then plugging it back in can reset its internal electronics. This is similar to restarting a computer. Always prioritize safety when dealing with electricity. If these basic checks do not restore power, the issue probably lies inside the oven itself.

## Faulty Heating Elements: A Common Culprit

After confirming power supply, your attention should turn to the heating elements. Electric ovens typically have two main heating elements: a bake element at the bottom and a broiler element at the top. These elements are responsible for producing the heat needed for cooking. If one or both of these elements fail, your electric oven just stopped working partially or completely. You might find your [Frigidaire oven not working but stove top is](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-frigidaire-oven-not-working-but-stove-top-is), which often points to a specific element failure.

Visual inspection is the first step. Carefully open your oven door and look at the heating elements. A healthy element glows red when heated. A damaged element might show visible signs of wear. Look for breaks, blisters, or areas where the metal appears corroded or charred. If you see any of these signs, the element has likely burned out. A completely dead oven means both elements, or a more central component, might be affected.

You can further test elements for continuity using a multimeter. This tool measures electrical current flow. First, disconnect the oven from power for safety. Then, access the terminals of the heating element. Most elements simply slide out after removing a few screws. Touch the multimeter probes to the two terminals of the element. A reading of zero or infinite resistance indicates an open circuit, meaning the element is faulty and needs replacement. A good element will show a specific resistance reading, usually between 10 and 50 ohms.

Remember that a faulty element can sometimes trip a circuit breaker. This happens if the element develops a short circuit. Replacing a heating element is a relatively straightforward repair for many DIY enthusiasts. However, always ensure the replacement part matches your oven's model number. Incorrect parts can cause further damage or safety hazards. Even if only one element appears faulty, a comprehensive check ensures no other issues are present.

## Malfunctioning Thermal Fuse: Safety Shut-Off

The thermal fuse is a crucial safety device in your electric oven. Its purpose is to protect the oven from overheating. If the oven's internal temperature exceeds a safe limit, the thermal fuse will blow, cutting off all power to the oven. This action prevents potential fires or damage to the oven's components. When your electric oven just stops working completely, with no lights or functions, a blown thermal fuse is a strong possibility.

A thermal fuse is a small, non-resettable component. Once it blows, it must be replaced. You cannot simply reset it. Finding the thermal fuse usually requires removing the oven's back panel. It often looks like a small cylinder with two wires connected to it. Before attempting to locate or test it, always unplug the oven from its power source. Safety comes first when working with electrical appliances.

To test the thermal fuse, use a multimeter set to measure continuity (ohms). Disconnect the wires leading to the fuse. Touch one probe of the multimeter to each terminal of the fuse. If the multimeter shows an "open circuit" or infinite resistance, the fuse has blown. A working fuse will show continuity, indicating a closed circuit. If you find the fuse is blown, you must replace it with an exact match for your oven model. Installing the wrong fuse can compromise the oven's safety features.

A blown thermal fuse indicates an underlying problem. While replacing the fuse will restore power, you should also investigate why it blew in the first place. Common causes include a malfunctioning cooling fan, a faulty thermostat, or prolonged high-temperature use. Sometimes, poor ventilation around the oven can also cause overheating. If you replace the fuse and it blows again quickly, call a professional. This indicates a more serious issue that requires expert diagnosis.

## Faulty Temperature Sensor: Incorrect Readings

An electric oven relies heavily on a functioning temperature sensor to regulate its heat. This sensor, often a small probe extending into the oven cavity, constantly monitors the internal temperature. It sends this information to the oven's control board. If the temperature sensor becomes faulty, it can send inaccurate readings. This leads the oven to either overheat, underheat, or sometimes, to completely stop working. The oven's safety mechanisms might interpret wildly incorrect readings as an error, shutting down the unit.

You can often see the temperature sensor inside the oven. It typically protrudes from the back wall or ceiling. It looks like a thin metal rod with two wires attached to it. Before testing, always unplug the oven from the wall outlet for safety. Accessing the sensor usually involves removing a few screws and gently pulling it out of its mounting. Be careful not to damage the wires.

To test the temperature sensor, use a multimeter set to measure resistance (ohms). Disconnect the sensor's wires. Touch one probe of the multimeter to each of the sensor's terminals. A healthy temperature sensor will show a specific resistance reading at room temperature, usually around 1080-1100 ohms (check your oven's service manual for the exact specification). As the sensor warms up (you can gently warm it with your hand or a hairdryer, though avoid extreme heat), the resistance reading should change gradually. If the multimeter shows an "open circuit" (infinite resistance) or a wildly fluctuating reading, the sensor is likely faulty.

A faulty temperature sensor can manifest in different ways. The oven might preheat slowly, maintain an inconsistent temperature, or simply refuse to heat at all. If your oven turns off by itself, it could be the temperature sensor sending erratic signals to the control board. For example, [why does my electric oven turn off by itself](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-electric-oven-turn-off-by-itself) could directly relate to this component failing. Replacing a temperature sensor is generally straightforward. Just ensure the new sensor is compatible with your specific oven model. Proper temperature regulation is essential for safe and effective cooking.

## Issues with the Oven Control Board: The Brain of the Oven

The oven control board, sometimes called the main control board or electronic control board (ECB), acts as the "brain" of your electric oven. It receives commands from the user, interprets signals from sensors, and sends instructions to various components like the heating elements and cooling fan. When your electric oven just stops working entirely, or displays strange error codes, a problem with the control board is a serious possibility. This is especially true if all other components appear fine.

Symptoms of a failing control board vary widely. You might see a blank display, unresponsive buttons, erratic heating cycles, or no power at all. The oven might fail to preheat, or it might get stuck in a self-cleaning cycle. Sometimes, the oven will turn on but immediately shut down. If your oven is burning the bottom of everything, it could be a control board failing to regulate the heat properly. It's often difficult to definitively diagnose a control board issue without ruling out all other possibilities first. A control board problem often presents as a general system failure rather than a specific component failure.

Visually inspecting the control board can sometimes reveal obvious signs of damage. Before doing this, always unplug the oven from the power supply. Remove the back panel or control panel to access the board. Look for burnt components, bulging capacitors, or any signs of liquid damage. A burnt smell coming from the control panel area also suggests a board problem. However, many failures are internal and not visible. Testing individual components on the board requires specialized knowledge and tools.

Replacing a control board is often one of the more expensive oven repairs. Due to its complexity and the sensitive nature of electronics, this repair is best left to a professional appliance technician. They have the diagnostic equipment and expertise to confirm if the control board is indeed the issue. While you can purchase replacement boards online, improper installation can lead to further damage or safety risks. If you suspect the control board, gather your oven's model number and contact a service professional.

## Faulty Door Switch or Latch: Safety Interlocks

Modern electric ovens incorporate safety features, and the door switch or latch assembly is a critical part of these. Many ovens will not start or continue heating if the door is not fully closed and latched. This prevents heat from escaping and protects users from hot surfaces or self-cleaning cycle fumes. If your electric oven just stops working or refuses to start, a malfunctioning door switch or latch could be the culprit.

The door switch is usually located near the oven door frame. It engages when the door closes. Some ovens have a latch mechanism that secures the door, especially during self-cleaning cycles. If this latch is stuck, broken, or misaligned, the oven's control board might interpret the door as being open. This prevents operation. You might notice the oven light staying on even when the door is closed, or the control panel not responding.

To check the door switch, first, ensure the oven is unplugged. Visually inspect the switch and the latch mechanism for any physical damage, debris, or misalignment. Sometimes, food particles or grease can interfere with the switch's operation. Clean the area thoroughly. You can also use a multimeter to test the continuity of the door switch. With the oven unplugged, disconnect the wires from the switch. Test for continuity when the switch is in both the "open" and "closed" positions (simulating the door opening and closing). A faulty switch will not show the correct change in continuity.

A common scenario is when an oven gets stuck after a self-cleaning cycle. The high heat of self-cleaning can sometimes cause the door latch to become stiff or to jam. If your oven just completed a self-clean cycle and now won't work, ensure the latch has fully disengaged. You might need to gently lubricate it or manually try to move it. If the switch or latch is broken, it will require replacement. While some switches are simple to replace, others are integrated into the latch assembly and might be more complex. Always use parts specific to your oven model.

## Internal Wiring Issues: Hidden Problems

Beyond major components, hidden internal wiring issues can also cause your electric oven to just stop working. Over time, wires can fray, corrode, or become loose due due to vibration or heat. A broken or shorted wire can completely cut off power to a section of the oven or to the entire unit. These issues are often difficult to diagnose without specific electrical knowledge and tools. They represent a more serious problem.

Symptoms of internal wiring issues are inconsistent. The oven might work intermittently, or specific functions (like baking but not broiling) might fail. You might smell burning plastic or rubber, indicating overheating wires. A completely dead oven, especially after a power surge or moving the appliance, could point to a main power wire becoming disconnected or damaged. These problems are serious safety hazards and should not be ignored.

Diagnosing wiring problems involves visually inspecting all accessible wiring harnesses and connections. First, unplug the oven from its power source. Remove the back panel and any other panels needed to access the internal wiring. Look for wires that appear burnt, melted, or disconnected. Pay close attention to connections at the heating elements, thermal fuse, control board, and terminal block. Ensure all screw terminals are tight and secure. Loose connections create resistance, which generates heat and can lead to failure.

Using a multimeter to test for continuity along specific wire paths can help pinpoint a break. However, this requires a wiring diagram for your oven model and a good understanding of electrical circuits. If you discover a burnt wire, simply replacing it might not be enough. You need to understand *why* it burnt. This could be due to an overloaded circuit, a short circuit in a component, or improper gauge wire. Attempting to repair complex internal wiring without proper knowledge is risky. It can lead to electrical shock, fire, or further damage to the appliance. For such issues, I always recommend calling a certified appliance technician. They have the expertise to safely diagnose and repair complex electrical faults.

Food spills and grease buildup can interfere with heating elements, block cooling vents, and even lead to electrical shorts. Make sure to clean your oven regularly. If you are wondering [how to clean electric oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-electric-oven), there are many effective methods. Pay attention to the heating elements, the oven cavity, and the door seals. A clean oven operates more efficiently and runs cooler, which is good for all its internal components. Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage surfaces or elements.

Periodically check the oven door seal or gasket. A worn or damaged seal allows heat to escape. This makes the oven work harder, leading to faster wear on heating elements and potentially tripping thermal fuses. You can easily replace a worn seal yourself. Just pull the old one off and press the new one into place. Ensuring a tight seal helps the oven maintain consistent temperatures, reducing strain on its heating and control systems.

Finally, pay attention to how you use your oven. Avoid excessive preheating or very long baking times at maximum temperature unless necessary. Ensure proper ventilation around the oven, especially if it's a built-in model. Blocked vents can lead to overheating. If you notice any unusual smells, sounds, or inconsistent heating, address them promptly. Early intervention can prevent minor issues from becoming major repairs.
