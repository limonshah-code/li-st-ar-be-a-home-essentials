### What Does E20 Mean on Bosch Dishwasher?

The E20 error on a Bosch dishwasher means the appliance detects a water drainage issue. Specifically, the machine struggles to pump water out effectively. This code often appears when water remains in the tub after a wash cycle should have completed. It acts as a warning that the dishwasher cannot proceed with its functions due to this drainage problem.

## Decoding the E20 Error on Your Bosch Dishwasher

When your Bosch dishwasher displays the E20 error, it clearly communicates a problem. This specific code points to an issue with water evacuation. The machine senses that water is not draining correctly or quickly enough. I have seen this happen in many homes, and it is a consistent indicator. It means your dishwasher's internal sensors have detected a fault in the drainage system.

This drainage issue can manifest in a few ways. You might notice standing water at the bottom of the wash tub. Sometimes, the cycle might stop mid-wash, and the E20 code appears. In other cases, the dishwasher might complete a cycle, but the dishes remain wet and dirty, with water still present. Understanding that E20 is a drainage error helps focus your troubleshooting efforts. This knowledge is your first step towards finding a solution.

The E20 error code is not just a random sequence of numbers. It is a diagnostic tool provided by Bosch. It helps you understand what part of the dishwasher system requires attention. Without codes like E20, diagnosing appliance problems would be much harder. Bosch dishwashers, like many modern appliances, use these codes to simplify troubleshooting. They guide you directly to the root of the problem.

For example, if your machine showed E09, it would point to a heating element problem, a very different issue. [What Does E-09 Mean on My Bosch Dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-does-e-09-mean-on-my-bosch-dishwasher) explains this other common code. The E20 error, however, always brings your attention to water flow *out* of the machine. This includes components like filters, hoses, and pumps. Knowing this helps you narrow down your investigation.

## Common Causes Behind the E20 Dishwasher Error

Several things can lead to your Bosch dishwasher showing an E20 error. It is usually a blockage or a mechanical fault within the drainage system. Identifying the exact cause is key to resolving the issue. I have found that most problems are relatively simple to fix. You just need to know where to look.

### Clogged Filters and Sump Area

The most frequent culprit for an E20 error is a clogged filter. Dishwasher filters catch food particles and debris. Over time, these particles accumulate. This build-up blocks the water flow to the drain pump. It prevents proper water drainage from the dishwasher tub.

If your Bosch dishwasher has water in the bottom, a dirty filter is a likely reason. [Why Does My Bosch Dishwasher Have Water in the Bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-bosch-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) offers more details on this common symptom. Regular cleaning of these filters is crucial for preventing such blockages. Food scraps, grease, and even small pieces of broken dishes can contribute to filter clogs.

### Kinked or Blocked Drain Hose

Another common cause is the drain hose itself. This hose carries the wastewater from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. It can become kinked, bent, or squashed behind the appliance. A kink restricts water flow. Over time, food debris or grease can also build up inside the hose, creating an internal blockage. This internal blockage acts like a dam, stopping water from leaving the dishwasher.

### Faulty Drain Pump

The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the dishwasher. If this pump malfunctions, water cannot be expelled. The pump might be worn out, or a foreign object could jam its impeller. A failing pump often makes unusual noises or no noise at all when it should be draining. A completely silent pump during the drain cycle is a strong indicator of a problem.

### Issues with the Air Gap or Sink Drain

Sometimes, the problem is not with the dishwasher itself but with the connected plumbing. If your sink has an air gap, it can become clogged. This affects the dishwasher's ability to drain. Similarly, a blocked sink drain, especially if the dishwasher drains into it, will prevent proper water flow. I often suggest checking your sink for drainage issues first, as it's an easy check.

### Pressure Sensor Malfunction

Less commonly, the E20 error might point to a faulty pressure sensor. This sensor monitors the water level inside the dishwasher. If it malfunctions, it might incorrectly detect that water is still present when it has actually drained. This sends a false signal to the control board, leading to an E20 error. This issue is rare but possible.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Troubleshooting Your Bosch Dishwasher

When your Bosch dishwasher displays an E20 error, do not panic. Most drainage issues are simple to fix with a bit of DIY effort. I recommend starting with the easiest and most common solutions first. This approach saves time and effort. You will usually solve the problem without needing professional help.

First, always ensure safety. Before you begin any inspection or repair, disconnect the dishwasher from its power supply. Unplug it from the wall socket. If it is hardwired, turn off the corresponding circuit breaker in your home's electrical panel. This prevents electric shock during your work. Safety is paramount when working with appliances.

Next, open the dishwasher door and visually inspect the tub's bottom. Is there standing water? If so, this confirms the drainage issue. You might need to manually remove some of this water. Use a towel or a small cup to bail out the excess water. This will make it easier to access the filter and drain area. I find a small shop vac works wonders for this task.

After removing excess water, examine the drain area more closely. Look for any obvious large obstructions. Sometimes, a forgotten utensil, a broken piece of glass, or a large food chunk might block the drain. Remove any visible debris immediately. This simple step can sometimes resolve the E20 error quickly. It is often surprising what small items can cause big problems.

Now, locate and inspect your dishwasher's filters. Bosch dishwashers typically have a multi-part filter system at the bottom of the tub. These filters can easily become clogged with food particles. If you notice any debris, you are on the right track. Cleaning these filters is a common first step in resolving the E20 error. I will explain how to do this in detail next.

## Cleaning the Filters and Drain Area

A dirty filter system is the most common cause of the E20 error on Bosch dishwashers. Thankfully, it is also one of the easiest fixes. I always tell people to start here. Regular filter cleaning is essential for your dishwasher's performance. It helps prevent blockages and ensures efficient drainage.

Here is how you clean your Bosch dishwasher's filters:

1.  **Locate the Filter Assembly:** Open the dishwasher door. Look at the bottom of the wash tub. You will see a cylindrical filter, often with a flat mesh screen around it. This is your filter assembly.
2.  **Remove the Coarse Filter:** Twist the cylindrical filter counter-clockwise. It should unlock and lift out easily. This is the coarse filter, designed to catch larger food particles.
3.  **Remove the Fine Filter (Microfilter):** Once the coarse filter is removed, you will likely see a flat microfilter underneath. This filter catches smaller particles. Carefully lift it out. Sometimes, it is integrated into the bottom base.
4.  **Rinse Under Running Water:** Take both filter parts to your sink. Rinse them thoroughly under warm, running water. Use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to gently scrub away any stubborn food residue, grease, or debris. I find that a little dish soap can help cut through greasy build-up.
5.  **Clean the Filter Housing:** While the filters are out, check the sump area in the bottom of the dishwasher. This is the cavity where the filters sit. Use a sponge or paper towel to wipe away any grime, slime, or food particles. Look for any foreign objects that might have bypassed the filter.
6.  **Reassemble the Filters:** Once both filters are clean, place the fine filter back into its position first. Then, insert the coarse filter, aligning it properly. Twist it clockwise until it locks securely into place. Ensure it is snug. A loose filter can allow debris into the drain pump.

After cleaning, run a short cycle without dishes. Observe if the water drains properly. If the E20 error persists, you can move on to checking the drain hose. This thorough cleaning often resolves the problem, restoring proper drainage to your Bosch dishwasher.

This guide offers valuable tips for maintaining your appliance.

## Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose

If cleaning the filters did not solve your E20 error, the next step is to examine the drain hose. The drain hose carries wastewater from your Bosch dishwasher to your household plumbing. Issues with this hose are common causes of drainage problems. I have seen many instances where a simple kink or blockage in the hose prevented proper operation.

First, you need to locate the drain hose. It typically connects from the back of the dishwasher to a T-fitting under your sink or to a garbage disposal unit. You might need to pull the dishwasher out slightly from its cabinet enclosure to gain full access to the back. Always remember to disconnect power before moving the appliance.

Visually inspect the entire length of the drain hose. Look for any visible kinks, bends, or crimps. These can restrict water flow, acting like a dam. Straighten out any kinks you find. Ensure the hose is not trapped or pinched behind the dishwasher or against the wall. A common issue is a hose getting squashed when the dishwasher is pushed back into place.

Next, check for internal blockages. This is harder to see but equally important. Disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink/disposal connection. You will need a bucket and towels ready, as some residual water may spill out. Once disconnected, you can try to flush water through the hose from a faucet. If water flows slowly or not at all, you have an internal blockage.

To clear an internal blockage, you can try a few methods:

*   **Snake or Wire:** Carefully use a plumber's snake or a stiff wire (like a coat hanger) to dislodge any blockages. Push it gently through the hose. Be careful not to puncture the hose.
*   **High-Pressure Water:** If possible, blast water through the hose from a garden hose to dislodge debris. Do this outdoors to avoid a mess.
*   **Replace the Hose:** If the hose is severely clogged, damaged, or cannot be cleared, replacing it might be the easiest solution. New drain hoses are relatively inexpensive and simple to install.

Finally, ensure the drain hose is correctly installed. It needs a high loop to prevent dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. This loop should be secured to the underside of the counter. Reconnect the hose securely to both the dishwasher and the sink drain or garbage disposal. Make sure all clamps are tight. After reassembling, run another test cycle to see if the E20 error has cleared.

## Addressing a Faulty Drain Pump: What You Need to Know

If you have cleaned the filters and checked the drain hose, but the E20 error persists, the drain pump might be the culprit. The drain pump is a vital component. It actively pushes water out of the dishwasher. When it malfunctions, water simply cannot exit the machine. This leads to the standing water and the E20 error.

Diagnosing a faulty drain pump can be tricky, but there are signs. I often listen for specific sounds. When the dishwasher is supposed to drain, listen carefully. Do you hear a humming noise but no water movement? This might indicate that the pump motor is working, but its impeller is jammed. Do you hear nothing at all? This could mean the pump motor has failed or is not receiving power.

Before assuming the pump is broken, check for obstructions in the pump itself. This requires more effort than cleaning filters.

1.  **Disconnect Power:** Always unplug the dishwasher first.
2.  **Remove Filters and Sump Cover:** Take out the filters as you did before. You will likely see a sump cover at the bottom of the tub. Remove any screws or clips holding it in place.
3.  **Access the Impeller:** Once the sump cover is off, you should see the drain pump impeller. This is a small fan-like component. Inspect it for foreign objects. Small pieces of glass, food, or even broken plastic can jam the impeller.
4.  **Clear Obstructions:** Carefully remove any objects you find. Use pliers or tweezers if needed. Try to rotate the impeller manually to ensure it moves freely. Sometimes, a simple clearing of debris is all that is required.

If the impeller is clear and moves freely, but the E20 error remains, the pump itself might be faulty. This could mean a worn-out motor, a damaged impeller, or an electrical problem with the pump. Replacing a drain pump is a more involved repair. It usually requires pulling the dishwasher out, tilting it on its side, and accessing the pump from underneath.

I generally recommend considering professional help for pump replacement. It involves electrical connections and water lines. If you are comfortable with appliance repair, you can purchase a replacement pump online or from a local appliance parts store. Ensure you get the correct part number for your specific Bosch model. However, for most people, this is the point where calling a technician becomes the sensible choice. Remember, if you are unsure, it is always safer to contact a qualified appliance repair specialist.

## Checking the Sump and Anti-Flood Devices

Sometimes, the E20 error is not directly due to a clog or a broken pump. It can relate to other internal components. The sump area, where the water collects before draining, is important. Also, Bosch dishwashers have anti-flood devices. These components work to prevent leaks. If they malfunction, they can trigger error codes, including E20.

The **sump** is the basin at the very bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is where the filters sit and where the drain pump draws water from. While cleaning filters, you already checked the visible part of the sump. However, debris can sometimes settle deeper or block smaller passages within the sump assembly. This can prevent water from reaching the drain pump efficiently. Use a flashlight to inspect the deeper parts of the sump. Ensure there are no hidden blockages.

Bosch dishwashers often include an **anti-flood device** or a **float switch**. This safety mechanism detects if water levels get too high. It also senses if water has leaked into the base pan of the dishwasher. If water is detected in the base pan, the anti-flood device activates. It can then trigger the drain pump to run continuously or stop the cycle. In some cases, it might even trigger an E20 error. This happens if it detects standing water where it should not be.

To check the anti-flood device:

1.  **Disconnect Power:** As always, ensure the dishwasher is unplugged.
2.  **Access the Base Pan:** This usually requires pulling the dishwasher out from its cabinet. You may need to remove the lower access panel (kick plate) at the front of the dishwasher.
3.  **Inspect for Leaks:** Look inside the base pan. Is there any standing water? Even a small amount of water can activate the flood switch. If you find water, it indicates a leak from somewhere else in the dishwasher. You will need to find and fix the source of that leak.
4.  **Check the Float Switch:** The float switch is typically a small styrofoam or plastic float. It sits in the base pan. If water collects, the float rises, activating a microswitch. Ensure this float is not stuck or obstructed. Make sure the switch it triggers is functioning correctly. You can often test the switch with a multimeter if you are familiar with electrical testing.

If you find water in the base pan, you must address the leak. The leak source could be a door seal, a hose connection, or a worn-out component. Resolving the leak and drying the base pan should clear the E20 error. If the float switch itself is faulty, it will need replacement. This is a less common issue but worth checking if all other drainage issues have been ruled out.

## When to Call a Professional for E20 Bosch Dishwasher Issues

While many E20 error issues are fixable through DIY troubleshooting, there comes a point when professional help is the best course of action. I encourage people to try the simple fixes first. However, knowing your limits prevents further damage or injury. Do not hesitate to call a technician if you encounter complex problems or feel uncomfortable with a repair.

Here are specific situations when you should call a professional:

*   **Persistent Error After Basic Troubleshooting:** You have thoroughly cleaned the filters, inspected the drain hose for kinks and blockages, and checked the drain pump for obstructions. The E20 error still appears. This suggests a deeper, more technical issue. It could be a faulty drain pump, a malfunctioning control board, or a complicated sensor problem.
*   **Electrical or Internal Component Issues:** If your diagnosis points to a faulty drain pump, a problematic pressure sensor, or an issue with the control board, a professional is best equipped to handle these repairs. These components involve electrical work and specific diagnostic tools. Incorrect handling can lead to further damage or safety hazards.
*   **Water in the Base Pan with Unknown Leak Source:** If you find water in the dishwasher's base pan, indicating a leak, but cannot locate the source, a technician can help. They have the expertise to identify leaks from seals, hoses, or internal components accurately.
*   **Lack of Confidence or Tools:** If you lack the necessary tools, experience, or confidence to perform the repairs yourself, it is always safer to hire a professional. Dishwashers involve water and electricity. Improper repairs can be dangerous.
*   **Under Warranty:** If your Bosch dishwasher is still under warranty, contact Bosch customer service or an authorized service center. Attempting complex DIY repairs might void your warranty. Always check your warranty terms before proceeding with any significant repair.
*   **Unusual Noises or Smells:** Beyond the E20 code, if you notice strange grinding noises from the drain pump area, burning smells, or excessive vibrations, these are signs of a more serious mechanical or electrical failure. These symptoms warrant immediate professional attention.

A qualified appliance repair technician has specialized knowledge and equipment. They can diagnose the exact cause of the E20 error quickly and safely. They also have access to genuine Bosch replacement parts. While there is a cost involved, it ensures the repair is done correctly and effectively. This can save you from bigger problems down the line.
