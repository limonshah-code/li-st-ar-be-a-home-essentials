### Glass Waterdrop Bottles: Dishwasher Safe Care

Glass Waterdrop bottles are a popular choice. They offer a clean taste and a premium feel. Glass is also one of the most dishwasher-friendly materials. Most glass bottles can go into your dishwasher without issue. They typically handle the heat and detergents well. This makes cleaning very convenient for daily users.

When loading your glass Waterdrop bottle, place it on the top rack. The top rack usually has gentler water spray and less direct heat. This placement reduces the risk of accidental damage. Avoid placing glass bottles where they might knock against other dishes during the wash cycle. Such impacts can cause chips or cracks. We always give our glass items space in the dishwasher.

Always remove the lid, straw, and any silicone rings from your glass bottle first. These parts are often made of plastic or silicone. They may require different care. Cleaning the glass body separately ensures a thorough wash. It also protects the more delicate components from excessive heat. This simple step keeps all parts in good condition.

Some glass bottles have decorative sleeves or prints. Check if these are secure before dishwashing. A high-temperature wash might loosen adhesives or fade certain designs.
