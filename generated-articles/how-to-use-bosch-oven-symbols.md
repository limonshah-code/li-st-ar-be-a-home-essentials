Your Bosch oven comes with many cooking symbols. These symbols help you prepare different types of food. Each symbol means a specific heating method. Knowing them helps you achieve perfect results every time. Let me explain the most common ones.

### Top and Bottom Heat (Conventional Heat)

This symbol looks like two horizontal lines. One line is at the top, and one is at the bottom. This means heat comes from the top and bottom elements. It is great for baking cakes, cookies, and casseroles. This setting provides even heat distribution. It does not use a fan. This ensures gentle cooking. You will use this often for traditional recipes.

### Fan Heat (Convection/Hot Air)

The fan heat symbol shows a fan blade inside a circle. This mode uses a fan to circulate hot air evenly. It cooks food faster and more uniformly. You can cook multiple dishes at once with this setting. It is good for roasting meats, baking bread, and preparing pizzas.

### Full-Width Grill

This symbol looks like a jagged line at the top of a square. It means the entire top heating element is active. This provides intense, direct heat. It is perfect for grilling larger amounts of food. You can use it for steaks, sausages, or toast. Remember to keep a close eye on your food. Grilling cooks food very quickly.

### Half-Width Grill

The half-width grill symbol shows a smaller jagged line at the top. This means only a part of the top heating element is active. It is good for grilling smaller portions of food. This saves energy compared to the full-width grill. It offers more precise control for delicate items.

### Circulated Air Grilling

This symbol combines the fan with the jagged grill line. It means the grill element and the fan work together. The fan circulates the hot air from the grill. This cooks food more evenly than a standard grill. It is ideal for roasting larger cuts of meat or poultry. It gives a crispy outside and a juicy inside. This function is helpful for dishes like a whole chicken.

### Bottom Heat

The bottom heat symbol is a single horizontal line at the bottom. This setting provides heat only from the bottom element. It is good for crisping up bases. You can use it for pizza, quiches, or pies. It also helps with browning the base of a dish. For instance, [how to use Bosch oven for pizza](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-bosch-oven-for-pizza) often involves using bottom heat or a specific pizza setting.

It helps create a true homemade pizza experience.

### Gentle Hot Air

The gentle hot air symbol usually looks like a fan with a small, wavy line underneath. This mode uses a lower temperature and less intense fan circulation. It is perfect for delicate foods.

It helps food cook thoroughly without browning too much.

### Defrost Function

The defrost symbol often looks like a snowflake or a fan with a water drop. This setting circulates unheated air. It gently thaws frozen food. You should not use heat for defrosting.
