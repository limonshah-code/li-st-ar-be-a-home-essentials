## Carpet Python Feeding: How Many Adult Mice Do They Eat?

Have you ever wondered about the precise dietary needs of a carpet python? These magnificent constrictors are popular pets, known for their striking patterns and generally docile nature. A crucial part of responsible ownership involves understanding their feeding habits, especially when it comes to prey like adult mice. Getting the feeding right ensures your snake lives a long, healthy life. This guide answers the question, "how much can a carpet python eating adult mice eat," covering everything from feeding frequency to appropriate prey size. We will explore various factors that influence a python's appetite, explain how to offer food safely, and discuss signs of good health related to diet.
