Taking on this task helps you save money and get your appliance working right again. This guide provides step-by-step instructions. We will cover the tools you need, how to find the part, and how to put everything back together. You can restore your dishwasher's performance and enjoy clean dishes once more.

### Takeaway

*   You can replace your KitchenAid dishwasher diverter motor at home.
*   This repair saves money compared to hiring a professional.
*   A new diverter motor restores full cleaning power to your dishwasher.

Replacing a KitchenAid dishwasher diverter motor involves accessing the sump area, disconnecting the old motor, and installing a new one. This process requires basic tools and careful attention to detail. You must disconnect power and water before starting the repair.

## Understanding Your Kitchenaid Dishwasher Diverter Motor

Your KitchenAid dishwasher relies on several parts to clean dishes. The diverter motor is one of these crucial components. It controls where water goes inside the wash tub. Dishwashers have multiple spray arms: one usually at the bottom, another in the middle, and sometimes a third at the top. The diverter motor changes the water path between these spray arms. This ensures all dishes get a thorough wash.

When the diverter motor works correctly, it cycles water to each spray arm at the right time. This creates an even spray pattern. All dishes, regardless of their position, receive enough water pressure to become clean. Think of it like a traffic cop for water. It directs the flow to ensure no area gets neglected. A properly functioning KitchenAid dishwasher diverter motor ensures optimal cleaning performance.

Common signs of a failing diverter motor include uneven cleaning. You might find dishes on the top rack are dirty, but those on the bottom rack are clean. Or, the reverse might be true. You may also hear unusual noises coming from the dishwasher during a wash cycle. This could be a grinding or buzzing sound. Sometimes, the dishwasher runs, but no water reaches the upper spray arm. These symptoms suggest the diverter motor is struggling to move water. Addressing this issue promptly helps you avoid further damage to your KitchenAid appliance. It also restores your dishwasher's full cleaning ability.

## Tools and Safety for Dishwasher Repair

Before you start any appliance repair, gather your tools. Having the right tools makes the job easier and safer. You will need a few common items found in most home toolkits. A Phillips head screwdriver is essential for removing screws. A flat-head screwdriver also helps with prying or gently lifting parts. Pliers are useful for gripping and twisting connections. You might need a pair of adjustable wrenches for water line connections. A small container or towel will catch any residual water.

Safety comes first when working with appliances. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher before you begin. You can do this by unplugging the unit from the wall outlet. If your dishwasher is hardwired, flip the circuit breaker off at your home's main electrical panel. Confirm the power is off by trying to turn the dishwasher on. No power means you are safe to proceed.

Next, shut off the water supply to the dishwasher. Look for the shut-off valve under your sink or behind the dishwasher. Turn it clockwise until the water flow stops completely. You should also have towels ready to absorb any spilled water. Wearing work gloves protects your hands from sharp edges or grime. Take your time with each step. Do not rush the process. Following these safety steps protects you from electrical shock or water damage. It also helps prevent accidental damage to your KitchenAid dishwasher.

## Accessing the Dishwasher Diverter Motor

The diverter motor sits at the bottom of your KitchenAid dishwasher. You need to pull the appliance out to reach it. First, open the dishwasher door and remove the lower dish rack. Take out any silverware baskets and the wash filter assembly. The filter usually twists out or unclips easily. You might find some standing water in the bottom of the tub. Use a towel or sponge to soak this up.

Next, you need to pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet space. Most dishwashers have mounting screws that secure them to the countertop or cabinet sides. Locate these screws. They are usually found under the countertop, attached to the dishwasher's mounting brackets. Use your Phillips head screwdriver to remove them. Gently pull the dishwasher forward from its opening. You may need to tilt it slightly to clear the countertop.

As you pull the dishwasher out, be careful with the water supply line and drain hose. These lines connect to fittings behind the appliance. Do not yank the dishwasher too hard. Once the dishwasher is pulled out, you can access its underside. Lay down a blanket or cardboard to protect your floor. Also, it makes the dishwasher easier to slide. You will see the various components attached to the bottom of the wash tub, including the diverter motor assembly. This initial access prepares you for the next steps in replacing your KitchenAid dishwasher diverter motor.

## Testing Your Kitchenaid Dishwasher Diverter Motor

Before you replace the diverter motor, you should confirm it is faulty. Visual inspection is the first step. Look for any signs of physical damage. Check for burnt marks, cracks, or loose wires on the motor housing. Sometimes, you can see if the internal gears are stripped by trying to turn the motor shaft by hand. It should move freely without excessive play.

You can also use a multimeter to test the motor's electrical continuity. Disconnect the electrical connector from the diverter motor. Set your multimeter to the ohms (resistance) setting. Touch the probes to the motor's electrical terminals. A healthy motor will show a specific resistance reading, often found in the dishwasher's service manual or on the new part's packaging. If the multimeter shows no reading (open circuit) or an extremely high resistance, the motor has failed. This confirms the motor is not receiving or processing electrical signals properly.

Sometimes, the issue is not the motor itself but the diverter valve. The motor turns a shaft that rotates a valve. This valve directs water. Check if the valve feels stuck or if its rubber seals are cracked. A stuck valve can mimic a bad motor. However, usually, if the motor makes unusual noises or shows no electrical continuity, it is the primary culprit. Confirming the fault saves you time and ensures you replace the correct part. This helps you avoid unnecessary KitchenAid dishwasher repairs. Understanding these diagnostics is key. It ensures you fix the actual problem.

## Removing the Old Diverter Motor

With your KitchenAid dishwasher pulled out and the power off, you are ready to remove the faulty diverter motor. The diverter motor assembly sits at the bottom of the dishwasher's sump. This is the basin where water collects during a wash cycle. Look for the motor attached to the underside of the plastic sump. You will see wires connecting to it.

First, disconnect all electrical connectors from the diverter motor. These connectors usually clip on. Press the tab and gently pull them off. Take note of where each wire connects. You can even snap a picture with your phone. This helps you reconnect them correctly later. Next, you need to detach the motor from the sump. The motor is often secured by a few screws or locking tabs. Use your Phillips head screwdriver to remove any mounting screws. Some models might require you to twist the motor to unlock it from the sump.

You might encounter some water leakage as you remove the motor. Have your towels ready to catch this water. The diverter motor connects to the internal water channels. When you separate it, some water may escape. Be careful not to damage any plastic tabs or connections on the sump. They are part of the main wash tub assembly. Remove the entire diverter motor and its housing. Keep any screws or small parts organized. This prevents them from getting lost during the replacement process. This step is critical for a smooth installation of the new KitchenAid dishwasher diverter motor.

## Installing Your New Kitchenaid Dishwasher Diverter Motor

Now you have the old diverter motor removed. It's time to install the new KitchenAid dishwasher diverter motor. Take your new diverter motor out of its packaging. Compare it to the old one. Ensure they match perfectly in size, shape, and connection points. You might notice a new gasket or seal on the new motor. This seal is very important. It prevents leaks. Make sure it is properly seated around the motor assembly.

Position the new diverter motor assembly into the opening in the sump. Make sure it aligns correctly with the mounting holes or locking tabs. If there are screws, insert them and tighten them down. Do not overtighten the screws. This can crack the plastic sump. If your model uses a twist-and-lock mechanism, push the motor up and twist it until it locks securely into place. You should feel it snap or click.

Reconnect all electrical connectors to the new diverter motor. Refer to the picture you took earlier or your notes to ensure each wire goes to its correct terminal. Push the connectors firmly until they click. A secure electrical connection is vital for the motor to function. Check that all wires are tucked away and not in a position to be pinched or damaged. Proper installation of the new motor ensures your KitchenAid dishwasher will distribute water effectively. It helps prevent future water flow issues. Remember, a tight seal here prevents leaks.

## Reassembly and Testing Your Dishwasher

With the new KitchenAid dishwasher diverter motor installed, it is time to put everything back together. Carefully slide the dishwasher back into its cabinet opening. Be mindful of the water supply line and drain hose. Make sure they do not kink or get pinched. Reconnect the mounting screws that secure the dishwasher to the countertop or cabinet sides. Tighten these screws until the dishwasher is stable and does not wobble.

Next, reconnect the water supply line to the dishwasher. Turn the shut-off valve counter-clockwise to restore water flow. Check for any leaks at the connection point. Reinstall the wash filter assembly and the lower dish rack inside the dishwasher tub. Ensure the filter is seated properly. Otherwise, it can affect drainage. If you are also replacing other components like the main control board or water inlet valve, make sure those are properly installed and connected too. Information on how to replace parts such as the [KitchenAid dishwasher control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-kitchenaid-dishwasher-control-board) or the [KitchenAid dishwasher water inlet valve](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-kitchenaid-dishwasher-water-inlet-valve) can be helpful.

Finally, plug the dishwasher back into its electrical outlet. If it is hardwired, flip the circuit breaker back on. Run a short test cycle. Listen for unusual noises and watch for water distribution. Open the door briefly (if safe to do so) to confirm water is spraying from all arms. Check under the dishwasher for any leaks. If you notice water pooling at the bottom, or your dishes still come out dirty, you might need to recheck your installation or troubleshoot other issues. Sometimes, problems like water standing at the bottom can be linked to other drain issues, but poor cleaning after a diverter replacement could point to a misdiagnosis.
