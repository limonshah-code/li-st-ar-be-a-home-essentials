### Safety First: Essential Steps Before You Clean

Before you even think about grabbing a brush, safety must be your priority. I cannot stress this enough. Working with power tools, even when cleaning them, holds potential risks. Taking a few moments to ensure safety prevents serious accidents.

The most critical step is to disconnect the power source. For corded tools, unplug them from the wall outlet. For cordless tools, remove the battery pack. Do this without fail. This action prevents the tool from accidentally activating during cleaning. An unexpected start can cause severe injury. Always double-check that the tool is completely de-energized.

Next, allow the tool to cool down. If you just finished using a tool, it might be hot. Motors and blades can retain heat for some time. Touching hot parts can cause burns. Give your tool at least 15-20 minutes to return to room temperature. This simple wait protects your hands. It also prevents any cleaning solutions from evaporating too quickly on a hot surface.

Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). I always put on safety glasses or goggles. Small bits of dust or debris can fly off during cleaning. Eye protection keeps your vision clear and your eyes safe. Gloves are also a good idea. They protect your hands from dirt, sharp edges, and cleaning chemicals. A dust mask is important if you are cleaning very dusty tools. You do not want to inhale fine particles.

Clear your workspace. Make sure you have enough room to work safely. Remove any clutter or flammable materials from around your cleaning area. A tidy space reduces the chance of knocking things over. It also provides better access to your tool for thorough cleaning. Have your cleaning supplies organized and ready to go.
