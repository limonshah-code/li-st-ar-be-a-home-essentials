### Burner Caps and Grates

Burner caps and grates are on top of your stove. They are made of metal, often cast iron or enamel. These parts are made to be removed and cleaned. Water on these parts usually causes no harm. You can wash them with soap and water.

After washing, you must dry them well. Water left on cast iron can cause rust. Rust can make your stove look bad. It can also make parts stick.

### Igniters and Spark Modules

Beneath the burner caps are the igniters. Igniters create a spark to light the gas. They are small ceramic rods with metal tips. These parts are electrical. The spark module sends power to them. Water can stop igniters from working.

If an igniter gets wet, it might not spark. This means your burner will not light. Water can also cause an electrical short circuit. This could damage the igniter or spark module permanently.

### Gas Supply Lines and Valves

Your gas stove connects to a gas supply line. This line brings natural gas or propane to your stove. Inside the stove, valves control the gas flow. These parts are designed to be sealed. They keep gas contained safely.

Water should not reach these internal gas parts. If water gets into the gas lines or valves, it is serious. It can affect gas flow. It might even cause a gas leak. This is a rare event, but it is dangerous.

## Accidental Spills vs. Substantial Water Exposure

Water and gas stoves do not mix well. However, not all water exposure is the same. There is a big difference between a small spill and a lot of water. Understanding this difference helps you react correctly. A little bit of water often poses no serious threat. A lot of water can be very dangerous.

You might spill water during cooking. This is usually not a big deal. Water from an overflowing pot is also common. These situations need quick action. A flood or major leak is a different scenario entirely. Each situation demands a specific response.

### Small Spills During Cooking

Small spills happen all the time. A few drops of water might land on the burner. Perhaps a little bit splashes from a pan. These minor spills often evaporate quickly due to the stove's heat. They usually do not reach sensitive parts.

If a burner is on, the water turns to steam. If the stove is off, the water just sits. You can wipe these small spills away with a cloth. Make sure to dry the area completely.

### Overflowing Pots

An overflowing pot means more water. Pasta water or soup can boil over. This water can spread across the cooktop. It can run into the burner openings. This is where it becomes a problem. The water can reach the igniters. It can also get into the gas orifices.

When a pot overflows, turn off the burner. Remove the pot. Wipe up the water quickly. You might need to remove burner parts for drying. This helps prevent damage and ensures the stove lights again. Regular cleaning helps prevent buildup that can hold water. [Learn how to clean gas stoves properly](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-gas-stoves).
