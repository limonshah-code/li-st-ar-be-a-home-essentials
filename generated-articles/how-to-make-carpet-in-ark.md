## Crafting Cozy Carpets in Ark: A Complete Guide

Ever felt your Ark base lacked that final touch of comfort? Imagine stepping onto a soft surface after a long day of taming dinosaurs. Learning how to make carpet in Ark can transform your rough-and-tumble shelters into truly inviting homes. This guide will walk you through the entire process, from gathering essential resources to placing your beautiful new floor coverings.

I will share the steps needed to craft carpets in Ark: Survival Evolved. You will understand the engram requirements, gather the right materials, and use the correct crafting station. We will also explore creative ways to integrate carpets into your base design. Get ready to add warmth and style to your Ark sanctuary.

### Takeaway:
*   Unlock the Carpet Engram at Level 38.
*   Gather Wool, Hide, and Fiber resources.
*   Craft carpets at a Fabricator.
*   Use carpets for aesthetics, comfort, and minor insulation.

To make carpet in Ark, you must first unlock its engram at level 38. Then, gather 50 Wool, 25 Hide, and 50 Fiber. Take these materials to a Fabricator, a powered crafting station, and select the Carpet engram to begin crafting. Each crafted carpet provides a small area of soft flooring for your base.

### The Value of Carpets in Your Ark Base

Carpets in Ark: Survival Evolved offer more than just aesthetic appeal. They provide a sense of comfort and refinement to your structures. Many survivors overlook these decorative items, but they significantly enhance base living. A well-placed carpet can transform a functional space into a cozy retreat.

I find that carpets make my bases feel much more like a home. The visual warmth they add is truly noticeable. They help create a welcoming atmosphere for both you and your tribe members. Consider adding them to your common areas or personal quarters.

Beyond looks, carpets offer a small but tangible benefit. They subtly increase your character's comfort stat when stood upon. This comfort can contribute to minor health regeneration or reduced food and water drain. It is a small bonus, but every advantage counts in Ark.

Using carpets helps break up monotonous stone or metal floors. They introduce texture and color into your designs. This small detail can make a large difference in how you perceive your base. I always feel more relaxed in a carpeted room.

Moreover, carpets can delineate different zones within a larger room. You can use them to mark a lounging area, a crafting corner, or a sleeping space. This visual separation aids in organization and makes your base more intuitive to navigate. Think of them as soft, inviting boundaries.

### Gathering Essential Resources for Ark Carpet Crafting

Crafting carpets in Ark requires specific materials you must gather from the world. Each ingredient plays a crucial role in the final product. Knowing where to find these resources efficiently saves you time and effort. I always prepare a gathering run before starting any large crafting project.

The primary resource for carpets is Wool. You obtain Wool by shearing Ovis, the fluffy sheep-like creatures found in various biomes. Ovis are generally docile but can be hard to spot in dense forests. I often find them grazing in open fields or on mountain slopes.

To shear an Ovis, you need shears, a tool crafted from Metal Ingots and Wood. Approach the Ovis and use the shears on it; you will collect Wool. Remember that Ovis also drop Raw Mutton, an excellent taming food. Taming a few Ovis and setting them to wander near your base can provide a steady supply of Wool, allowing you to [make a mat out of carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-a-mat-out-of-carpet) or any other carpet-based decor.

Next, you need Hide. Hide is a common resource obtained by harvesting dead creatures with a hatchet or pickaxe. Almost any creature in Ark will drop Hide, from small Dodos to large Brontosauruses. Larger creatures generally yield more Hide per kill.

My preferred method for gathering Hide is hunting medium-sized dinosaurs like Carbonemys or Triceratops. They are relatively easy to kill and provide a good amount of Hide. Early in the game, Dodos and Lystrosaurus are also decent sources. Ensure you have a good tool for harvesting to maximize your yield.

Finally, Fibers are essential for making carpets. Fibers are found by gathering plants and bushes by hand or with a sickle. They are abundant throughout Ark's landscapes. Simply walk through grassy areas and interact with the vegetation to collect them.

Using a sickle significantly increases your Fiber gathering rate. I always carry one when planning to collect large quantities. While you can collect Fibers anywhere, lush jungle areas or open plains often have denser plant life. Gathering these resources is the first big step in learning [how to put carpet together](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-carpet-together) in Ark.

### Unlocking the Carpet Engram: Prerequisites and Levels

Before you can craft carpets, you must first learn the Carpet Engram in your character's engram tree. Engrams are blueprints that unlock crafting recipes for various items and structures. Each engram requires a specific character level and a certain number of engram points. Understanding these requirements is key to progression in Ark.

The Carpet Engram unlocks at Player Level 38. This means your character must reach level 38 before you can even see the option to learn it. Leveling up involves gaining experience points (XP) from various activities like crafting, harvesting, killing creatures, and exploring. I always prioritize activities that give good XP early on.

Upon reaching Level 38, you will need 12 Engram Points to unlock the Carpet Engram. Engram Points are awarded each time you level up. The number of points you get per level increases as you progress through the game. Make sure you save enough points, as many useful engrams become available around this level.

To access the engram tree, open your inventory (default key 'I') and navigate to the 'Engrams' tab. Here, you will see a vast network of available blueprints. You can use the search bar to quickly find "Carpet" or browse through the different categories. Click on the Carpet Engram and then click 'Learn Engram' to unlock it.

Unlocking the Carpet Engram also automatically unlocks the Stone Wall Engram and the Stone Foundation Engram if you haven't already learned them. This is because carpets are considered a form of flooring. Make sure you have the necessary prerequisite engrams if any. You cannot learn an advanced engram without first learning its basic components. Learning this engram is the definitive step for those wondering [how to make carpet in Ark](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-carpet-in-ark).

It's important to plan your engram point distribution carefully. There are far more engrams than you can learn on a single character, especially if playing on official servers without custom settings. Focus on what you need most for your current base and activities. You can always respec your engrams later with a Mindwipe Tonic, but it is a costly item.

### The Step-by-Step Carpet Crafting Process in Ark

Once you have gathered your resources and unlocked the Carpet Engram, you are ready to start crafting. The process itself is straightforward, but it requires the correct crafting station. Not all items can be crafted by hand in Ark. Knowing which station to use is crucial for efficient base development.

To craft a carpet, you must use a Fabricator. The Fabricator is an advanced crafting station, a tier above the Smithy. It requires gasoline to operate, which means you also need to have unlocked and crafted an Industrial Grinder or a Chemistry Bench to make gasoline from Oil and Hide. I always ensure my Fabricator has a good supply of gasoline before starting a large crafting session.

First, power on your Fabricator by placing gasoline in its inventory and turning it on. Then, transfer the required resources – Wool, Hide, and Fiber – into the Fabricator's inventory. Make sure you have the exact amounts needed for each carpet you plan to craft. Remember, each carpet needs 50 Wool, 25 Hide, and 50 Fiber.

Next, open the Fabricator's crafting menu. You can do this by interacting with the Fabricator. Navigate through the engrams until you find the "Carpet" option. It will typically be under the 'Decoratives' or 'Structures' category. The game will show you the required ingredients and how many you can craft with your current supplies.

Click on the "Craft One" button to make a single carpet or "Craft All" if you have enough resources for multiple. The Fabricator will then begin the crafting animation. The process takes a few seconds per carpet. Once crafted, the carpet will appear in the Fabricator's inventory. You can then transfer it to your own inventory or directly place it in your base. This detailed method is similar to how you would [make carpet in Minecraft](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-carpet-in-minecraft), by gathering specific ingredients and using a crafting station.

Crafting carpets at a Fabricator is much more efficient than hand-crafting or using simpler stations. The Fabricator also allows for bulk crafting, which is helpful if you plan to carpet a large area. Always double-check your resource counts before starting to avoid interruptions.

### Creative Uses and Placement Tips for Ark Carpets

Carpets are versatile decorative items that can significantly enhance your Ark base's look and feel. They are not just for covering floors; with a little creativity, they can define spaces and add unique touches. I enjoy experimenting with different carpet layouts to achieve specific aesthetic goals. Knowing [what do you put under a carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-do-you-put-under-a-carpet) in the real world might be important for insulation, but in Ark, it is mainly about how you place the carpet itself.

One of the most common uses is to simply add warmth and comfort to living areas. Place carpets in bedrooms, common rooms, or even around your crafting stations. This makes these areas feel more inviting and reduces the harshness of bare metal or stone. A soft carpet underfoot can make a big difference in a base's ambiance.

Carpets are excellent for defining specific zones within an open-plan structure. For example, you can use a large carpet to demarcate a dining area from a lounge area. Lay down a smaller carpet around your personal storage chest and bed to create a private corner. This visual separation helps organize your base and makes it more functional.

You can also use carpets as a decorative underlay for other furniture. Place them under tables, chairs, or even around your smithy. This adds depth and visual interest to your furniture arrangements. I often use carpets as a base layer for my trophy room, making the displays stand out more.

Consider using carpets on upper floors or in areas with different material types. A wooden floor can look even better with a carefully placed carpet, providing contrast and texture. Carpets snap easily to foundations and ceilings (as floors), making placement simple. Just select the carpet from your hotbar and aim at the desired floor tile.

Don't be afraid to mix and match carpet colors if you have different variants. While the standard carpet is usually a solid color, events or mods might introduce varied options. Experiment with patterns or blocks of color to create unique designs. A little creativity goes a long way in making your Ark base truly your own.

### Maintaining Your Ark Carpets and Base Aesthetics

Maintaining your Ark carpets is relatively simple, as they do not degrade over time like some other structures. However, maintaining the overall aesthetic of your base, including your carpets, involves careful planning and occasional touch-ups. I find that a well-maintained base improves my overall Ark experience.

Unlike real-world carpets, Ark carpets do not get dirty or require cleaning. You do not need to worry about spills or wear and tear. This is a huge convenience, as resource management is already a major part of the game. Once placed, your Ark carpets will retain their pristine condition indefinitely.

However, ensuring your carpets contribute positively to your base's look means considering their surroundings. Does the carpet color match the walls? Is it placed evenly? Sometimes, repositioning a carpet by picking it up and placing it again can improve the overall visual flow. You might consider how to [keep a carpet down](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-a-carpet-down) in the real world, but in Ark, they simply snap into place and stay.

If you are using multiple carpets to cover a large area, ensure they are placed flush against each other. Ark's snapping system makes this easy, but occasional misalignments can happen. Picking up and re-snapping can fix any gaps or overlaps, ensuring a seamless floor. This attention to detail elevates your base's appearance.

Consider the lighting in your carpeted areas. Good lighting can highlight the texture and color of your carpets, making them stand out. Placing standing torches, electric lamps, or even bioluminescent plants around carpeted zones can create a warm, inviting glow. Strategic lighting makes a difference.

Finally, regularly survey your base to ensure all elements, including carpets, are where they should be. Over time, base designs evolve, and what worked initially might not suit future expansions. Don't hesitate to redesign and move carpets around to keep your base fresh and functional. A well-designed base, with thoughtful carpet placement, provides a calm and comfortable environment for all your Ark adventures.

### Advanced Carpet Crafting and Base Design Strategies

While the basic carpet provides a single-tile floor, advanced players can use them in more sophisticated ways. Thinking beyond simple floor coverings opens up new possibilities for interior design in Ark. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what is possible with decorative items. These strategies transform a simple carpet into a powerful design element.

One advanced strategy involves using carpets to create multi-level visual effects. You can place carpets on ceilings to add texture and color from below. This works particularly well in large open areas or structures with high ceilings. It creates an interesting visual dynamic, drawing the eye upwards.

Another technique is combining carpets with other flooring types. For instance, you might use stone floors in high-traffic areas and then transition to carpets in more private or comfortable zones. This not only adds visual variety but also subtly signals a change in purpose for different parts of your base. Mixing materials creates a richer environment.

For those on servers with access to specific mods or event-themed items, different colored carpets might be available. Collecting a variety of colors allows you to create intricate patterns or even pixel art on your floors. This requires a good eye for design and careful planning, but the results can be stunning. Custom designs make your base truly unique.

Consider using carpets as a soft landing for short drops. While not providing significant fall damage reduction, they can give the impression of a softer landing zone. This is purely aesthetic but adds to the immersion of your base design. It's a small detail that contributes to the overall feel.

Finally, integrate carpets with your furniture and decorations. Place small carpets under display cases, next to beds, or beneath seating arrangements. This helps anchor your furniture in the room and prevents them from looking like they are floating in space. A well-thought-out interior uses all elements in harmony. Thinking creatively about carpet placement elevates your entire base design, making it a masterpiece of survival architecture.
