## LG Refrigerator LMXS28626s Air Filter: Simple Replacement Guide

Maintaining your LG refrigerator is important. It ensures your food stays fresh and safe. A key part of this maintenance involves changing the air filter. Specifically, if you own an LG Refrigerator LMXS28626s, you know it works hard to keep items cool. But did you know it also has an air filter? This filter plays a silent yet crucial role. It purifies the air inside your fridge. This helps to eliminate odors and keep food smelling and tasting good.

Many people overlook this small but mighty component. However, neglecting the air filter can lead to stale odors. It can also cause cross-contamination of food flavors. This guide will walk you through the entire process. I will show you how to change the air filter in your LG Refrigerator LMXS28626s. We will cover why it matters, what you need, and a step-by-step procedure. By the end, you will feel confident replacing this essential part. This will help you keep your fridge running efficiently and your food fresher for longer. Let's make sure your refrigerator operates at its best.

### Takeaway

*   Regularly changing your LG LMXS28626s air filter is essential for fresh food and odor control.
*   The filter removes odors and airborne particles, improving internal air quality.
*   Replacement is a simple DIY task requiring minimal tools.
*   Use only genuine LG Pure N Fresh filters for optimal performance.
*   Proper air filter maintenance extends food freshness and improves overall refrigerator efficiency.

To change the air filter in your LG Refrigerator LMXS28626s, locate the Pure N Fresh filter compartment at the rear of the fresh food section. Open the filter cover, remove the old filter, and insert a new one, ensuring it clicks into place. Reset the filter indicator if your model has one.

### Understanding Your LG Refrigerator Air Filter

Every LG Refrigerator LMXS28626s comes with an air filter. This is not just a fancy addition; it serves a practical purpose. This filter, often called a Pure N Fresh filter, actively circulates air. It removes impurities from the air inside your refrigerator. Think of it as a breath of fresh air for your groceries. The filter uses activated carbon technology. This material excels at trapping odor molecules.

Without this filter, odors from strong-smelling foods, like onions or leftover meals, would mix. These smells could then transfer to other foods. Your fresh berries might start tasting like garlic. Nobody wants that. The air filter works constantly to keep the internal environment clean. It helps maintain the ideal conditions for food storage. A clean filter ensures a consistent flow of clean air. This helps to extend the shelf life of your produce and dairy.

The LMXS28626s model often features a dedicated compartment for this filter. It is usually located at the back of the refrigerator section. This placement allows it to capture odors efficiently. The filter unit often has an indicator or a small light. This light reminds you when it is time for a replacement. Ignoring this indicator means your filter is likely saturated. A saturated filter cannot absorb any more odors. This makes your refrigerator less effective at keeping things fresh.

### Why Changing Your LMXS28626s Air Filter Matters

Changing the air filter in your LG LMXS28626s refrigerator is more important than you might think. Many people focus on water filters, but air quality inside the fridge is just as critical. A clean air filter directly impacts the freshness and longevity of your food. Over time, the activated carbon in the filter becomes saturated with odor molecules. When this happens, the filter stops working. It can no longer absorb new smells.

This leads to several problems. First, you might notice unpleasant odors inside your refrigerator. These smells can transfer to other foods. Your fresh fruit might pick up the scent of last night's fish. Second, the air circulation can become less effective. This may not directly impact cooling, but it certainly affects overall food quality. Stagnant, odor-filled air does not create the best environment for sensitive items.

Third, a well-maintained filter contributes to the overall hygiene of your appliance. It helps prevent the buildup of mold or bacteria that thrive in stagnant, humid environments, although its primary role is odor elimination. By regularly replacing the air filter, you are actively protecting your food investments. You are also ensuring that your LG LMXS28626s operates as intended. This simple task is a quick win for better food preservation. It makes your refrigerator a more pleasant place to store items.

### Identifying the Right Air Filter for Your LMXS28626s

Choosing the correct replacement air filter is essential for optimal performance. LG refrigerators, including the LMXS28626s, use specific filter models. You cannot just pick any air filter. The LMXS28626s typically uses the LG LT120F Pure N Fresh refrigerator air filter. This is a very common filter type for LG French door and side-by-side refrigerators. It is designed to fit perfectly into the dedicated compartment.

Before buying, always double-check your refrigerator's owner's manual. The manual will list the exact filter part number. This ensures you purchase the correct one. You can also look for a label on your current air filter. The part number is often printed directly on the filter itself. Using a genuine LG LT120F filter is highly recommended. These filters are specifically engineered to work with your LG refrigerator's system. They meet LG's quality and performance standards.

Aftermarket or generic filters might seem cheaper. However, they may not offer the same level of odor absorption. They might also not fit as securely. A poorly fitting filter can reduce its effectiveness. It may allow odors to bypass the filter material. Always prioritize quality and compatibility. This small investment ensures your LMXS28626s continues to provide fresh, odor-free storage for your food. You want your refrigerator to function at its peak.

### Tools and Safety Before You Begin

Changing the air filter in your LG LMXS28626s is a straightforward task. It requires minimal tools. In most cases, you will not need any tools at all. The process is designed to be user-friendly. The main "tool" you need is the replacement air filter itself. Ensure you have the correct LG LT120F Pure N Fresh filter on hand before you start. Having the right filter ready saves time and hassle.

Safety is important for any home maintenance task. Fortunately, changing the air filter in your refrigerator carries very low risk. You do not need to turn off the power to the refrigerator. You do not need to turn off the water supply either. Unlike changing a water filter, this process does not involve water lines or electrical components. You can perform this task safely with the refrigerator running. This makes it convenient.

Just be gentle when handling the filter compartment. Refrigerator plastic components can sometimes be fragile. Avoid forcing anything. If you have sensitive skin, you might consider wearing thin gloves. This prevents direct contact with any dust or residue on the old filter. Keep a small trash can nearby for immediate disposal of the old filter. This helps keep your kitchen clean during the process. Preparing these few things makes the job even smoother.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Replacing the Air Filter in Your LG LMXS28626s

Ready to replace your air filter? Follow these simple steps. This guide ensures a smooth process for your LG Refrigerator LMXS28626s.

#### Locating the Air Filter Compartment

First, open the fresh food section of your LG LMXS28626s refrigerator. The air filter is typically located at the top rear wall of the refrigerator compartment. Look for a small, rectangular cover. This cover usually has "Pure N Fresh" or "Air Filter" written on it. It might also have a small fan symbol. The exact position can vary slightly, but it is almost always at the back, near the top.

#### Opening the Filter Cover

Once you find the filter cover, you need to open it. Many LG models have a push-to-release mechanism. Gently press on the cover. It should pop open or swing down. Some models might have small tabs or clips that you need to pinch or slide. Do not force the cover. If it does not open easily, check your refrigerator's manual for specific instructions. The goal is to access the old filter inside.

#### Removing the Old Air Filter

With the cover open, you will see the old air filter. It usually sits in a small tray or slot. Carefully pull the old filter straight out. It should slide out without much resistance. Notice how it sits in the compartment. This will help you correctly insert the new one. The old filter might look a bit dusty or discolored. This is normal. It shows the filter has been doing its job. Dispose of the old filter properly.

#### Installing the New Air Filter

Now, take your new LG LT120F Pure N Fresh air filter. Remove it from its packaging. Make sure it is oriented correctly. There is often an arrow indicating the airflow direction. Or, it simply matches the shape of the slot. Slide the new filter into the compartment. Push it firmly until it clicks into place. It should sit snugly. You will feel it settle into its position. This ensures it forms a proper seal.

#### Closing the Filter Cover

Once the new filter is in place, close the filter cover. Push it back until it securely latches. You should hear a click as it closes. Double-check that it is completely shut. A securely closed cover ensures proper air circulation through the filter.

#### Resetting the Filter Indicator (If Applicable)

Some LG LMXS28626s models have a filter indicator light on the control panel. This light reminds you when to change the filter. After replacement, you need to reset this indicator. The reset process varies by model. Usually, you press and hold a "Filter" or "Air Filter" button on the control panel for three to five seconds. The light should turn off or change color. Refer to your owner's manual for the exact reset procedure for your LMXS28626s model. If you are also replacing your water filter, remember that those have their own reset procedure.

### Post-Replacement Checks and Maintenance Tips

After you successfully change the air filter in your LG LMXS28626s, there are a few things to keep in mind. These steps ensure your refrigerator continues to perform its best. They also help you maintain overall appliance health.

#### Initial Checks

*   **Check for Odors:** Within a few hours, you should notice a significant improvement in the air quality inside your refrigerator. The stale odors should diminish or disappear completely. If strong odors persist, double-check that the filter is seated correctly. Also, inspect for any spoiled food that might be the source of persistent smells.
*   **Confirm Indicator Reset:** If your model has a filter indicator, ensure it is off or reset. This confirms the refrigerator recognizes the new filter. It also starts the timer for the next replacement reminder.

#### Ongoing Maintenance Tips

*   **Regular Replacement Schedule:** LG recommends changing the air filter every six months. Mark your calendar or set a reminder. Consistent replacement is key to optimal performance. Don't wait until odors become noticeable. By then, the filter is likely long overdue for a change.
*   **Clean the Compartment:** When you change the filter, take a moment to wipe down the filter compartment. A damp cloth can remove any dust or debris. This helps maintain a clean environment for the new filter.
*   **Proper Food Storage:** Even with a good air filter, proper food storage is important. Use airtight containers for strong-smelling foods like onions, garlic, and cheeses. This reduces the burden on your air filter. It also prevents cross-contamination of flavors.
*   **Consider Other Filters:** Your LG refrigerator likely has a water filter too. These also need regular replacement. Understanding [how to replace an LG French door refrigerator water filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-french-door-refrigerator-water-filter) is another good skill. Sometimes, you can even [change an LG refrigerator water filter without turning off the water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-change-an-lg-refrigerator-water-filter-without-turning-off-water), making that process easier too.
*   **Monitor for Performance:** Pay attention to how your refrigerator smells and functions. If odors return quickly, or if the indicator light comes on sooner than expected, it might signal another issue. However, in most cases, regular filter changes prevent problems.

By following these post-replacement checks and maintenance tips, you ensure your LG LMXS28626s continues to provide a fresh and efficient storage environment for your food. This proactive approach saves you time and frustration in the long run.

### Troubleshooting Common Air Filter Issues

Sometimes, even with a new air filter, you might encounter minor issues. These are often easy to fix. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps you quickly resolve problems.

#### Persistent Odors After Replacement

If you still smell odors after changing the filter, consider these points:

*   **Spoiled Food:** The most common reason for lingering odors is spoiled food. Check all compartments. Look for forgotten leftovers, expired dairy, or rotting produce. Remove any culprits immediately.
*   **Deep Clean:** A deep clean of the refrigerator interior might be necessary. Wipe down shelves, drawers, and walls with a mild cleaner. Odors can cling to surfaces.
*   **Baking Soda:** Place an open box of baking soda in the refrigerator. It helps absorb lingering smells. Replace it every few months.
*   **Filter Orientation:** Double-check that the new filter is installed correctly. Ensure it is not backwards. Also, confirm it is fully seated in its compartment.

#### Filter Indicator Light Stays On

If the filter indicator light does not turn off after replacement, try these steps:

*   **Reset Procedure:** Re-attempt the reset procedure. Press and hold the "Filter" or "Air Filter" button firmly for the recommended duration (usually 3-5 seconds). Consult your manual for the exact button and timing.
*   **Power Cycle (Last Resort):** As a last resort, you can try unplugging the refrigerator for 5 minutes. Then plug it back in. This sometimes resets the control board. Do this only if other methods fail.

#### Difficulty Removing/Inserting Filter

If the filter is stuck or difficult to insert:

*   **Review Manual:** Consult your LG LMXS28626s owner's manual. It provides diagrams and specific instructions for your model.
*   **Gentle Pressure:** Apply steady, gentle pressure. Do not force the filter. Plastic parts can break.
*   **Correct Filter:** Ensure you have the correct LG LT120F filter. An incorrect size will not fit properly.

Most air filter issues are simple. They often involve forgotten food or a missed reset step. Addressing these quickly ensures your LG LMXS28626s maintains fresh air quality. This helps your refrigerator perform at its best, ensuring your food stays fresh and palatable for longer periods. Regular attention to these details prevents small problems from becoming bigger frustrations.
