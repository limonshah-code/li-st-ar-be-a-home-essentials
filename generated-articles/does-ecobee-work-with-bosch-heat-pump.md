### Wiring the Ecobee Thermostat

Match the wire labels from your old thermostat to the Ecobee terminals. Standard heat pump wiring usually includes:

*   **R or Rc:** 24VAC power (common)
*   **W or W1:** Heat (auxiliary or first stage)
*   **Y or Y1:** Cooling (first stage compressor)
*   **G:** Fan
*   **C:** Common wire (for continuous power)
*   **O/B:** Reversing valve (for heat pumps, determines heating or cooling mode)

Bosch heat pumps use the O/B terminal to switch between heating and cooling. Some heat pumps energize O in cooling and B in heating. Others do the opposite. Ecobee thermostats allow you to select the correct setting during setup. This is a common point of confusion. If you are unsure, consult a professional HVAC technician. You can also refer to resources like [is my heat pump o or b](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-my-heat-pump-o-or-b).
