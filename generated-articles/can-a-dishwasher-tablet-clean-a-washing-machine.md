*   **Check Pockets:** Always check pockets before washing. Small items like coins, keys, or tissues can damage the drum. They can also clog the drain pump.
*   **Wipe Down and Air Out:** After each wash, wipe down the door seal and dispenser drawer. Leave the door (or lid for top-loaders) ajar. This allows the interior to dry completely. This is crucial for preventing mold and musty odors.

#### Identifying When Your Washing Machine Needs Cleaning

Recognizing the signs that your washing machine needs a clean is important. This prevents issues from escalating. Pay attention to these indicators:

*   **Unpleasant Odors:** The most obvious sign is a musty, moldy, or stale smell coming from the machine. This odor often transfers to your supposedly "clean" clothes. This is usually due to mold, mildew, or bacterial growth.
*   **Visible Grime and Residue:** Look for a slimy film on the rubber gasket or inside the detergent dispenser. You might see black spots of mold. You could also notice white, crusty mineral deposits.
*   **Clothes Don't Seem Clean:** If your laundry comes out with streaks, spots, or doesn't smell fresh, your machine might be the problem. A dirty machine cannot properly clean clothes.
*   **Longer Wash Cycles or Drainage Issues:** While less common for simple grime, severe buildup can affect performance. Clogged filters or hoses can lead to longer cycles or poor drainage.
*   **Excessive Suds:** If you notice unusually excessive suds during a cycle, even with the correct detergent amount, it can indicate a buildup of old detergent or fabric softener residue.

Addressing these signs promptly helps maintain your machine's efficiency. It also prevents more significant problems. Regular cleaning, whether with a dishwasher tablet or other methods, is part of this overall care strategy. Taking these steps ensures your washing machine remains a reliable part of your home for many years.
