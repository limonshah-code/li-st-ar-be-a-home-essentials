They might even turn your skin green. Knowing how to clean cheap jewelry is a game-changer. It helps you keep your accessories looking fresh and new.

In this guide, I will share simple, effective ways to clean and care for your budget-friendly bling. We will cover common materials and the best cleaning methods. You will learn how to remove tarnish, tackle discoloration, and protect your pieces for longer wear. Let's make your cheap jewelry sparkle again!

*   Clean your pieces regularly to maintain their shine.

To effectively clean cheap jewelry, gently wipe it with a soft cloth and a solution of mild dish soap and warm water. For stubborn grime or light tarnish, a soft brush can help. Always dry thoroughly to prevent moisture damage and preserve the finish.

### Understanding Cheap Jewelry Materials and Their Challenges

Cheap jewelry often uses different materials than fine jewelry. These materials make the pieces affordable. However, they also make them more prone to damage and tarnish. Understanding these materials helps you clean them correctly. I want to help you care for your items without causing harm.

Most cheap jewelry features base metals like brass, copper, or nickel. Manufacturers then apply a thin layer of gold, silver, or rhodium over these metals. This process is called plating. Plating can wear off over time. This exposes the base metal underneath. When the base metal reacts with air, moisture, or skin oils, it can tarnish. This tarnish often appears as dark spots or a green discoloration on your skin. Plastic, glass, and glued-on rhinestones are also common in cheap pieces. These materials need gentle care. Harsh cleaners can dissolve glue or scratch surfaces.

The biggest challenge with cheap jewelry is tarnish. Tarnish is a natural chemical reaction. It causes metals to look dull or dark. Sweat, perfumes, and lotions speed up this process. The thin plating on cheap jewelry offers little protection. It wears down quickly with regular use. Many pieces also have delicate elements like glued-on gems or painted details. These parts can easily get damaged by water or strong scrubbing. Knowing these challenges helps you choose the right cleaning method. It ensures your jewelry lasts longer and stays beautiful. When cleaning these items, remember their delicate nature.

Some cheap jewelry is also called "fake jewelry." You can learn more about how to clean various types of non-precious jewelry by reading our guide on [how to clean fake jewelry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-fake-jewelry). For items that are specifically plated, our article on [how to clean plated jewelry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-plated-jewelry) offers detailed advice.

### Essential Supplies for Cleaning Cheap Jewelry at Home

You do not need many special tools to clean cheap jewelry. Simple household items work best. Using the right supplies prevents damage. I always recommend gathering your materials before you start. This makes the cleaning process smooth and easy.

First, you need a mild liquid soap. Dish soap is perfect. Choose one that does not contain strong degreasers or harsh chemicals. These can strip the plating from your jewelry. Next, you need warm water. Make sure it is not too hot. Hot water can loosen glued parts. You will also need a soft cloth. Microfiber cloths work well. They are gentle and absorbent. Cotton balls or cotton swabs are good for small, hard-to-reach areas. A very soft-bristle toothbrush, like a baby toothbrush, can help. Use it gently for light scrubbing. Always avoid abrasive materials. Rough cloths or brushes can scratch surfaces. They can also remove thin plating.

I keep all my cleaning supplies in one small kit. This makes it easy to grab when a piece needs a quick refresh. Remember to have a separate, clean cloth ready for drying. Drying is a crucial step. It prevents water spots and moisture damage. Good ventilation is also helpful during the drying process. Make sure your workspace is clean. Protect it with a towel. This prevents any cleaning solutions from damaging your table. With these basic supplies, you are ready to start. You can clean most cheap jewelry items safely and effectively right from your home.

### General Methods for How to Clean Cheap Jewelry (The Basics)

Cleaning cheap jewelry is often simpler than you think. My go-to method uses just mild soap and water. This gentle approach works for most pieces. It removes dirt, oil, and light grime without causing harm. I use this method for my everyday earrings and necklaces.

#### Gentle Soap and Water Method

Start by filling a small bowl with warm water. Add a few drops of mild dish soap. Stir the water gently to mix the soap. Do not create too many suds. Place your jewelry into the soapy water. Let it soak for just a few minutes. Five minutes is usually enough. For very dirty items, you can let them soak up to ten minutes. After soaking, remove the jewelry from the water. Use a soft-bristle toothbrush or a cotton swab. Gently scrub away any dirt or grime. Pay attention to crevices and detailed areas. Be very gentle, especially around glued-on stones. You do not want to dislodge them.

After scrubbing, rinse the jewelry under cool, running water. Make sure all soap residue is gone. Soap left behind can dull the shine. I hold the piece carefully to ensure a complete rinse. Be careful not to drop small items down the drain. You can use a fine mesh strainer in the sink for safety. This method works well for many types of cheap jewelry. It brings back their sparkle without harsh chemicals. This basic cleaning routine is a fundamental step in maintaining your affordable accessories. For general cleaning of older items, you might find our guide on [how to clean old jewelry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-old-jewelry) helpful, as basic methods often overlap.

#### Drying Your Jewelry Properly

Proper drying is just as important as cleaning. Moisture can cause cheap jewelry to tarnish quickly. It can also weaken glue. After rinsing, place your jewelry on a clean, soft cloth. Gently pat it dry. Use a separate dry section of the cloth for each piece. Make sure to absorb all visible water. I often let pieces air dry for a bit longer. Place them on a dry cloth in a well-ventilated area. Do not put them in direct sunlight. Sunlight can cause some materials to fade.

For pieces with stones or intricate designs, use a cotton swab. Gently blot in and around the settings. This removes any trapped water. Small air blowers, like those used for cameras, can help. They push out moisture from tiny spaces. Never use a hairdryer on hot settings. High heat can damage delicate components. It can also cause plastic or resin to warp. Once your jewelry is completely dry, you can store it. Storing dry pieces prevents future tarnish. This simple drying step makes a big difference in jewelry longevity. It helps your cheap jewelry stay shiny and free from water damage.

### Tackling Tarnish and Discoloration on Cheap Jewelry

Tarnish is a common problem with cheap jewelry. It happens when metals react with air, moisture, or body oils. This reaction makes the metal look dull and dark. Sometimes, it leaves a green mark on your skin. I have dealt with plenty of tarnished pieces. Knowing how to remove tarnish safely is key.

For light tarnish, the mild soap and water method mentioned earlier often works. For more stubborn tarnish, you need a different approach. Remember, cheap jewelry has thin plating. You must be very gentle. Strong rubbing or abrasive cleaners will remove the plating. Once the plating is gone, the piece will tarnish even faster. It will also be harder to restore. My goal is always to preserve the thin layer that gives the jewelry its shine.

One gentle method involves baking soda. Make a thick paste by mixing baking soda with a tiny bit of water. Apply this paste to the tarnished areas with a soft cloth or cotton swab. Gently rub the paste onto the surface. Do not press hard. Rub in small, circular motions. After a minute or two, rinse the jewelry thoroughly under cool water. Ensure all baking soda is removed. Then, dry the piece completely with a soft cloth. Baking soda is a mild abrasive. It helps lift the tarnish without being too harsh. This method is effective for many types of base metal items.

Another option for specific metals might be white vinegar. You can dip a cotton swab in white vinegar. Gently wipe the tarnished area. Do not soak the entire piece, especially if it has glued parts or stones. Vinegar is acidic. It can react with some materials. Rinse immediately and dry completely. This method works well for removing green residue left on skin. Always test a small, hidden area first. This ensures the cleaner does not damage the finish.

### Specific Care for Different Types of Cheap Jewelry

Not all cheap jewelry is the same. Different materials need different cleaning approaches. Treating each type correctly helps maintain its beauty. I always assess the materials before I start cleaning. This prevents accidental damage.

#### Plated Metals

Plated jewelry is very common. It looks like gold, silver, or rose gold. The thin metal layer sits over a base metal. The key to cleaning plated jewelry is gentleness. Avoid anything abrasive. Strong cleaners or rough cloths can scratch the plating off. Once the plating is gone, the base metal shows through. This base metal often looks dull or tarnished. It can also turn your skin green. For plated items, use the mild soap and warm water method. Soak them for only a few minutes. Gently wipe with a soft microfiber cloth. Do not scrub hard. After cleaning, rinse well and dry thoroughly. Quick drying prevents water spots and helps preserve the plating. Always remember that a thin layer means less durability.

#### Rhinestones and Glued Elements

Many cheap jewelry pieces feature rhinestones or other glued-on decorations. These elements are delicate. Water and cleaning solutions can loosen the glue. This causes the stones to fall out. When cleaning these pieces, minimize moisture. Do not soak them. Instead, dampen a cotton swab with mild soapy water. Gently wipe around the rhinestones. Use a dry cotton swab to immediately absorb any excess moisture. For stubborn dirt around the settings, use a dry, soft brush. A dry, soft toothbrush can reach tiny crevices. Be very careful not to snag the settings. Drying immediately is crucial for these pieces. You want to avoid the glue getting wet. This approach keeps the stones secure and sparkling. If your cheap jewelry specifically contains rhinestones, you might find more detailed care tips in our guide on [how to clean rhinestone jewelry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-rhinestone-jewelry).

#### Plastic and Resin Jewelry

Plastic and resin are durable materials. They are also common in affordable jewelry. Cleaning these pieces is usually straightforward. They do not tarnish like metals. However, they can get dirty or scratched. Use mild soap and cool water. Soak them briefly if needed. Then, wipe with a soft cloth. You can gently scrub with a soft brush for textured surfaces. Rinse well and air dry or pat dry. Avoid hot water, which can warp some plastics. Also, avoid abrasive cleaners. These can scratch the surface. Scratches can make plastic or resin look dull. Keep these pieces away from strong chemicals like nail polish remover. Such chemicals can dissolve or damage the material. Simple care keeps these colorful pieces looking their best.

#### Wooden and Fabric Elements

Some cheap jewelry includes natural materials like wood or fabric. These elements need very specific care. They can absorb water. This can cause swelling, warping, or discoloration. Do not submerge these pieces in water. Instead, spot clean them. Use a lightly dampened cloth. Wipe the dirty areas gently. For fabric parts, a dry, soft brush can remove dust. You can also use a lint roller. If the fabric is stained, you might need a tiny drop of mild soap. Apply it with a cotton swab. Immediately blot with a clean, damp cloth. Then, let it air dry completely. Never use harsh cleaners on wood. They can strip finishes. Always ensure these materials are fully dry before storing. This prevents mold or mildew growth. Caring for these natural components helps preserve their look.

### Preventing Damage and Extending the Life of Your Cheap Jewelry

Cleaning your cheap jewelry is important. However, preventing damage is even better. Proper care can greatly extend the life of your affordable pieces. I have learned some simple habits that make a big difference. These habits keep your jewelry looking newer for longer.

First, think about when you wear your jewelry. Put on your jewelry last, after applying perfumes, lotions, and hairspray. These products contain chemicals. They can react with the metals and plating. This speeds up tarnish. For example, hairspray can leave a sticky film. This film attracts dirt. It also makes the metal dull. Let your skin absorb lotions and perfumes before adding your accessories. This small change protects your jewelry from chemical exposure. It keeps the surface clean and shiny.

Second, take off your jewelry before certain activities. Remove it before showering, swimming, or doing dishes. Water, especially chlorinated water, is very damaging to cheap metals. Soap scum and detergents also contribute to tarnish. Even washing your hands with rings on can cause problems. The chemicals in soaps can strip plating. They can also leave residue. Remove your jewelry before exercising. Sweat is acidic. It can accelerate corrosion on base metals. Taking off your jewelry during these times protects it from moisture and harsh chemicals. It prevents premature wear and discoloration.

Third, proper storage is crucial. Do not just toss your cheap jewelry into a pile. This can lead to tangles, scratches, and faster tarnishing. Air and moisture are the enemies of cheap metals. Store your pieces in individual bags or compartments. Small plastic zip-top bags work well. You can also use jewelry boxes with soft linings. For necklaces, hang them up to prevent tangles. Add anti-tarnish strips to your storage containers. These strips absorb moisture and chemicals. They significantly slow down the tarnishing process. Store jewelry in a cool, dry place. Avoid bathrooms. The humidity in bathrooms is bad for metal. Following these simple prevention tips helps your cheap jewelry last. You can enjoy your favorite pieces for a long time.

### When to Seek Professional Help (Or Know When to Let Go)

Most cheap jewelry issues can be fixed at home. My cleaning tips cover common problems like dirt and tarnish. However, some damage is beyond DIY repair. It is important to know when to seek professional help. Sometimes, it is also best to know when to let a piece go.

Cheap jewelry is not meant to last forever. Its low cost comes from using less durable materials. If the plating is completely worn off, home cleaning cannot restore its original look. Once the base metal is fully exposed, it will tarnish very quickly. Re-plating cheap jewelry is usually not cost-effective. The cost of professional re-plating often exceeds the original price of the item. In these cases, it might be time to replace the piece. Think of cheap jewelry as something to enjoy for a season or two.

If a piece has significant structural damage, like a broken clasp or a missing stone, a jeweler might be able to fix it. However, the repair cost for cheap jewelry can again be higher than buying a new item. Jewelers specialize in precious metals and stones. They might not have the right tools or materials for inexpensive costume pieces. They may also charge a minimum fee. This fee makes repairing a five-dollar necklace impractical. I suggest getting an estimate first. Compare the repair cost to the price of a new piece. This helps you make an informed decision.

There are also instances where a piece holds sentimental value. If a cheap piece is a gift or has special memories, repair might be worth the cost. In such cases, discuss the options with a trusted jeweler. Explain the sentimental value. They might offer a creative solution. Otherwise, for common wear and tear on cheap jewelry, DIY cleaning is your best bet. If that fails, it is usually more practical to buy a new, similar item. Knowing when to invest in repair versus replacement saves you time and money. It helps you manage your jewelry collection wisely.

### FAQ Section

#### Can I use toothpaste to clean cheap jewelry?

I do not recommend using toothpaste to clean cheap jewelry. Toothpaste can be too abrasive. It contains small gritty particles. These particles can scratch the surface of plated jewelry. They can also remove the thin metal layer. This exposes the base metal underneath. Stick to mild soap and water for safe cleaning.

#### Why does my cheap jewelry turn my skin green?

Cheap jewelry often turns skin green due to a reaction with copper. Many affordable pieces use copper or brass as a base metal. When these metals react with sweat, oils, or lotions, they oxidize. This oxidation creates a green residue. The green residue then transfers to your skin.

#### How often should I clean my cheap jewelry?

You should clean your cheap jewelry based on how often you wear it. For pieces worn daily, a quick wipe with a soft cloth after each wear is good. A deeper clean with mild soap and water every few weeks or once a month is usually sufficient. Clean less frequently worn items before storing them.

#### Can I shower with cheap jewelry?

No, I advise against showering with cheap jewelry. Water, especially with soap and shampoo, can accelerate tarnishing. It can also loosen glued components and dull the finish. Always remove your affordable jewelry before stepping into the shower or bath.

#### What's the best way to store cheap jewelry?

The best way to store cheap jewelry is in a cool, dry place. Keep pieces separate to prevent tangling and scratching. Small plastic zip-top bags are excellent for individual storage. You can also use jewelry boxes with soft compartments. Add anti-tarnish strips to absorb moisture and preserve shine.

#### Can cheap jewelry be re-plated?

Technically, cheap jewelry can be re-plated. However, it is usually not practical or cost-effective. The cost of professional re-plating often exceeds the original price of the item. It is typically more economical to purchase a new piece of jewelry instead.
