## Effortless Removal: How To Remove Panasonic Over The Range Microwave

Thinking about upgrading your kitchen or replacing an old appliance? Removing an over-the-range microwave can seem like a daunting task. However, with the right steps and safety measures, you can handle it yourself. This guide focuses specifically on how to remove your Panasonic over the range microwave safely and efficiently. I will walk you through each step. You will learn everything from preparation to the final uninstallation. Let's get your old microwave out and make room for something new.

### Takeaway

Removing a Panasonic over-the-range microwave involves several key steps:
*   Always disconnect power at the circuit breaker first.
*   Identify and detach the exhaust ventilation system.
*   Locate and remove the mounting screws from the cabinet above.
*   Carefully lift the microwave off its wall mounting plate.
*   Ensure you have a helper for safe handling and lowering of the unit.

To remove a Panasonic over the range microwave, first, shut off power at the circuit breaker. Then, disconnect the power cord and exhaust vent. Next, remove the screws holding the microwave to the upper cabinet. Finally, with a helper, lift the microwave off its wall mounting bracket and carefully lower it.

### Safety First: Preparing for Panasonic Microwave Removal

Before you even touch your microwave, safety is your top concern. Ignoring safety steps can lead to electrical shock or injury. I always begin by gathering the right tools. You will need a Philips head screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, work gloves, and safety glasses. I also recommend a stable step stool or ladder.

The most important safety step is to disconnect the power. Go to your home's main electrical panel. Locate the circuit breaker that controls the kitchen or the specific microwave outlet. Flip it to the "off" position. I always double-check the microwave to confirm it has no power. Try turning it on or checking its clock display. No power means you are ready for the next step.

Clear the area around the microwave. Remove any items from the stovetop below. Make sure your work area is free of clutter. This prevents accidental falls or damage. Have a helper available, especially for the heavy lifting part. Over-the-range microwaves are heavy and awkward to handle alone. A second person makes the removal process much safer and easier.

### Disconnecting Power and Exhaust Ventilation

Once the power is off, you can begin disconnecting the microwave itself. First, locate the power cord. It usually plugs into an outlet inside the upper cabinet above the microwave. Reach inside the cabinet and unplug the microwave's power cord from the wall outlet. This ensures no residual power issues.

Next, you need to address the ventilation system. Panasonic over-the-range microwaves can vent in different ways. Some models recirculate air back into the kitchen. Others vent outside through a duct. If your microwave vents outside, you will see a duct connection at the top or back. Carefully remove any screws or clamps holding this duct in place. You may need a screwdriver for this.

For models that recirculate, there might be a damper or no direct duct connection. You might see a vent opening at the top or front of the unit. This step is crucial for preventing damage to your home's ventilation system. It also ensures the microwave can slide free later. If your microwave is hardwired instead of plugged in, you will need to unscrew the junction box cover. Then, carefully disconnect the wires, making sure the power is definitely off. For more details on electrical connections, you can check guides on [can an over the range microwave be hardwired](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-an-over-the-range-microwave-be-hardwired). Also, this is a good time to inspect the grease filters, often found underneath the microwave. Learning [how to clean over the range microwave filters](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-over-the-range-microwave-filters) can be useful for maintenance or when installing a new unit.

### Locating and Removing Top Cabinet Fasteners

Over-the-range microwaves typically attach to the cabinet above them. This is usually done with two or three long bolts or screws. These fasteners secure the top of the microwave to the bottom of the cabinet. Open the upper cabinet doors directly above the microwave. Look for these screws. They often have large, flat heads or are machine screws. You will need your Philips head screwdriver, or sometimes a socket wrench.

Carefully unscrew each fastener. Make sure not to drop them inside the cabinet. Keep them in a safe place. These screws bear some of the microwave's weight, so the unit will feel less secure once they are removed. This is where your helper becomes essential. Once these top fasteners are out, the microwave will only be held by the wall mounting plate at the back. Be ready for the microwave to tilt forward slightly as you remove the last screw.

Understanding how these fasteners work is key to a smooth removal. It is the reverse process of installation. If you were thinking about how to put a new one in, the steps would be mirrored. You can often learn more about the mounting process by reviewing guides on [how to install over the range microwave with vent](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-over-the-range-microwave-with-vent). This gives you a complete picture of the securing method.

### Detaching from the Wall Mounting Plate

With the top screws removed and the power disconnected, your Panasonic microwave is now ready to be lifted off its wall mounting plate. The mounting plate is a metal bracket that screws directly into the wall studs. The bottom back of the microwave hooks onto this plate. This design supports the bulk of the microwave's weight. My personal experience is that this is the trickiest part. You need a good grip and careful coordination.

Stand on your sturdy step stool or ladder, facing the microwave. Have your helper stand ready beside you. You and your helper need to lift the microwave slightly. This lifts the bottom edge off the mounting plate's hooks. Then, pull the microwave unit away from the wall. You will need to pull it out towards you by about an inch or two. This disengages the hooks from the plate. Be ready for the weight.

Once disengaged, carefully lower the microwave. This requires synchronized effort with your helper. They can support the bottom as you guide the top. Ensure you do not scratch the stovetop or countertops below. This step requires strength and coordination. Removing an over-the-range microwave is similar across brands, so if you've seen how to remove a [Goldstar over the range microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-goldstar-over-the-range-microwave), the principles apply. Also, understanding different mounting scenarios, such as [how to mount over the range microwave without cabinet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-mount-over-the-range-microwave-without-cabinet), can provide additional context on how these units are typically supported.

### Safely Lowering and Transporting the Old Microwave

After detaching the Panasonic microwave from its mounting plate, the next critical step is to lower it safely. This is the moment where having a second person is truly invaluable. The microwave is heavy and awkward, so a team effort reduces the risk of injury or damage. I recommend coordinating your movements. One person supports the front, and the other supports the back or a side. Lift the microwave together.

Carefully bring the microwave down from the elevated position. You can place it on your kitchen floor, provided it is protected. I usually lay down a moving blanket or an old towel. This prevents scratches to the floor. Once it is on the floor, you can prepare it for transport. You might need to move it out of the kitchen. Consider its weight and size when planning its path out of your home.

When moving the microwave, lift with your legs, not your back. If possible, use a hand truck or appliance dolly for longer distances. This protects both you and your floors. Remember, your old microwave might still be quite useful. Or, it might be ready for disposal. Knowing [how to dispose of over the range microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-dispose-of-over-the-range-microwave) properly is important. Many communities have specific guidelines for appliance disposal.

### Post-Removal Cleanup and Preparation for New Installation

With your old Panasonic microwave successfully removed, it is time to clean up. This area under the cabinet and behind where the microwave sat can collect dust and grease over time. Use a degreaser and a damp cloth to wipe down the wall and cabinet surfaces. This creates a clean slate for your new appliance. I find this step very satisfying.

Check the electrical outlet and the vent opening. Ensure they are clean and free of debris. If you are installing a new microwave, make sure the electrical outlet is compatible. You should also ensure the vent opening matches the new unit's requirements. This preparation makes the new installation much smoother. Many homeowners find that installing a new over-the-range microwave is a direct reversal of the removal process.

If you plan to install a new over-the-range microwave, now is the time to verify its specifications. Ensure it fits the space and aligns with the existing wall mounting plate. Some new units come with their own mounting plates, which may require removing the old one. If you are ready for the next step, you can review details on [can I install an over the range microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-install-an-over-the-range-microwave). This ensures your kitchen upgrade continues seamlessly.
