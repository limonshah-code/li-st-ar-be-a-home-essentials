A Samsung dishwasher blinks and does not start when it detects an issue preventing safe or proper operation. This often indicates a specific error code related to power, door closure, water supply, drainage, or internal component malfunction, signaling that the appliance cannot proceed with its cycle.

### Understanding Samsung Dishwasher Error Codes and Blinking Lights

Your Samsung dishwasher uses blinking lights to tell you something is wrong. These lights are a built-in diagnostic system. They often point to a specific problem preventing the cycle from starting. Different blinking patterns or illuminated indicator lights usually correspond to error codes.

These codes are like a secret language for your appliance. They communicate what is happening inside. For example, a common issue might cause the "Normal" light to blink repeatedly. This could signal a water supply problem. Another pattern might indicate a door latch issue. Knowing these codes helps you identify the problem quickly.

Your dishwasher's user manual is your best friend here. It lists all possible error codes and their meanings. Look up the specific blinking pattern your dishwasher shows. This will give you a precise diagnosis. Some models even display numerical codes on a digital screen. This makes troubleshooting even easier.

Understanding these signals helps avoid guesswork. It directs you to the exact component needing attention. This saves time and effort during the repair process. Do not ignore these blinking lights. They are trying to help you. Other dishwashers, like LG and Bosch models, also use blinking lights to signal problems.

For example, you can learn more about how other brands use flashing lights to communicate errors by looking at resources like [Why Is My LG Dishwasher Flashing And Not Starting](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dishwasher-flashing-and-not-starting) or [Why Is My Bosch Dishwasher Flashing And Not Starting](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-bosch-dishwasher-flashing-and-not-starting).

When you see blinking lights, write down the pattern. Note which specific lights are active. Then, refer to your manual. This simple step is crucial for effective troubleshooting. It will guide your next actions.

### Checking Power Supply and Electrical Connections

A Samsung dishwasher needs a stable power supply to run. If your dishwasher is blinking and not starting, electrical issues are often the first thing to check. Sometimes, the problem is simpler than you think. A power interruption can cause the control board to act erratically.

First, try a soft reset. Unplug the dishwasher from its wall outlet. Wait about one to five minutes. Then, plug it back in firmly. This can clear minor glitches in the control system. It is similar to restarting your computer.

If a soft reset does not work, check your home's circuit breaker. Dishwashers are usually on a dedicated circuit. Find your main electrical panel. Look for a tripped breaker labeled "Dishwasher" or "Kitchen." It might be in the "off" position or in the middle. Flip it completely off, then firmly back to the "on" position. This restores power to the appliance.

Next, inspect the power cord itself. Make sure it is fully inserted into the wall outlet. Check for any visible damage, like cuts or frays. A damaged cord needs professional replacement. Also, ensure the outlet itself is working. You can test it by plugging in another small appliance, like a phone charger or a lamp. If the outlet has no power, the problem lies with your home's electrical wiring, not the dishwasher.

Loose electrical connections at the dishwasher's terminal block can also cause intermittent power issues. This check requires more technical skill and caution. Always disconnect power at the circuit breaker before opening any access panels. If you are unsure, call a qualified electrician. Resolving power issues is fundamental for any appliance. This includes problems with a dishwasher not turning on or even a dryer turning on but not starting. If you want to learn more about how power issues affect other appliances, resources like [Why Is My Samsung Dishwasher Not Turning On](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-not-turning-on) and [Why Is My Samsung Dryer Turning On But Not Starting](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dryer-turning-on-but-not-starting) can provide valuable insights.

Ensuring your Samsung dishwasher has a steady, correct power source is crucial. Many operational faults, including blinking and not starting, stem from simple power irregularities. Addressing these fundamental electrical checks first can save you time and money on unnecessary repairs.

### Issues with the Door Latch and Interlock Switch

The door latch on your Samsung dishwasher is a critical safety component. It ensures the door is securely closed before a cycle begins. If the dishwasher senses the door is not fully latched, it will often blink and refuse to start. This prevents water from spilling out during operation.

First, check the door closure itself. Push the dishwasher door firmly until you hear a solid click. Sometimes, dishes or silverware can obstruct the door from closing completely. Rearrange any items that might be in the way. Ensure nothing is sticking out of the racks.

Next, inspect the door latch mechanism. Look for any visible damage or debris. Food particles or detergent residue can build up in the latch. This prevents it from engaging properly. Clean the latch area with a damp cloth and a soft brush. Make sure the strike plate on the dishwasher tub is aligned with the latch on the door.

The door latch assembly contains an interlock switch. This switch sends a signal to the control board that the door is closed. If this switch is faulty or misaligned, the dishwasher will not start. Even if the door appears closed, the switch might not be registering it. You can often test the latch by trying to start a cycle while gently pushing on the door. If it starts, the latch is likely the problem.

A broken spring or a loose wire connection within the latch assembly can also cause issues. This usually requires replacing the door latch assembly. This is a common repair. Most appliance parts stores carry replacements. If you choose to replace it yourself, always disconnect power to the dishwasher first. Ensure safety throughout the process.

This simple component is vital for safe and reliable operation. A malfunctioning door latch or interlock switch will consistently prevent your Samsung dishwasher from starting. Addressing this component is a common and often effective solution.

### Water Supply Problems and Fill Valve Issues

Your Samsung dishwasher needs a steady supply of water to start and run a cycle. If it detects a problem with the water intake, it will often blink and refuse to start. This is a protective measure to prevent the machine from running dry. It also stops it from attempting to wash dishes without water.

First, check the water supply line. This is the hose that connects your dishwasher to the hot water pipe under your sink. Make sure the shut-off valve for the dishwasher's water supply is fully open. It might be a small handle or a knob. Sometimes, these valves can be accidentally turned off. Ensure there are no kinks or bends in the supply hose. A kink can restrict water flow significantly.

Next, inspect the water inlet screen. This small filter is usually located where the water supply hose connects to the dishwasher's inlet valve. Mineral deposits or debris can clog this screen over time. Disconnect the water supply hose from the dishwasher. Use pliers to gently pull out the screen. Clean it thoroughly under running water with a small brush. Reinstall it carefully.

The water inlet valve itself could be faulty. This valve opens to allow water into the dishwasher. If it is stuck closed, defective, or not receiving power, water will not enter the tub. You might hear a buzzing sound if it is trying to open but cannot. You can test the valve for continuity with a multimeter if you are comfortable with electrical testing. A faulty valve needs replacement. This usually requires calling a technician unless you have advanced DIY skills.

Low water pressure in your home can also be a culprit. If your household water pressure is too low, the dishwasher's sensor might not detect enough incoming water. This could prevent it from starting. Check your faucets to see if water pressure is generally low throughout your home. A clogged water filter in your home's main water line could be the cause. My Samsung dishwasher once had trouble starting and holding water in the bottom, which was a clear sign of a water system issue. This made me realize how important the water supply is to the dishwasher's operation. For more information on water retention issues, you might find it helpful to read [Why Is My Samsung Dishwasher Holding Water In The Bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-holding-water-in-the-bottom).

Ensuring proper water supply and a functioning fill valve is essential. Without adequate water, your Samsung dishwasher cannot perform its basic function. Addressing these components can often resolve the blinking and non-starting issue.

### Clogged Filters and Drain Line Blockages

Your Samsung dishwasher relies on clear filters and an unblocked drain line for proper operation. If water cannot enter or exit correctly, the machine detects a fault. This often leads to blinking lights and a refusal to start a cycle. The system protects itself from overflowing or burning out.

First, clean the dishwasher filter. Most Samsung dishwashers have a removable filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. It usually consists of a cylindrical filter and a flat filter screen. Refer to your owner's manual for exact instructions on how to access and remove them. Food particles, grease, and debris can accumulate in these filters. This restricts water flow and can cause poor washing performance or error codes. Rinse the filters under running water. Use a soft brush to remove stubborn grime. This is a routine maintenance task. For specific instructions on where to find and clean the filter, refer to resources like [Where Is Filter In Samsung Dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-filter-in-samsung-dishwasher).

Next, inspect the drain hose for blockages or kinks. The drain hose typically connects the dishwasher to your kitchen sink drain or garbage disposal. Look for any visible kinks or tight bends in the hose. Straighten them out if found. Food debris can get stuck inside the hose, creating a clog. You might need to disconnect the hose from both ends to thoroughly check for blockages. Use a long, flexible brush or snake to clear any obstructions.

Also, check the air gap if your kitchen sink has one. The air gap prevents dirty drain water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It is usually a small chrome cylinder on your sink counter. Remove its cover and check for any debris. Clean it out if necessary. If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, ensure the disposal is clear. Run it for a few seconds to clear any food waste.

A common symptom of drainage issues is standing water in the bottom of the dishwasher. If your Samsung dishwasher is holding water, it likely has a drainage problem, which can prevent new cycles from starting. This is another reason your machine might blink and not start. For more information, you can check out [Why Is My Samsung Dishwasher Holding Water In The Bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-holding-water-in-the-bottom). Regular cleaning of filters and ensuring clear drain lines are simple steps. They greatly contribute to your dishwasher's smooth operation. Addressing these points often resolves blinking issues.

### Malfunctioning Control Board or User Interface

When your Samsung dishwasher is blinking and not starting, and you have ruled out the simpler issues, the problem might lie with the control board or user interface. These are the "brains" of your appliance. They manage all functions and interpret sensor signals. A malfunction here can lead to unpredictable behavior, including error lights and a complete refusal to operate.

The control board (also known as the main PCB) is responsible for executing wash cycles, controlling water flow, and managing heating elements. If this board develops a fault, it can send incorrect signals. It might fail to receive signals from sensors. This causes the dishwasher to halt and display an error. Power surges or age can damage circuit components on the board. You might notice unusual behavior before a complete shutdown. This includes cycles stopping midway or lights flickering randomly. Sometimes, a full power reset can temporarily clear minor software glitches. This involves unplugging the dishwasher for several minutes.

The user interface, or control panel, is where you select cycles and options. It communicates your commands to the main control board. Buttons might become unresponsive or display erratic lights if the interface is faulty. Water damage or worn-out buttons can cause issues. If only certain buttons work, or if the lights on the panel are blinking seemingly without pattern, the user interface might be the culprit. A replacement of the user interface might be necessary.

Diagnosing a faulty control board or user interface can be challenging. They are expensive parts. Replacing them often requires disassembling part of the dishwasher. It is crucial to get an accurate diagnosis before replacing these components. A professional technician can use diagnostic tools to confirm the fault. They can tell you if it is the control board or the user interface. Replacing these parts is usually not a DIY task for most homeowners.

Sometimes, a faulty control board can cause a Samsung dishwasher to turn on by itself, running programs without user input. This symptom strongly points to a control board issue. If you have experienced this, it further supports the idea of a malfunctioning board. If you've encountered such issues, learning about these symptoms can be useful. Check out [Why Is My Samsung Dishwasher Turning On By Itself](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-turning-on-by-itself) for more details. If you suspect either the control board or the user interface is at fault, professional assistance is usually recommended. This ensures proper diagnosis and safe replacement.

### Sensor Failures and Other Internal Components

Samsung dishwashers use various sensors to monitor conditions inside the tub. These sensors ensure safe and efficient operation. If one of these sensors fails, it can send incorrect data to the control board. This often causes the dishwasher to blink and stop functioning. The machine acts this way to prevent damage or unsafe conditions.

One important sensor is the turbidity sensor. This sensor detects how dirty the water is. It helps the dishwasher determine the wash cycle length and water usage. If this sensor malfunctions, the dishwasher might not know how dirty the dishes are. It might then refuse to start, as it cannot properly plan the wash. Cleaning the sensor can sometimes fix issues. It is usually located near the drain filter at the bottom of the tub.

Another critical component is the water level sensor, or float switch. This sensor ensures the dishwasher fills with the correct amount of water. If it gets stuck or fails, the dishwasher might overfill or underfill. Both scenarios will cause the machine to stop and blink an error. Check the float switch for any obstructions. It is typically a small plastic component in the bottom of the tub that moves up and down.

The heating element and its associated thermostat or sensor also play a role. If the dishwasher detects an issue with heating, it might not start. This prevents potential overheating or poor cleaning results. Issues with the heating element could also be linked to the thermistor, which measures water temperature. If the thermistor is faulty, it can send wrong temperature readings. This makes the dishwasher think something is wrong.

Problems with the circulation pump or drain pump can also trigger errors. If the circulation pump cannot spray water effectively, or the drain pump cannot remove water, the dishwasher will stop. These components are essential for the wash and drain cycles. A blinking light can indicate a pump issue. Listen for unusual noises, like humming or grinding, which can signal a struggling pump.

Diagnosing these sensor or component failures often requires specialized knowledge and tools. Accessing these parts means disassembling the dishwasher. Testing them involves using a multimeter to check for continuity or correct resistance. If you have systematically checked the simpler issues and your Samsung dishwasher is still blinking, a sensor or internal component failure is a strong possibility. In such cases, contacting a qualified appliance technician is the safest and most efficient next step. They can accurately diagnose and replace the faulty part, getting your dishwasher back in working order.
