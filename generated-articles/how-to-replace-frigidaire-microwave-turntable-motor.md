### Accessing the Turntable Motor in Your Frigidaire Microwave

Accessing the turntable motor requires opening your Frigidaire microwave's outer casing. This part of the repair demands patience and a systematic approach. Do not rush this step. Proper disassembly prevents damage to other components.

First, remove the turntable plate and roller ring from inside the microwave. These parts simply lift out. Set them aside in a safe place. Next, locate the screws that hold the microwave's outer casing. These screws are typically on the back, sides, or top of the unit. Some models might have screws hidden under rubber feet or plastic caps. Use your Phillips head screwdriver to remove all visible screws. Keep the screws organized. You can use a small container or tape them to a piece of paper in the order you remove them. This helps during reassembly.

Once all screws are out, carefully slide or lift the outer cover. Some covers slide backward, then lift. Others lift straight up. Be gentle. The cover might catch on wires or edges. Take care not to scratch the finish. After removing the outer cover, you will see the internal components. The turntable motor sits at the very bottom of the microwave cavity. It is usually under the floor panel of the cooking compartment. This motor is a small, cylindrical component. It has a shaft that protrudes upward into the microwave cavity. This shaft connects to the turntable's coupling.

You might need to remove a metal or plastic plate from the bottom interior. This plate often covers the motor and its wiring. It might be held by a few more screws or tabs. Once this plate is gone, the motor becomes fully visible. Take a moment to observe how the motor connects and its wire orientation. This helps you during reassembly. This step moves you closer to replacing your Frigidaire microwave turntable motor. For other Frigidaire microwave repairs, like replacing a fuse, different access points might be needed, as detailed in guides like [how to replace fuse in Frigidaire microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-fuse-in-frigidaire-microwave).

### Removing the Old Frigidaire Turntable Motor

With the motor accessible, you can now remove the faulty component. This step involves disconnecting wires and detaching the motor itself. Take pictures with your phone before disconnecting anything. These photos serve as a valuable reference during installation.

The turntable motor has electrical wires connected to it. These wires usually plug into a connector or are held by spade terminals. Carefully pull the wires from their connection points. Use needle-nose pliers if they are stiff. Note the color of each wire and its connection spot. Some motors have two wires, others might have three or four. Ensure you remember which wire goes where. If the connections are spade terminals, gently pull them off. Avoid pulling on the wires themselves. This might damage the insulation or break the wire.

Next, locate the mounting screws that secure the motor. The motor is typically held in place by two or three screws. These screws might be small and recessed. Use the correct size Phillips head screwdriver for removal. Some motors are held by clips or a twist-lock mechanism instead of screws. Observe carefully how the old motor sits in its housing. Once the screws are out, the motor should lift out freely. If it feels stuck, double-check for any hidden clips or additional fasteners.

Sometimes, the motor shaft connects to a plastic coupling that extends into the microwave cavity. This coupling might stay with the old motor or remain inside the microwave. If it stays in the microwave, remove it as well. You will attach the new motor to a new coupling or re-use the old one if it is in good condition. Inspect the area for any debris or signs of wear.
