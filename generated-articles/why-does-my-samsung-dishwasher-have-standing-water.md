**Why does my Samsung dishwasher have standing water?**
Your Samsung dishwasher has standing water typically due to a drainage obstruction or a faulty drain component. Common culprits include a clogged filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, a malfunctioning drain pump, or issues with the air gap or garbage disposal connection. Addressing these issues often restores proper drainage.

### Understanding Why Your Samsung Dishwasher Has Standing Water

When you open your Samsung dishwasher and see standing water at the bottom, it signals a drainage problem. This water should drain completely after each wash cycle. If it does not, it means water cannot exit the machine properly. This issue impacts cleaning performance and creates an unsanitary environment inside the appliance.

Several components work together to drain water from your dishwasher. If any one of these parts malfunctions or gets blocked, standing water appears. We will cover the most frequent reasons for this issue. We also provide clear steps you can take to diagnose and fix them. Knowing what causes the problem helps you address it efficiently.

This guide focuses specifically on Samsung models. However, many troubleshooting steps apply to other dishwasher brands as well. Standing water in a dishwasher is a universal symptom of drainage failure.

### Clogged Filter: A Common Culprit for Standing Water

One of the most common reasons a Samsung dishwasher has standing water is a clogged filter. The filter traps food particles and debris during the wash cycle. If you do not clean it regularly, these particles build up. This buildup prevents water from flowing freely into the drain pump.

A dirty filter restricts the outflow of water. This leads to water accumulating at the bottom of the tub. Over time, this standing water can also develop an unpleasant odor. Most Samsung dishwashers have a self-cleaning filter system or a manual filter you need to clean. [Finding the filter in your Samsung dishwasher is a simple process](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-filter-in-samsung-dishwasher) and regular cleaning is crucial maintenance.

To check your filter:

*   Locate the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It usually consists of a cylindrical fine mesh filter and a coarser filter plate.
*   Twist or lift the filter components to remove them.
*   Rinse them thoroughly under running water to remove all food debris. Use a soft brush if needed.
*   Reinstall the filters correctly, ensuring they lock into place.

Regular filter cleaning prevents many drainage issues. I personally clean my dishwasher filter once a month to avoid this problem. Neglecting this simple task often causes unexpected standing water.

### Blocked Drain Hose: Impeding Water Flow

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your home's drainage system. This system can be a garbage disposal or a dedicated drain pipe. If this hose becomes kinked, blocked, or improperly installed, water cannot escape. This results in standing water in the bottom of your Samsung dishwasher.

Kinks are common if the dishwasher was recently moved or installed. They restrict water flow like a pinched garden hose. Internal blockages can occur from food debris or grease that passes through the filter. Over time, these can build up inside the hose. An improper drain hose connection can also cause issues. The hose should loop high to prevent backflow from the sink drain. This is called a "high loop."

To inspect your drain hose:

*   Unplug the dishwasher from its power source for safety.
*   Locate the drain hose, which usually connects to the back of the dishwasher and then to your sink's drain pipe or garbage disposal.
*   Check the entire length of the hose for any visible kinks or bends. Straighten any you find.
*   Disconnect the hose from the sink or disposal side. Place the end into a bucket.
*   Run a short drain cycle to see if water flows out. If it does not, the blockage is likely in the hose itself or inside the dishwasher.
*   If you suspect a blockage, carefully remove the hose from both ends. Clear any debris using a long brush or by flushing it with water.

Ensure the high loop is present when reinstalling the hose. This prevents dirty water from your sink backing up into the dishwasher. A blocked drain hose is a frequent cause of a Samsung dishwasher holding water in the bottom. This is a common issue seen in various dishwasher brands, such as when your [GE dishwasher has standing water after a cycle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-dishwasher-have-standing-water-after-the-cycle).

### Faulty Drain Pump: The Heart of the Drainage System

The drain pump is a critical component that forcefully expels water from the dishwasher. It activates at specific points in the cycle to remove dirty water. If the drain pump malfunctions, water will not be pushed out. This leaves standing water in the bottom of your Samsung dishwasher.

A faulty drain pump can manifest in several ways. It might make unusual buzzing or grinding noises, or it might make no sound at all during the drain cycle. Sometimes, small objects like broken glass or food debris can get lodged in the pump impeller. This prevents it from spinning freely. Other times, the motor itself fails due to electrical issues or wear and tear.

To check the drain pump:

*   First, disconnect power to the dishwasher.
*   Remove the lower spray arm and filter assembly to access the pump area.
*   Look for any visible obstructions around the impeller, which is the fan-like part of the pump. Use gloves and carefully remove any debris.
*   If no obstructions are found, the pump itself might be faulty. This requires professional diagnosis or replacement. You might hear the pump humming but not draining, which suggests an obstruction or weak motor.

Replacing a drain pump can be a more involved repair. If you are not comfortable with appliance repairs, I suggest calling a qualified technician. Sometimes, issues like [a Samsung dishwasher not getting water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-not-getting-water) can also stem from pump-related problems, though that is usually the circulation pump rather than the drain pump.

### Issues with the Air Gap or Garbage Disposal Connection

Your dishwasher's drainage system might connect to an air gap or directly to a garbage disposal. Problems with either of these connections can prevent proper drainage. An air gap is a small cylindrical fitting on your sink counter. It prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If the air gap gets clogged, water will back up into the dishwasher.

A garbage disposal unit that is not fully clear can also block dishwasher drainage. The dishwasher drain hose often connects to a dedicated inlet on the disposal. If this inlet plug was not removed during disposal installation, or if the disposal is clogged with food, water cannot drain. This is a very common issue many people overlook.

To check these components:

*   **Air Gap:**
    *   Remove the cap from the air gap on your sink.
    *   Check for any debris or blockages inside. You might see slimy residue or food particles.
    *   Clean it out thoroughly.
    *   Also, check the hoses connected to the air gap for clogs.

*   **Garbage Disposal:**
    *   Ensure your garbage disposal is clear and running properly. Run it with plenty of water.
    *   If the dishwasher was recently installed or the disposal is new, verify that the knockout plug inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet was removed. This plug is a small piece of plastic designed to prevent leaks before the dishwasher is connected. It must be punched out.
    *   Disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Check for any blockages where the hose connects.
    *   Run the disposal for a few seconds to clear any standing water in it.

Addressing air gap or garbage disposal issues often provides a quick fix for standing water. It's a good step to take before delving into internal dishwasher components. These external connections are easy to overlook but critical for drainage.

### Malfunctioning Drain Check Valve: Preventing Backflow

The drain check valve is a small, one-way valve located near the drain pump. Its purpose is to prevent water from flowing back into the dishwasher tub after it has been drained. If this valve gets stuck open, clogged with debris, or simply fails, dirty water can re-enter the dishwasher. This leaves standing water at the bottom, even after the drain cycle completes.

Debris like food particles, grease, or even small pieces of broken glass can cause the check valve to stick open. Over time, the valve's rubber flapper or spring mechanism can also wear out. This prevents it from sealing properly. A non-functioning check valve allows water that has already been pumped out to siphon back into the dishwasher from the drain hose or sink.

To inspect the drain check valve:

*   First, disconnect the power to your Samsung dishwasher.
*   You will usually find the check valve near the drain pump assembly. It might be accessible from inside the tub by removing the filter and lower spray arm. In some models, you might need to access it from the underside of the dishwasher.
*   Once located, examine the valve for any visible obstructions.
*   Gently test the flapper or mechanism to see if it moves freely and seals properly.
*   Clean any debris you find. If the valve appears damaged or does not seal, it likely needs replacement.

A faulty check valve is a less common cause of standing water. However, it is an important component to check if other drainage issues have been ruled out. This is a specific issue that [causes a Bosch dishwasher to keep filling up with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-bosch-dishwasher-keep-filling-up-with-water) and is common across many brands.

### Overfill or Water Supply Problems Causing Standing Water

Sometimes, standing water results from too much water entering the dishwasher, not just drainage failure. This can happen due to a malfunctioning water inlet valve or a faulty float switch. The water inlet valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. If it sticks open, it can continuously fill the tub.

The float switch is a safety device designed to detect when the water level is too high. It triggers the drain pump and shuts off the water inlet valve to prevent overflow. If the float switch is stuck in the "down" position or is defective, the dishwasher might overfill without detecting it. This leads to standing water. A common symptom of this type of issue on Samsung models is a "water over level error" which [you can troubleshoot for your Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-samsung-dishwasher-over-level-water-error).

To check these components:

*   **Water Inlet Valve:** Listen for a continuous filling sound even when the dishwasher is off. If you hear it, the valve might be stuck open. This usually requires replacement.
*   **Float Switch:**
    *   Locate the float switch at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, typically under the lower spray arm. It looks like a small plastic cup or cylinder that floats up with the water level.
    *   Manually push the float up and down to ensure it moves freely.
    *   Check for any debris underneath the float that might be preventing it from moving.
    *   If the float moves freely, but the dishwasher still overfills, the switch itself might be faulty and needs testing with a multimeter or replacement.

These issues are less about drainage and more about water control. However, they result in the same symptom: standing water. It's crucial to identify the source of the water to apply the correct fix. This type of problem is similar to what happens when [a Whirlpool dishwasher fills with water but does not wash](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-fill-with-water-but-not-wash), though that can also indicate a circulation pump failure.

### Electrical or Control Board Issues Affecting Drainage

Modern Samsung dishwashers rely on complex electrical systems and a central control board. These components manage all cycles, including the drain cycle. If there's an electrical issue or a problem with the control board, the dishwasher might not initiate the drain pump. This leaves water standing in the tub.

A malfunctioning control board can send incorrect signals or fail to send any signals to the drain pump. This prevents the pump from activating. Electrical issues like loose wiring or a tripped circuit breaker can also cut power to the pump. Sometimes, this can even affect the dishwasher's ability to turn on at all. For example, [if your Samsung dishwasher is not turning on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dishwasher-not-turning-on), a drainage issue could be a symptom of a larger electrical problem.

Diagnosing electrical or control board issues is more challenging and often requires a multimeter and electrical knowledge.

*   **Check Circuit Breaker:** First, check your home's electrical panel. Ensure the circuit breaker for the dishwasher hasn't tripped. Reset it if necessary.
*   **Inspect Wiring:** Visually inspect any accessible wiring connected to the drain pump and control board for signs of damage or loose connections. *Always disconnect power before doing this.*
*   **Control Board:** A faulty control board might display error codes. Consult your Samsung dishwasher's user manual to interpret any codes shown on the display. These codes often point to specific component failures.

If you suspect an electrical or control board problem, it is often best to call a qualified appliance technician. These repairs can be dangerous if attempted without proper training. Faulty control boards are an infrequent cause of standing water. However, they are important to consider if all other mechanical issues have been ruled out.

### Professional Help: When to Call an Expert

While many standing water issues in Samsung dishwashers are DIY-friendly, some problems require professional assistance. If you have systematically checked all the common culprits—clogged filters, drain hoses, air gaps, and garbage disposals—and the problem persists, it might be time to call a technician. Issues like a truly failed drain pump, a malfunctioning control board, or complex internal leaks often need expert attention.

Don't hesitate to seek professional help when safety is a concern. Working with electricity and water can be dangerous without proper knowledge. A qualified appliance repair technician has the tools, experience, and diagnostic equipment to quickly pinpoint the problem. They can also access replacement parts that may not be readily available to the average homeowner.

Before calling, have your Samsung dishwasher model number ready. Describe the symptoms clearly to the technician. This helps them prepare for the repair. While a service call costs money, it ensures the repair is done correctly and safely. It also prevents further damage to your appliance. Sometimes, investing in professional repair saves you money and stress in the long run.

Ultimately, your goal is to get your dishwasher running smoothly again. If you've tried everything within your comfort level and expertise, there's no shame in calling a pro. It's often the quickest path to a fully functional, standing water-free Samsung dishwasher. My personal experience shows that some problems are just too complex for a DIY fix.
