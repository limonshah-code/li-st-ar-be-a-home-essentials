## Current Status of Gas Stove Sales Across New York State

Many people ask about buying gas stoves in New York. Currently, you can still purchase gas stoves from appliance retailers throughout New York State. This includes large chain stores and smaller local shops. The recent statewide law focuses on new building construction, not on sales for existing homes. If your home already has a gas line, you can replace your old gas stove with a new one. This situation provides a window for consumers who prefer cooking with gas.

The New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) sets ambitious climate goals. Part of this act includes the All-Electric Building Law. This law aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It does this by requiring new buildings to use electric power for heating and cooking. This means new homes built after specific dates cannot have gas stoves installed. However, the law does not prevent you from buying a gas stove for your current home. Nor does it force you to remove an existing gas stove.

This distinction is important for homeowners. It means your existing kitchen setup is largely unaffected by the new state law. You retain the choice to use gas for cooking, at least for now. The focus remains on new construction. This approach allows a gradual transition. It avoids immediate disruption for current homeowners. Future regulations could change this, but present laws protect your existing gas appliance use.

### Understanding the All-Electric Building Law's Phased Approach

New York's All-Electric Building Law implements changes in stages. This phased approach provides time for the construction industry to adapt. It also allows consumers to understand the new rules.

Larger new buildings, those seven stories or more, face the ban on January 1, 2029. These dates apply statewide.

The law includes some exemptions. Critical infrastructure facilities, hospitals, and certain commercial kitchens are exempt. Manufacturing facilities and laundromats also receive exemptions. This ensures essential services can continue to operate using gas if necessary. These exemptions acknowledge specific operational needs. They prevent undue hardship on vital sectors.

This timeline means that any new home constructed after these dates will not have a gas
