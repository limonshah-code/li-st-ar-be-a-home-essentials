### Clear Answer to Main Query:

To BBQ grill corn, prepare the cobs by husking, soaking, or wrapping in foil. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place corn directly on grates, in husks, or in foil packets. Cook, turning occasionally, until kernels are tender and slightly charred, typically 15-25 minutes depending on the method.

## Choosing and Preparing Corn for Your BBQ Grill

Picking the right corn is the first step to delicious grilled corn. You want fresh, sweet corn for the best taste. Look for ears with bright green husks that are still tightly wrapped. The silk should be damp and a little sticky, not dry or black.

### Selecting the Freshest Corn

Feel the ears for plump kernels all the way to the tip. Avoid corn with dry husks or any signs of mold. Gently peel back a small part of the husk if you can. This lets you check the kernels. They should be firm and milky when you press them.

### Cleaning Corn for Grilling

Once you have your fresh corn, you need to clean it. The cleaning method depends on how you plan to grill it. For grilling in the husk, you only need to remove loose outer leaves. If you plan to grill shucked corn, you must remove all husks and silk.

My preferred way to clean corn is simple. First, pull back the husks to expose the kernels. Then, use a damp paper towel to wipe away the silk. You can also use a stiff brush. Ensure all silk strands are gone for a clean eating experience. If you want more details, check out my guide on [how to clean corn](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-corn).

## Grilling Corn in the Husk: A Traditional Method

Grilling corn in its husk is a classic and simple method. This technique lets the corn steam inside its natural wrapper. The husks protect the kernels from drying out and add a subtle smoky flavor. It is a great way to keep corn moist and tender.

### Preparing Corn in the Husk

Start by carefully peeling back the outer layers of the husk. Do not remove them completely. Pull them down to the base of the cob. Remove all the silk strands. This step ensures you do not have to deal with stringy silk after cooking. Once the silk is gone, pull the husks back up to cover the kernels.

Some people like to soak the corn in water before grilling. Soaking for about 15-30 minutes helps prevent the husks from burning too quickly. It also adds moisture, creating a steaming effect. I often skip soaking if I am short on time, and it still turns out great.

### Grilling Process for Husk-On Corn

Preheat your BBQ grill to medium-high heat. Place the corn directly on the grill grates. Cook for about 15-20 minutes. Make sure to turn the ears every 4-5 minutes. You want the husks to char evenly on all sides.

The husks will look blackened and crispy. This is a good sign. The corn inside will be sweet and tender. When done, carefully peel back the hot husks. You can use tongs or wear grilling gloves. The steam inside will be hot, so be careful. Serve it immediately with butter and salt. This method yields a naturally sweet and juicy cob.

## Grilling Corn Without the Husk: Direct Char and Flavor

Grilling corn without the husk allows for direct contact with the flames. This method creates a beautiful char and intensifies the corn's natural sweetness. It is perfect for those who love a smoky, slightly crispy texture. I often use this method when I want a bold, rustic flavor.

### Shucking and Seasoning Naked Corn

First, completely remove all husks and silk from the corn. This means you will have "naked" corn cobs ready for the grill. Once shucked, I like to brush the corn lightly with olive oil. This helps prevent sticking and promotes even browning. You can also use melted butter.

Next, season the corn generously. A simple sprinkle of salt and black pepper is always good. Some people like to add a dash of chili powder or paprika for a kick. Make sure to coat all sides of the cob. This enhances the flavor as it cooks directly over the heat.

### Direct Grilling Technique

Preheat your BBQ grill to medium-high heat, about 400-450째F (200-230째C). Place the shucked and seasoned corn directly onto the clean grill grates. Keep the lid closed as much as possible to maintain consistent heat. This helps cook the corn thoroughly.

Cook the corn for 10-15 minutes. Turn the cobs every few minutes to ensure even cooking and charring on all sides. You are looking for bright yellow kernels with some dark, smoky spots. These charred bits add incredible flavor. The corn should be tender when pierced with a fork. This direct method gives you that classic grilled flavor many people love. For optimal grill performance and easy cleaning after direct grilling, it's a good idea to know [how to clean BBQ grills](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bbq-grills). Keeping your grates clean prevents sticking and ensures even heat distribution for your next batch of corn.

## Mastering the Art of Foil-Wrapped Grilled Corn

Grilling corn wrapped in foil is a fantastic method for tender, moist, and flavorful results. This technique steams the corn in its own juices and any added seasonings. It is perfect for those who prefer a less charred, more buttery cob. My kids always ask for corn cooked this way.

### Preparing Corn for Foil Wrapping

Start by completely shucking the corn, removing all husks and silk. Once the corn is clean, you can get creative with your seasonings. I like to spread a thin layer of butter over each cob. You can use plain butter or compound butter with herbs like chives or parsley. A sprinkle of salt and pepper is a must.

For added flavor, consider adding a slice of lime, a pinch of garlic powder, or a few fresh herb sprigs. Place each seasoned cob onto a large piece of aluminum foil. Make sure the foil is big enough to fully wrap the corn.

### Wrapping and Grilling in Foil

Carefully wrap each ear of corn tightly in the aluminum foil. You want to create a sealed packet. This prevents steam from escaping and keeps all the delicious flavors locked inside. Make sure there are no open seams.

Preheat your BBQ grill to medium heat, around 350-400째F (175-200째C). Place the foil-wrapped corn packets directly on the grill
