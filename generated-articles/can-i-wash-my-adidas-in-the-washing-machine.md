### Can I Wash My Adidas in the Washing Machine?

Yes, you can often wash your Adidas in the washing machine. However, specific models and materials need careful attention. Always use a delicate cycle with cold water and air dry them to prevent damage. Not all Adidas shoes are suitable for this method.

## Understanding Your Adidas: Can All Models Be Machine Washed?

Not every pair of Adidas shoes is the same. Some are perfectly fine for machine washing, while others are not. The material of your Adidas shoes is the main factor. Different materials react differently to water and agitation. Knowing your shoe's construction helps prevent damage.

Most Adidas sneakers made from mesh, Primeknit, or canvas are good candidates. These materials are durable and can handle a gentle wash cycle. However, Adidas shoes with leather, suede, or delicate embellishments should not go in the washing machine. Water can damage these materials easily. Leather can crack, and suede can shrink or get stiff. Always check the care label inside your shoe if possible. This label often gives specific cleaning instructions.

For specific models like Adidas Gazelles, extra caution is needed. Gazelles often feature suede or leather accents. These materials are prone to water damage. Machine washing them can ruin their texture and shape. Instead, spot cleaning is usually the best approach for such shoes. If you own Gazelles, you might find our article on [can I put Adidas Gazelles in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-put-adidas-gazelles-in-the-washing-machine) very helpful. Understanding your shoe's specific design helps you make the best cleaning choice.

## Preparing Your Adidas for the Washing Machine

Proper preparation makes a big difference when washing shoes. Taking a few simple steps ensures your Adidas come out cleaner. It also helps protect your shoes from damage. Skipping these steps can lead to poor results or even ruined sneakers.

First, remove the laces from your Adidas shoes. The laces can get tangled or frayed in the wash. You can wash them separately by hand or place them in a small mesh bag. Next, take out the insoles. Insoles often hold a lot of odor and moisture. Washing them separately helps them dry faster and prevents trapped moisture inside the shoe. You can usually hand wash insoles with a mild soap.

After removing laces and insoles, tackle any loose dirt. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush to scrub away mud and debris. You can also rinse off heavy dirt under a faucet. This step prevents dirt from spreading in the washing machine. For tougher stains, pre-treat them with a mild stain remover. Apply the remover directly to the stain and let it sit for a few minutes. This process helps the washing machine do a better job. You can find more detailed pre-cleaning tips in our article on [how to clean Adidas shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-adidas-shoes).

Finally, place your Adidas shoes in a mesh laundry bag. This bag protects your shoes from bumping around inside the machine. It also protects your washing machine from hard shoe parts. Use one bag per pair of shoes for best results. This simple step is vital for a safe and effective wash.

## Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings for Adidas

Selecting the correct washing machine settings is critical. The wrong settings can shrink your shoes or damage their materials. You want a gentle wash that cleans effectively without harsh treatment. Always prioritize the shoe's safety over quick cleaning.

First, always use cold water. Hot water can cause shoes to shrink or materials to warp. It can also loosen the adhesives that hold your shoes together. Cold water is much gentler on fabrics and glues. It still cleans well, especially when combined with a good detergent. Many modern washing machines have a "cold wash" setting.

Next, choose a delicate or gentle cycle. These cycles use less agitation and spin slowly. They mimic hand washing more closely. Intense cycles can bang shoes around, potentially tearing fabric or deforming the shape. Some machines have a "hand wash" or "sports shoes" setting, which is also ideal. Avoid heavy-duty cycles at all costs.

Use a mild liquid detergent. Powder detergents might leave residues on your shoes. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach, especially on colored shoes. A small amount of detergent is usually enough. Too much detergent can be hard to rinse out. For specific washing machines, like an LG model, understanding the right settings is key.

To balance the load, add a few old towels to the washing machine. This helps cushion the shoes. It prevents them from hitting the drum too hard during the wash cycle. The towels also help distribute the load, making the machine work more efficiently. This step is a small but effective way to protect your Adidas.

## Drying Your Adidas Shoes Safely After Washing

Drying your Adidas shoes correctly is just as important as washing them. Incorrect drying methods can cause irreversible damage. Heat is the biggest enemy of athletic shoes. It can deform materials, crack adhesives, and change the shoe's shape. Always be patient and choose the safest drying method.

The only safe way to dry your Adidas shoes is by air drying. Remove them from the washing machine immediately after the cycle ends. Place them in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat sources. A cool, dry room or outdoors on a breezy day is ideal. Direct sunlight can fade colors and weaken materials over time. Avoid putting them near heaters, radiators, or in a clothes dryer. The high heat from these sources will damage your shoes.

To help your Adidas shoes maintain their shape, stuff them with paper towels or old newspapers. Crumple the paper and push it gently inside the shoes. This absorbs extra moisture and helps the shoes keep their form as they dry. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes too damp. This speeds up the drying process. Make sure to remove any remaining water from inside the shoes.

Drying time will vary based on shoe material and humidity levels. It can take anywhere from 12 hours to a few days for shoes to dry completely. Do not wear your Adidas until they are fully dry. Wearing damp shoes can lead to unpleasant odors and mildew growth. Ensure the inside of the shoe is completely dry before reinserting the insoles and laces. This patience pays off with fresh, long-lasting shoes.

## Tips for Different Adidas Shoe Materials

Adidas shoes come in many materials. Each material needs specific care, especially when considering machine washing. Knowing these differences helps protect your investment. Some materials handle the washing machine well, while others require a gentler touch.

### Mesh and Primeknit Adidas

Many popular Adidas models, like UltraBoost and NMDs, use mesh or Primeknit uppers. These materials are generally machine-wash friendly. They are durable, breathable, and dry relatively quickly. When washing these, follow the general guidelines: cold water, delicate cycle, and a laundry bag. These materials resist shrinking and hold their shape well. The open weave of mesh and Primeknit allows water and detergent to clean effectively. They are excellent candidates for refreshing in the machine.

### Canvas Adidas Shoes

Canvas Adidas shoes, like some Gazelles or campus models, also fare well in the washing machine. Canvas is a sturdy cotton fabric. It can withstand water and mild agitation. For canvas shoes, follow the same cold water, delicate cycle instructions. You might notice some minor fading over time with repeated machine washes. This is normal for canvas materials. Air drying is crucial to prevent stiffening or shrinking. Canvas shoes are a good choice for machine washing when they get dirty.

### Leather and Suede Adidas Shoes

Leather and suede Adidas shoes are a different story. These materials should almost never go in a washing machine. Water can severely damage them. Leather can dry out, crack, and become stiff. Suede can shrink, lose its soft texture, and develop permanent water stains. For these materials, spot cleaning is the best method. Use specialized leather or suede cleaners. Apply them with a soft brush or cloth. Gently rub away dirt and stains. Follow the product instructions carefully. Never submerge leather or suede shoes in water. For those with white Adidas, especially those with mixed materials, special care might be needed.

## Maintaining Your Adidas: Extending Shoe Life

Keeping your Adidas shoes clean is not just about washing them. Regular maintenance extends their life. It prevents deep stains and excessive wear. Small actions consistently can make a big difference. This means your favorite pair will look great for much longer.

Regular spot cleaning is your first line of defense. Do not wait for your shoes to get completely dirty. If you see a small smudge or a bit of mud, clean it right away. Use a damp cloth with a mild soap. Gently wipe the affected area. This stops stains from setting in. Quick action saves you from more intensive cleaning later.

Consider using protective sprays on your Adidas shoes. Many brands offer water and stain repellent sprays. Apply these sprays to clean shoes. They create a barrier against dirt and moisture. This makes future cleaning easier. Always follow the product instructions for application and reapplication. These sprays are especially helpful for suede or canvas shoes.

Proper storage also helps maintain shoe quality. Store your Adidas in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. Keep them away from damp areas where mildew can grow. Using shoe trees helps them keep their shape. If you store them for a long time, clean them thoroughly first. This preparation prevents odors and material breakdown.

Finally, avoid over-washing your shoes. Even if your Adidas are machine washable, frequent washing can cause wear. The agitation, even on a delicate cycle, can stress materials and adhesives. Only wash your shoes when they are truly dirty. For light dirt, a simple brush off or spot clean is often enough. These consistent habits ensure your Adidas stay in top condition.
