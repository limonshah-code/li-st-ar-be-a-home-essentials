Manually turn the impeller to check for free movement. Finally, use a multimeter to test for electrical continuity and correct resistance across the pump's terminals.

## Understanding Your LG Dishwasher's Drainage System

Your LG dishwasher uses a drain pump to remove water. This pump pulls water from the wash tub and pushes it through the drain hose. The water then goes into your sink drain or garbage disposal. This process is vital for clean dishes. If the pump fails, water stays in the dishwasher.

Many signs point to a failing drain pump. The most obvious sign is standing water at the bottom of the tub. You might also hear a humming noise but no water draining. Sometimes, the dishwasher makes no draining sound at all. If your dishwasher does not drain, the pump might be broken or clogged. It is important to know that several issues can stop your dishwasher from draining. You can learn more about this by reading [when dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/when-dishwasher-does-not-drain).

Understanding these signs helps you act fast. A faulty drain pump can lead to odors and poor cleaning performance. It is a critical part of your dishwasher's function. We need to identify if the pump is indeed the problem before taking action. Knowing how the system works helps with proper testing.

## Safety First: Preparing for Dishwasher Diagnostics

Working with appliances needs caution. Electrical shock or water damage can happen. Safety must be your top priority before you begin. Always unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet. This cuts off all power to the appliance. Do not skip this step.

Next, turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. There is usually a shut-off valve under the sink. Turn it clockwise until it stops. This prevents water from flowing into the unit. You will need a few tools for this job. Gather them before you start.

Here is a list of tools you will need:
*   **Multimeter:** For electrical testing.
*   **Screwdriver set:** Phillips and flathead types.
*   **Pliers:** To loosen hose clamps.
*   **Towels or rags:** To clean up any spilled water.
*   **Shallow pan or wet/dry vacuum:** To collect standing water.
*   **Work gloves:** To protect your hands.

Having these tools ready makes the process smoother. It also ensures you can complete the testing safely. Always keep your work area dry and clear. Taking these precautions protects you and your home.

## Locating the LG Dishwasher Drain Pump

Finding the drain pump on your LG dishwasher is the next step. Most LG dishwasher drain pumps are at the bottom of the unit. They are often behind the kickplate. The kickplate is the panel at the very bottom front of the dishwasher. It hides the components underneath.

You will need to pull the dishwasher out from its space to access it. Sometimes, you can access the pump by removing only the kickplate. Each LG model might be slightly different. Refer to your owner's manual for specific instructions. The manual can show diagrams of your model’s internal parts.

Here are general steps to locate the pump:
1.  **Disconnect power and water supply:** As we discussed, safety first.
2.  **Remove the kickplate:** Use a screwdriver to remove the screws holding the kickplate. Set the screws aside.
3.  **Check underneath:** Look under the dishwasher. You should see various hoses and electrical wires.
4.  **Identify the pump:** The drain pump is a motor with a housing, typically connected to the drain hose. It sits low in the unit. It often looks like a small motor with a plastic body.

Once you find the pump, you can begin the inspection process. If your dishwasher is hardwired, you may need to turn off the circuit breaker. This cuts power at the breaker box. Always double-check power is off before touching any wires.

## Visual and Manual Inspection of the Drain Pump

After locating the drain pump, perform a visual check. Look for any clear signs of damage. Check the pump housing for cracks or leaks. A leaking pump means it needs replacement. Also, inspect the wires connected to the pump. Ensure they are not frayed or loose. Loose connections can prevent the pump from working.

The most common problem with a drain pump is a clog. Debris like food particles, broken glass, or small objects can get stuck. These items block the impeller, which is the spinning part of the pump. A blocked impeller stops water from moving out. To check for clogs, you might need to remove the drain hose from the pump. Also, check the filter and other drain components. You can learn how to effectively [clean dishwasher filter and drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-and-drain) to prevent blockages.

Once you clear any visible debris, try a manual test. The impeller is inside the pump housing. You might see it if you look closely or remove a small cover. Try to spin the impeller with your finger or a small tool. It should spin freely without resistance. If it feels stiff or does not move, it is likely jammed or broken. Clearing a clogged pump can often solve drainage problems. Sometimes, [cleaning the dishwasher pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-pump) itself can resolve issues. This manual check helps rule out simple blockages.

## Electrical Testing the LG Drain Pump with a Multimeter

Electrical testing confirms if the pump motor is faulty. You will need a multimeter for this step. A multimeter measures electrical properties like resistance and continuity. This test determines if the pump motor has an open circuit or internal damage. Make sure the dishwasher is still unplugged.

First, set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. This measures resistance. Disconnect the electrical connectors from the drain pump. Touch one probe from the multimeter to each terminal on the pump motor. You should get a reading within a specific range. For most LG dishwasher drain pumps, the resistance typically falls between 10 to 20 ohms. If the reading is zero or shows "OL" (open loop/infinite resistance), the pump is faulty. A reading of "OL" means there is a break in the internal wiring. This shows the motor cannot complete a circuit.

Next, test for continuity. Keep the multimeter on the ohms or continuity setting (it often beeps for continuity). Touch one probe to a pump terminal and the other probe to the pump's metal casing (ground). You should get no reading or infinite resistance. If you get a reading, it means the pump is shorted to ground. This is also a sign of a bad pump. For more details on expected readings, you can reference general guidelines like [how many ohms should a dishwasher drain pump have](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-many-ohms-should-a-dishwasher-drain-pump-have). Electrical tests are accurate ways to pinpoint internal pump failures.

## Checking Power Supply to the LG Drain Pump

Even if your drain pump tests fine, the problem might be elsewhere. The pump needs power to operate. You can check if the pump receives power. This step requires the dishwasher to be plugged in and a wash cycle active. Be extremely careful when dealing with live electricity. Use insulated tools and do not touch any bare wires.

Set your multimeter to the AC voltage (V~) setting. Locate the wires that connect to the drain pump. With the dishwasher running a drain cycle, place the probes of the multimeter onto the two wires that power the pump. You should get a reading close to 120 volts AC. If you get 120 volts, and the pump did not run, then the pump is bad. If you get no voltage, the problem lies upstream.

No voltage indicates an issue with the wiring harness or the main control board. The control board sends power to the pump at the right time. A faulty control board might not send the signal. This means the pump never receives the power it needs. In such cases, replacing the pump will not fix the issue. You will need to diagnose the control board or wiring. If you are not comfortable with live electrical testing, call a professional. Ensuring the pump gets power is as important as the pump itself working.

## Troubleshooting Beyond the Pump: Other Drainage Issues

Sometimes, the drain pump is not the cause of the problem. Other components can prevent your LG dishwasher from draining. It is important to check these possibilities before replacing the pump. A common issue is a clogged drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the pump to your house drain. If it bends or clogs, water cannot pass. You can try to clear a clogged hose. Learn more about how to [replace LG dishwasher drain hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-dishwasher-drain-hose) if it is damaged.

Another common problem is a clogged air gap. If your dishwasher has an air gap, it is usually on the countertop. It prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Debris can block it. You can often clear it by removing its cap and cleaning inside. The main house drain can also be the problem. If your sink drains slowly, the dishwasher might also struggle. This indicates a clog in the main plumbing. You might need to clear your sink drain.

Here are some other potential drainage issues:
*   **Garbage Disposal Clog:** If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, ensure the disposal is clear. Run the disposal for a minute.
*   **High Loop:** The drain hose needs a high loop to prevent backflow. If this loop is missing or incorrect, water might not drain.
*   **Sump Area Clog:** Debris can accumulate in the sump area beneath the filter. This area needs regular cleaning.
*   **Faulty Check Valve:** Some dishwashers have a check valve to prevent water from flowing back into the tub. If this valve sticks, it prevents draining.

Remember, a dishwasher that does not drain is a common complaint. Many general troubleshooting steps exist.
