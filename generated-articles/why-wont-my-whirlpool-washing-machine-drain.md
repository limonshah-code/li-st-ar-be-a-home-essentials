### Takeaway

When your Whirlpool washing machine won't drain, common causes include:
*   A clogged drain pump filter or drain hose.
*   A faulty drain pump.
*   Issues with the lid switch or door latch.
*   Problems with the water level sensor or control board.
*   Improper installation or power issues.

### Clear Answer

Your Whirlpool washing machine will not drain often due to a clogged drain pump filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, or a malfunctioning drain pump. Other reasons include a defective lid switch, issues with the control board, or problems with the water level sensor. Identifying the specific cause involves checking these components in a systematic way.

## Understanding the Whirlpool Washing Machine Drain Cycle

Your Whirlpool washing machine completes several stages during a wash. The drain cycle is a critical step. Water fills the tub. Clothes tumble clean. Then, the dirty water must leave the machine. The drain pump pushes this water out. It travels through a drain hose. The hose connects to your home's drainage system. If any part of this system fails, water remains. You will find the tub full. This affects the rinse and spin cycles. The machine stops working correctly. Understanding this process helps identify problems. You can pinpoint where the blockage or fault lies. This knowledge makes troubleshooting easier. It saves you time and frustration. A proper drain cycle ensures clean clothes.

The washing machine's control board manages the drain function. It sends a signal to the drain pump. The pump then activates. It uses an impeller to force water out. The water flows through the drain hose. This hose typically leads to a standpipe or utility sink. A filter often protects the pump. This filter catches lint and debris. Over time, this filter can clog. The pump also has a motor. This motor can fail. The hose can kink or get blocked. All these parts must work together. If one part fails, your Whirlpool washing machine won't drain. Knowing this system helps you fix it.

## Common Culprits: Clogged Drain Pump Filter

One frequent reason your Whirlpool washing machine won't drain is a clogged drain pump filter. This filter protects the drain pump. It catches small items. Coins, lint, buttons, or even socks can get stuck. Over time, debris builds up. This blocks water flow. The pump tries to push water. The blockage prevents it. The machine then cannot empty the tub. You might hear the pump motor running. No water moves. This is a clear sign of a clogged filter. Cleaning this filter is a simple DIY task. You do not need special tools. This often solves the problem quickly.

**How to Check and Clean the Filter:**

1.  **Safety First:** Unplug your Whirlpool washing machine from the power outlet. This prevents electric shock. Turn off the water supply too.
2.  **Access the Filter:** The drain pump filter is usually near the bottom front of the machine. It might be behind a small access panel. Some models have it behind the kick plate. Consult your owner's manual for exact location.
3.  **Prepare for Water:** Place towels on the floor. Use a shallow pan or bucket. There will be residual water.
4.  **Open the Filter:** Unscrew or unclip the filter cover. Water will spill out. Allow it to drain into your pan.
5.  **Clean the Filter:** Pull out the filter. Remove all lint, coins, and debris. Use a brush if needed. Rinse the filter under running water.
6.  **Check the Pump Impeller:** Look inside the filter housing. Ensure nothing is blocking the pump's impeller. A flashlight can help.
7.  **Reassemble:** Screw the filter back in tightly. Close the access panel. Plug in the machine. Restore water supply.
8.  **Test:** Run a short drain or spin cycle. See if the machine drains.

This step is crucial. It often resolves drainage issues. If your Whirlpool washing machine still won't drain, proceed to the next checks. A clean filter ensures smooth operation.

## Inspecting the Drain Hose for Blocks or Kinks

The drain hose is another common cause when your Whirlpool washing machine won't drain. This hose carries water away. It runs from the back of your washer. It connects to a standpipe or laundry sink. The hose can easily get kinked. Moving the machine can cause kinks. Heavy laundry loads can shift it. A kink stops water flow. This acts like a dam. Water cannot pass through. The machine cannot empty the tub. The hose can also become clogged internally. Lint, soap residue, or small items build up over time. This narrows the hose. It restricts water flow.

**Steps to Check the Drain Hose:**

1.  **Unplug the Machine:** Always disconnect power first.
2.  **Locate the Hose:** Find the large corrugated hose at the back of your washer.
3.  **Check for Kinks:** Visually inspect the entire length of the hose. Look for any sharp bends or crimps. Straighten any kinks you find. Pull the machine out from the wall slightly if needed.
4.  **Check for Blockages:**
    *   Disconnect the hose from the standpipe or sink.
    *   Lower the hose into a bucket. See if any water drains out. This indicates if the blockage is within the hose or further down.
    *   Use a flashlight to look inside the hose.
    *   If you suspect a blockage, use a plumber's snake or a long brush. Push it through the hose. Clear any obstructions.
    *   You might need to detach the hose from the machine's back. This provides a better angle. Be careful doing this. Water will spill out.
5.  **Check the Standpipe/Sink Drain:** Ensure the house drain itself is not clogged. Pour a bucket of water down the standpipe. If it drains slowly, your household plumbing might be the issue.
6.  **Proper Height:** Ensure the drain hose is at the correct height. Most Whirlpool washing machines require the hose end to be between 30 and 96 inches from the floor. If it's too low, it can siphon water. If too high, the pump struggles. Refer to your manual.

Replacing a severely kinked or damaged hose is often the best solution. A new hose ensures proper drainage. Understanding [how to change a Whirlpool washing machine drain pipe](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-whirlpool-washing-machine-drain-pipe) can be helpful if replacement is necessary.

## Investigating the Drain Pump: When It's the Root Cause

If your Whirlpool washing machine still won't drain after checking the filter and hose, the drain pump itself might be faulty. The pump is the heart of the draining system. Its job is to force water out. If the pump motor burns out, or the impeller breaks, it cannot perform this task. You might hear a humming noise but no water movement. Or, you might hear nothing at all when the drain cycle should activate. This indicates a problem with the pump's electrical supply or its internal components. A faulty drain pump needs replacement. This is a more complex repair than cleaning a filter.

**Signs of a Faulty Drain Pump:**

*   **No Noise:** During the drain cycle, you hear no sound from the pump.
*   **Humming Noise:** You hear a humming sound, but water does not drain. This suggests the motor tries to run but is seized or blocked.
*   **Burning Smell:** A burning smell often indicates a motor overheating.
*   **Error Codes:** Your machine might display an error code related to drainage. Consult your manual for code meanings.

**Testing and Replacing the Drain Pump:**

1.  **Safety First:** Unplug the washing machine. Turn off water.
2.  **Access the Pump:** The drain pump is usually at the bottom of the machine. You might need to tilt the washer back or remove a front panel. Again, consult your manual for exact location and access instructions.
3.  **Inspect Visually:** Check for any obvious damage. Look for loose wires.
4.  **Check for Obstructions:** Even if the filter is clean, something might be stuck directly in the pump's impeller blades. Reach in carefully and clear any debris.
5.  **Test Electrical Continuity (Advanced):** If you have a multimeter, you can test the pump for electrical continuity. This determines if the motor receives power. If it has continuity and power, but still doesn't spin, the motor is likely bad.
6.  **Replace the Pump:** If the pump is faulty, replacement is necessary. This involves disconnecting wires and hoses. Then you unmount the old pump. Install the new pump. Reconnect everything. Ensure all connections are secure and leak-free. This can be a challenging task. Some people might prefer professional help for this. The process for replacing a drain pump is similar across many brands, for example, learning [how to replace a GE washing machine drain pump](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-ge-washing-machine-drain-pump) can give you an idea of the steps involved.

A new drain pump will restore drainage function. This can extend the life of your Whirlpool washer.

## Exploring Electrical Issues and Control Board Failures

When your Whirlpool washing machine won't drain, the problem might not be mechanical. It could be electrical. The machine's control board is its brain. It sends signals to all components. This includes the drain pump. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the signal. The pump won't activate. This means no drainage. Power supply issues can also cause problems. A loose wire or a tripped circuit breaker prevents operation. A faulty lid switch or door latch is another common electrical culprit. The machine often won't drain if it thinks the door is open. This is a safety feature.

**Common Electrical and Control Issues:**

*   **Lid Switch/Door Latch:** Many washers will not spin or drain if the lid is open. If the lid switch is faulty, the machine might think the lid is open even when it is closed. This prevents the drain cycle. You can often test a lid switch with a multimeter. Replacing a lid switch is usually straightforward.
*   **Power Supply:** Check the power outlet. Ensure the machine is plugged in firmly. Check your home's circuit breaker. A tripped breaker will cut power. Reset it if it is off.
*   **Wiring:** Look for any visible loose or damaged wires. Especially check connections to the drain pump and control board.
*   **Control Board (Main Control Unit):** A faulty control board can prevent many functions. This includes draining. If other functions are also failing, or error codes point to the control board, it might be the issue. Testing a control board is complex. Replacement is often required. This is a costly part. Professionals usually handle control board replacements.
*   **Motor Control Board:** Some advanced Whirlpool models have a separate motor control board. This board governs the motor's functions, including drain pump operation. A fault here could prevent draining.

Diagnosing electrical issues requires caution. Always unplug the machine before inspecting wires. If you are not comfortable with electrical testing, call a qualified technician. While Whirlpool specific issues are important, many electrical problems are universal. For instance, sometimes a washing machine will not drain if it has no power at all, and you might wonder [will a washing machine drain if turned off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-a-washing-machine-drain-if-turned-off). Understanding basic power principles can help.

## Water Level Sensor and Pressure Switch Problems

The water level sensor, or pressure switch, plays a key role in your Whirlpool washing machine's operation. This component detects how much water is in the tub. It tells the control board when the tub is full. It also tells the machine when the water has drained. If this sensor malfunctions, it might incorrectly believe the tub is still full. Even after the pump has finished its job. Or, it might think the tub is empty when it is actually full. This confusion stops the drain cycle from proceeding. The machine might get stuck. It waits for a signal that never comes or is incorrect.

**How the Water Level Sensor Works:**

A small air trap tube connects the bottom of the tub to the pressure switch. As water fills the tub, it traps air in this tube. The trapped air creates pressure. This pressure activates the switch. The switch then sends a signal to the control board. If the tube is blocked, kinked, or leaky, the pressure reading will be wrong. This leads to drainage issues. The machine might overfill or fail to drain completely. Similarly, if the switch itself fails, it sends bad information.

**Troubleshooting the Water Level Sensor:**

1.  **Safety First:** Disconnect your washing machine from power.
2.  **Locate the Sensor:** The pressure switch is usually located behind the control panel or near the top of the machine. A thin, clear, or black rubber tube runs from it down to the tub.
3.  **Inspect the Air Tube:**
    *   Carefully disconnect the air tube from the pressure switch.
    *   Inspect it for kinks, clogs, or cracks.
    *   Blow through the tube. You should hear air bubbling in the tub. If not, the tube might be blocked. You can try to clear it.
    *   Ensure the tube is securely attached at both ends.
4.  **Test the Pressure Switch (Advanced):** If you have a multimeter, you can test the continuity of the pressure switch contacts. This requires knowing which terminals to test. Refer to your Whirlpool service manual.
5.  **Replace the Sensor:** If the tube is clear and the switch tests faulty, replacing the water level sensor is necessary. This involves disconnecting the tube and electrical wires. Then you install the new sensor.

A correctly functioning water level sensor ensures accurate water management. It allows your Whirlpool washing machine to complete its cycles properly. Sometimes, issues related to water level can also affect filling, such as when your [Whirlpool washing machine won't fill up with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-washing-machine-fill-up-with-water).

## Beyond Basics: Motor, Belt, and Other Mechanical Failures

While clogs and pump issues are common, other mechanical failures can prevent your Whirlpool washing machine from draining. The motor powers the drain pump. If the motor itself fails or has issues, the pump will not run. Some washing machines use a belt to transfer power from the motor to the pump. If this belt breaks or slips, the pump won't operate. These issues are less frequent but can happen. They often require more advanced repair skills.

**Motor Issues:**

*   **Motor Overload:** If the motor overheats, it might shut down. This can happen with continuous heavy use.
*   **Motor Failure:** Bearings can seize, or windings can burn out. If the motor fails, the pump won't get power. You might hear no sound at all.
*   **Capacitor Failure:** The motor often uses a start capacitor. If this capacitor fails, the motor might hum but not start.

**Belt Issues (for models with belts):**

*   **Broken Belt:** A broken belt means no power transmission. The pump will not spin.
*   **Slipping Belt:** A worn or loose belt can slip. The pump might run slowly or intermittently. This causes poor draining.
*   **Off-Kilter Belt:** The belt might come off its pulley. This also stops power transfer.

**Other Mechanical Considerations:**

*   **Pulley Issues:** A loose or damaged pulley on the motor or pump can prevent proper operation.
*   **Shock Absorbers/Suspension:** While not directly related to draining, if the machine is severely off-balance due to failing suspension, it might not complete cycles. Modern machines have sensors that stop operation for safety.
*   **Main Bearing:** A seized main bearing can put too much strain on the motor. This can prevent proper spinning and draining.

**Diagnosis and Repair:**

1.  **Safety First:** Always unplug the machine before attempting any inspection.
2.  **Access Components:** You will likely need to remove the back panel or lift the top of the machine. This varies by model.
3.  **Visual Inspection:** Look at the motor, belt, and pulleys. Check for visible damage, wear, or disconnections.
4.  **Manual Test:** For belt-driven systems, try to manually spin the pump's pulley. It should turn freely.
5.  **Professional Help:** Motor and belt replacements can be intricate. If you are unsure, it is best to call a qualified appliance technician. They have the tools and expertise to diagnose and fix these problems safely.
