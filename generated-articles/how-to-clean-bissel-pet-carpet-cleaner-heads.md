## Clean Your Bissell Pet Cleaner Heads for Best Results

Is your Bissell pet carpet cleaner not performing as well as it used to? Dirty cleaner heads are often the culprit. Pet hair, dirt, and grime build up over time, reducing suction and spreading odors. Learning how to clean Bissell pet carpet cleaner heads properly helps restore your machine's efficiency. This guide will walk you through the entire process. We will cover tool gathering, disassembly, deep cleaning, and reassembly. Get ready to give your Bissell the fresh start it deserves.

### Takeaway: Restore Your Bissell's Performance

*   **Gather Tools:** Collect screwdrivers, scissors, brushes, towels, and a cleaning solution.
*   **Safety First:** Always unplug the cleaner before starting any cleaning or disassembly.
*   **Disassemble Carefully:** Follow your model's instructions for removing the brush roll and nozzle cover.
*   **Deep Clean Components:** Remove all entangled hair, rinse brushes thoroughly, and clear any clogs.
*   **Clean Tanks and Housing:** Empty and wash both water tanks and wipe down the machine's exterior.
*   **Reassemble Correctly:** Ensure all parts are dry and securely reattached before use.
*   **Maintain Regularly:** Clean heads after each heavy use to prevent future buildup and odors.

Cleaning Bissell pet carpet cleaner heads involves careful disassembly, thorough removal of hair and debris from the brush roll and suction nozzles, and washing all removable parts with warm soapy water. Dry everything completely before reassembling to maintain optimal cleaning power and prevent unpleasant odors.

### Why Cleaning Your Bissell Pet Carpet Cleaner Heads Matters

Your Bissell pet carpet cleaner works hard to keep your home fresh. Over time, its cleaning heads accumulate pet hair, dirt, and cleaning solution residue. This buildup significantly reduces your machine's effectiveness. I learned this the hard way when my cleaner started leaving streaks on the carpet. Regular cleaning ensures your Bissell performs at its best. It helps prevent future problems.

Dirty cleaner heads can cause several issues. First, pet hair and debris tangle around the brush roll. This prevents it from spinning correctly or agitating the carpet fibers. The result is less effective dirt removal. Second, clogs in the suction nozzles reduce water flow and dirty water pickup. This leaves your carpets wetter and dirtier. Third, leftover pet dander and moist debris create unpleasant odors. This transfers the smell back onto your freshly cleaned carpets.

Maintaining your Bissell pet carpet cleaner heads extends the machine's life. It also keeps your carpets truly clean. Imagine spreading clean water with a brush covered in old dirt and pet hair. It defeats the purpose of cleaning. Proper maintenance means less frustration and better results. It also saves you money on potential repairs. Understanding [what is pet carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-pet-carpet) helps you appreciate the specific challenges your cleaner faces. When you do not clean the heads, you might also find yourself asking [how do you get pet smell out of carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-you-get-pet-smell-out-of-carpet) more often. Many people wonder [should I get a carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/should-i-get-a-carpet-cleaner) in the first place. If you have pets, it is a great tool, but only if you maintain it.

### Gathering Your Tools and Safety First

Before you start to clean Bissell pet carpet cleaner heads, you need the right tools. Having everything ready saves time and makes the process smooth. I always lay out my tools on a clean towel. This helps me keep track of everything. You likely have most of these items around your house already.

Safety is paramount when working with any appliance. Always unplug your Bissell carpet cleaner from the power outlet. This prevents accidental startup and reduces the risk of electrical shock. Wear gloves to protect your hands from dirt, pet hair, and cleaning solutions. Some parts can have sharp edges, so handle them with care.

Here is a list of the tools you will need:

*   **Screwdrivers:** You might need both Phillips-head and flat-head screwdrivers. Check your specific Bissell model for required tools.
*   **Scissors or a utility knife:** These are essential for cutting tangled hair and fibers from the brush roll.
*   **Stiff-bristled brush or old toothbrush:** This helps scrub away stubborn dirt and grime from small crevices.
*   **Microfiber towels or old rags:** Use these for wiping down parts and drying everything thoroughly.
*   **Bucket or large sink:** Needed for rinsing components.
*   **Warm water and mild soap:** A gentle cleaning solution for washing parts. You can use standard dish soap. If you are curious about solutions, consider [what to put in carpet cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-to-put-in-carpet-cleaner). Sometimes, a specific cleaner like [which carpet cleaner solution for pet urine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/which-carpet-cleaner-solution-for-pet-urine) can also be used for cleaning machine parts if diluted.
*   **Paper clips or thin wire:** Useful for clearing stubborn clogs in nozzles.

Make sure you have a well-lit area to work in. This helps you see all the small details and ensures a thorough clean. Taking a moment to prepare means you can focus on the cleaning task ahead.

### Disassembling Your Bissell Pet Carpet Cleaner Heads

Disassembling your Bissell cleaner head is a crucial step. It allows you to access all the areas where dirt and pet hair hide. The exact steps can vary slightly between Bissell models. However, the general process remains similar. Always refer to your user manual for model-specific instructions. My cleaner's manual helped me avoid breaking any small clips.

Start by placing your cleaner on a flat, stable surface. Ensure it is unplugged. Empty both the clean and dirty water tanks first. This makes the machine lighter and easier to handle. Next, you need to access the brush roll. This is typically located at the bottom of the cleaner head.

#### Locating the Brush Roll Cover

Most Bissell pet carpet cleaners have a removable cover over the brush roll. This cover protects the brush and directs the suction. Look for release latches or screws holding this cover in place. Some models have simple clips you can unlatch. Others require a screwdriver to remove a few screws. Take note of where each screw goes. It helps with reassembly.

Once you unlatch or unscrew the cover, gently pull it away. It might feel a bit stiff if it has not been removed before. Be careful not to force it. Check for any wires or hoses that might be attached. Some models have them, some do not. Remove the cover and set it aside. This gives you full access to the brush roll itself.

#### Removing Screws and Latches

Many Bissell models have screws that secure the brush roll or its housing. Use the correct screwdriver for these. Place the screws in a small container so you do not lose them. Some brush rolls simply lift out once the cover is off. Other models have small end caps or bearings that need to be removed first. Gently twist or pull these off.

Once the brush roll is free, lift it out of its compartment. It will likely be covered in tangled pet hair, fibers, and dirt. This is normal. You are now ready to clean it thoroughly. Remember how each part fits together. Taking a quick photo with your phone can be helpful. This acts as a reference for when you put everything back. Learning [how to use Bissell ProHeat Pet Carpet Cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-bissell-proheat-pet-carpet-cleaner) often involves understanding these parts. You can also explore [how to clean Vax Dual Power Pet Carpet Cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-vax-dual-power-pet-carpet-cleaner) for similar disassembly insights if you have multiple cleaners. The principles of disassembly are universal across many brands.

### Deep Cleaning the Brush Roll and Nozzles

This is where the magic happens. The brush roll and suction nozzles are the parts that get the most contaminated. They are responsible for lifting dirt and pet hair from your carpets. I often find a surprising amount of hair wrapped around the brush. This section will guide you through getting them spotless.

#### Removing Entangled Pet Hair

The first step is to remove all visible pet hair and threads. Use your scissors or utility knife to carefully cut through any heavily tangled sections. Be careful not to cut the brush bristles themselves. Once cut, you can often pull the hair away in large clumps. I usually use my fingers to comb through the bristles and extract smaller bits. Pay close attention to the ends of the brush roll. Hair often wraps tightly around the axles.

This step is critical because tangled hair prevents the brush from rotating freely. It also reduces its ability to agitate the carpet effectively. Take your time here. Ensure every strand of hair is gone. This helps your Bissell clean efficiently. This is especially important when dealing with pet messes, as covered in [how to clean pet urine from carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-pet-urine-from-carpet). The cleaner heads can become quite saturated with pet dander and other debris. Effective removal directly improves cleaning performance. You might also want to review [how to get pet urine out of carpet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-pet-urine-out-of-carpet) to understand the full scope of pet stain issues.

#### Rinsing and Scrubbing the Brush

Once the hair is removed, it is time to wash the brush roll. Rinse it under warm running water. Use your stiff-bristled brush or an old toothbrush to scrub the bristles. Apply a small amount of mild soap if needed. This helps remove any caked-on dirt or residue. Make sure to clean between all the bristles.

Rinse the brush until no more suds appear and the water runs clear. Shake off excess water. Allow the brush roll to air dry completely. Place it on a clean towel in a well-ventilated area. Drying can take several hours, even overnight. Do not reassemble the cleaner until all parts are bone dry. This prevents mold and mildew growth.

#### Clearing Suction Nozzles

While the brush roll dries, turn your attention to the suction nozzles. These are the openings on the cleaner head where the dirty water and debris get sucked up. They can become clogged with lint, hair, or dried cleaning solution. Inspect these nozzles for any visible blockages.

If you see a clog, use a paper clip or a thin piece of wire to carefully poke it out. You can also try flushing the nozzles with warm water. Hold the cleaner head under a faucet, allowing water to run through the nozzles. Watch for debris to be pushed out. Ensure the water flows freely through all openings. A clogged nozzle means weak suction. Weak suction means dirty, wet carpets. Clear nozzles are essential for proper operation.

### Cleaning the Water Tanks and Housing

Cleaning your Bissell pet carpet cleaner heads also includes the tanks and main housing. These parts are just as important for maintaining hygiene and preventing odors. Neglecting them can lead to mildew and a stale smell. I always make sure to give these areas a good scrub.

Start with the dirty water tank. After each cleaning session, you should always empty and rinse this tank. For a deep clean, fill it with warm water and a little mild soap. Swish the mixture around vigorously. Pour it out. You might see a lot of grime coming out. Use a brush to scrub the inside of the tank if there is caked-on dirt. Rinse thoroughly until the water runs clear and no soap residue remains. Make sure the tank is completely dry before storing.

Next, clean the clean water tank. Even though it holds clean water and solution, residue can build up. Empty any remaining solution. Rinse the tank with warm water. If you notice any film, add a small amount of white vinegar and water. Swish it around. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then rinse it thoroughly. Vinegar helps remove mineral deposits and sanitizes the tank.

Finally, wipe down the main housing of your Bissell cleaner. Use a damp cloth to clean the exterior surfaces. Pay attention to the areas around the cleaner head where splashes and drips occur. Wipe around the seals and gaskets. These areas can harbor grime and moisture. Cleaning them helps prevent mold and keeps your machine looking good. Mold is a common issue, and understanding [does pet carpet cleaner work on mold](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-pet-carpet-cleaner-work-on-mold) is important for general machine hygiene. Using [what is the strongest Bissell carpet soap](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-the-strongest-bissel-carpet-soap) for cleaning carpets is great. But a mild soap is sufficient for cleaning the machine itself. Ensure every part is clean and dry. This complete cleaning process makes your machine fresh and ready for its next use.

### Reassembly and Testing Your Clean Bissell

Once all parts are clean and completely dry, it is time for reassembly. This step is just as important as disassembly. Proper reassembly ensures your Bissell pet carpet cleaner heads work correctly. It also prevents leaks or damage during future use. I always take my time with this part.

Start by placing the dry brush roll back into its compartment. Make sure it sits correctly in its bearings or slots. It should spin freely without resistance. If you took photos during disassembly, refer to them now. This helps ensure everything goes back in its original position. Ensure any end caps or small components are reattached.

Next, reattach the brush roll cover. Align it carefully over the brush roll. Ensure any tabs or clips click into place securely. If there were screws, reinsert and tighten them. Do not overtighten, as this can strip the plastic. The cover should sit flush with the main body of the cleaner head. Any gaps could affect suction.

Once the cleaner head is reassembled, put the clean water and dirty water tanks back onto the machine. Make sure they are seated firmly. Fill the clean water tank with fresh water. Add your preferred cleaning solution. I always use the recommended Bissell solution for optimal results. It is important to know if [can you use RugDoctor carpet cleaner in a Bissell](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-use-rugdoctor-carpet-cleaner-in-a-bissel) or if [will Bissell carpet cleaner work in Rug Doctor machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/will-bissel-carpet-cleaner-work-in-rug-doctor-mahine) if you own multiple brands, to ensure compatibility. Using the wrong solution might not clean as effectively.

Finally, plug the machine back in. Turn it on for a quick test. Listen for any unusual noises. Observe if the brush roll spins correctly. Check for proper suction by running it over a small section of carpet. You should see dirty water filling the recovery tank. If everything works as expected, you have successfully cleaned and reassembled your Bissell pet carpet cleaner heads. Your machine is now ready for its next cleaning task, performing like new.

### Regular Maintenance for Lasting Performance

Cleaning Bissell pet carpet cleaner heads thoroughly is a big job. But ongoing, regular maintenance is key to preventing future deep cleans from being so challenging. It also ensures your machine performs optimally every single time. I have learned that a little effort after each use saves a lot of trouble later.

After every cleaning session, perform a quick rinse. Empty the dirty water tank immediately. Rinse it out thoroughly with warm water. This prevents dirt and grime from drying and sticking inside. Do the same for the clean water tank. Empty any remaining solution and rinse it. This stops solution residue from building up.

Next, give the cleaner head a quick once-over. Remove any large clumps of pet hair or debris tangled around the brush roll. You can usually do this without full disassembly. Use scissors or your fingers. A quick wipe down of the exterior surfaces with a damp cloth is also helpful. This removes splashes and keeps the machine looking clean.

Store your Bissell cleaner in a dry, temperate place. Avoid extreme heat or cold. Ensure all tanks are empty and dry before storage. Leaving water in the tanks can lead to mildew and unpleasant smells. Air circulation is important. Keeping your machine dry helps prevent issues like mold, which you can learn more about by searching "[does pet carpet cleaner work on mold](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-pet-carpet-cleaner-work-on-mold)".

Consider a deeper clean of the cleaner heads every 3-6 months. This depends on how frequently you use your machine and how many pets you have. If you notice reduced suction, a bad smell, or inefficient cleaning, it is time for a deep clean sooner.
