## Master Sewing a Zipper on Your Pillow: A DIY Guide

Have you ever looked at a store-bought pillow cover and wished you could make one just as functional and beautiful? Adding a zipper to your homemade pillow covers is a game-changer. It allows for easy removal and cleaning, keeping your living space fresh and inviting. This guide will show you exactly how to sew a zipper on a pillow, transforming your sewing projects.

We will cover everything from choosing the right materials to finishing your project with a professional touch. This skill will make your DIY pillow covers durable and practical. Get ready to enhance your home decor with custom, zippered pillows that truly stand out.

### Takeaway:

*   Adding a zipper to a pillow cover makes it easy to remove and wash.
*   Choosing the right zipper type, like an invisible zipper, gives a clean finish.
*   Precise measuring and careful pressing are key steps for a successful project.
*   Learning to sew a zipper opens up many creative home decor possibilities.

Sewing a zipper on a pillow involves attaching a zipper tape to two fabric pieces, creating an opening for a pillow insert. This technique makes the pillow cover removable and washable. You will use a sewing machine with a zipper foot to achieve a neat and strong seam.

### Why Add a Zipper to Your Pillow Cover?

Adding a zipper to your pillow covers offers many practical benefits. A zippered opening allows you to easily remove the cover for cleaning. This keeps your pillows fresh, especially in high-traffic areas or homes with pets and children. Imagine how simple it will be to refresh your sofa cushions or decorative throw pillows.

Beyond hygiene, zippers add a professional look to your handmade items. They provide a tidy closure that blends into the design. This creates a finished product that looks just like something from a high-end boutique. You can also easily change out pillow inserts to adjust firmness or swap covers for a seasonal decor change. This versatility makes zippered covers a smart choice for any home.

#### Enhanced Cleaning and Maintenance

Pillows can collect dust, allergens, and spills over time. If your pillow covers are sewn shut, cleaning them becomes a difficult task. A zippered cover solves this problem completely. You simply unzip the cover, slide out the pillow insert, and toss the fabric into the washing machine. This process is simple and saves a lot of time.

Regular cleaning extends the life of your pillows and promotes a healthier home environment. You can follow specific washing instructions for your fabric. For instance, if you use delicate fabrics, you can easily hand wash them or use a gentle cycle. For general care, consider reading guides on [how to clean pillow cases](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-pillow-cases) to maintain their look and feel. This ensures your pillows remain a cozy and hygienic part of your home.

#### Customization and Versatility

Sewing your own zippered pillow covers opens up a world of creative possibilities. You are no longer limited to what stores offer. You can choose any fabric, pattern, or color that perfectly matches your home decor. This allows for truly personalized items that reflect your style.

Zippered covers also mean you can update your decor quickly and affordably. Instead of buying new pillows, just swap out the covers. This is perfect for seasonal changes or when you want to refresh a room's look. You can also easily add other decorative elements, such as [how to make a ruffle for a pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-a-ruffle-for-a-pillow), knowing you can still clean the main cover. This flexibility makes zippered pillows a favorite for DIY enthusiasts.

### Gathering Your Tools to Sew a Zipper

Before you start sewing, gather all necessary tools and materials. Having everything ready saves time and ensures a smooth process. You will need your fabric, a zipper, and basic sewing supplies. Proper preparation is essential for a successful project.

A sewing machine is critical, and a specific foot for zippers helps greatly. Make sure your needles are sharp and suitable for your fabric type. A dull needle can snag fabric or cause uneven stitches. Think of this step as setting up your workspace for creativity and efficiency.

#### Choosing the Right Zipper

The type of zipper you choose affects both the look and function of your pillow. For a clean, seamless appearance, an invisible zipper is usually the best choice. These zippers hide the teeth and tape within the seam, making them almost unnoticeable. They are perfect for decorative pillows where you want the focus to be on the fabric design.

Coil zippers are another good option; they are durable and come in various lengths. Avoid heavy-duty metal zippers unless your pillow is for outdoor use or requires a very strong closure. Match the zipper length to your pillow opening; it should be shorter than the pillow width by several inches. For example, a 20-inch pillow might use an 18-inch zipper. This ensures the zipper fits well within the seam allowance.

#### Fabric and Notions

Select a fabric that suits your pillow's purpose and your sewing skill level. Cotton, linen, and home decor fabrics are popular choices for pillow covers. They are easy to work with and durable. Avoid very slippery or stretchy fabrics if you are new to sewing zippers, as they can be challenging. Always pre-wash your fabric to prevent shrinkage after the pillow is made.

In addition to fabric and zippers, you will need several notions. These include a good quality polyester thread that matches your fabric, sharp fabric scissors or a rotary cutter, and a cutting mat. You also need pins or fabric clips to hold pieces together, an iron and ironing board for pressing seams, and a seam ripper for corrections. A zipper foot for your sewing machine is vital for getting close to the zipper teeth. This specialized foot makes the process much easier and yields a professional result.

### Preparing Fabric and Zipper for Precise Attachment

Accurate preparation is crucial when you sew a zipper on a pillow. This stage involves precise measuring, cutting, and pressing. These steps lay the foundation for a neat and perfectly fitted pillow cover. Taking your time here will prevent issues later in the sewing process.

I always double-check my measurements before cutting to avoid wasting fabric. Pressing the fabric pieces correctly helps them lie flat and ensures clean lines. This attention to detail will result in a much more professional-looking finished product. It is a fundamental step for any sewing project, similar to planning out a larger item like [how to sew a chair slipcover](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-sew-a-chair-slipcover).

#### Accurate Measuring and Cutting

First, determine the finished size of your pillow cover. For a snug fit, cut your fabric pieces the same size as your pillow insert, or slightly smaller (e.g., 19.5 inches for a 20-inch pillow). You will need two main fabric pieces for the front and back of the pillow. Add seam allowance to all four sides of each fabric piece. A standard seam allowance is 1/2 inch. So, for a 20x20 inch pillow, cut two pieces of fabric at 21x21 inches.

Measure carefully using a ruler or measuring tape. Cut your fabric precisely with sharp fabric scissors or a rotary cutter. Straight cuts are essential for straight seams and a well-fitting pillow cover. Mark the center of the edge where the zipper will go on both fabric pieces. This mark helps align the zipper perfectly.

#### Prepping the Zipper and Fabric Edge

Before attaching the zipper, prepare the fabric edge. Press one long edge of each fabric piece back by your chosen seam allowance (e.g., 1/2 inch). This creates a crisp fold for zipper placement. For an invisible zipper, you will simply press the seam allowance, not fold it over.

Next, place the zipper right side down along the raw edge of one fabric piece, aligning the zipper tape with the pressed seam allowance. Ensure the zipper pull is at one end and the zipper stopper is at the other. Pin the zipper in place securely. Repeat this process for the second fabric piece, aligning it with the other side of the zipper. Make sure both fabric pieces are aligned correctly. This alignment is vital for a straight zipper installation.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Sewing an Invisible Zipper on a Pillow

Sewing an invisible zipper can seem daunting at first, but with clear steps, it becomes simple. The key is to use the right sewing machine foot and take your time. This method ensures the zipper almost disappears into the seam, giving your pillow a polished, professional look. I always find that a steady hand and patience produce the best results.

Remember, practice makes perfect. Do not be afraid to try on scrap fabric first. Once you master this technique, you will be able to add zippers to all sorts of items, not just pillows. This skill is a fantastic addition to any sewing repertoire.

#### Pinning and Basting the Zipper

Lay one of your pillow fabric pieces right side up. Place the invisible zipper face down along the edge where it will be sewn, aligning the zipper teeth with your marked seam line (or slightly in from the raw edge if you're pressing a seam allowance later). The zipper pull should be at the top end of the pillow. Pin the zipper tape securely to the fabric edge. Use plenty of pins, placing them perpendicular to the edge to hold the zipper firmly.

Next, attach the invisible zipper foot to your sewing machine. This specialized foot has grooves that allow the needle to stitch very close to the zipper teeth. Start stitching from the top of the zipper, moving downwards. Stitch as close to the zipper teeth as possible without stitching onto them. Stop stitching about 1/2 inch from the zipper bottom or before the zipper pull if it is in the way. Backstitch to secure the thread. Repeat this process for the second side of the zipper, attaching it to the other fabric piece. Ensure the fabrics are still right sides up and aligned when pinning.

#### Machine Stitching the Zipper

With the zipper basted or pinned, you are ready to sew it permanently. Start by placing the fabric piece with one side of the zipper attached under your sewing machine's invisible zipper foot. Align the zipper teeth with the groove on the zipper foot. Stitch slowly and steadily, guiding the fabric and zipper. The goal is to get your needle as close to the zipper teeth as possible without actually stitching *into* them. Stitch from the top down to the zipper stopper.

Once one side is sewn, close the zipper. This helps you align the second fabric piece properly. Pin the second fabric piece to the other side of the zipper, ensuring the edges match up perfectly. Open the zipper again before stitching to allow the zipper foot to pass smoothly. Stitch this second side, again going from top to bottom. Take care to keep your stitches straight and evenly spaced. After stitching, you can gently pull the zipper open and closed to ensure it operates smoothly and is not caught in the fabric.

#### Closing the Seam

After sewing the zipper, you need to close the remaining opening at the end of the zipper. Open the zipper about halfway. Lay the two fabric pieces right sides together, aligning the raw edges of the opening below the zipper. Pin the seam allowance together. Switch to a regular zipper foot or a standard presser foot.

Stitch the remaining seam, starting about an inch above where your zipper stitching ended. Overlap your zipper stitches slightly to ensure a strong, continuous seam. Backstitch at the beginning and end to secure the seam. This creates a neat, continuous seam that looks like one piece of fabric, with the zipper seamlessly integrated. Once this seam is sewn, your zipper is fully installed and ready for the final steps.

### Finishing Your Zippered Pillow and Pro Tips

You have successfully sewn the zipper onto your pillow covers. Now, it's time to complete the pillow. This involves sewing the remaining seams and turning the pillow cover right side out. A few final touches ensure your pillow looks great and holds up well.

These steps are quick and bring your project to life. I find satisfaction in seeing the transformation from flat fabric to a plump, functional pillow. Remember that patience and precision continue to be your allies here.

#### Sewing the Remaining Pillow Seams

With the zipper now securely sewn into one side, you can finish the rest of the pillow cover. Lay your two fabric pieces right sides together, ensuring all edges align perfectly. Pin around the three remaining open sides of the pillow cover. Use plenty of pins to prevent shifting.

Using a regular sewing machine foot and your chosen seam allowance (e.g., 1/2 inch), stitch around these three pinned sides. Start stitching from the end of your zipper seam and pivot at each corner, ending at the other end of the zipper seam. Backstitch at the beginning and end of your stitching for added strength. To reduce bulk and ensure crisp corners, trim the corners of the seam allowance diagonally without cutting through your stitches. For added durability, you can serge or zigzag stitch the raw edges of the seams to prevent fraying, similar to how [how to wash a sew-in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-a-sew-in) requires finishing seams.

#### Inserting Your Pillow Form

Once all seams are sewn and trimmed, it's time to turn your pillow cover right side out. Reach into the zippered opening and gently push out all the corners. Use a point turner or a dull pencil to ensure your corners are sharp and well-defined. Press the seams flat with an iron for a crisp, professional finish.

Now, fully open the zipper and carefully insert your pillow form or cushion insert. Gently maneuver the insert into the corners of the cover. Smooth out the fabric to ensure the insert fills the cover completely without bunching. Once the insert is in place, close the zipper. You now have a beautifully finished, removable pillow cover ready to adorn your home.

### Tips for Professional Looking Zippered Pillows

Achieving a professional finish when you sew a zipper on a pillow takes a little extra care. These tips will help you get the best results every time. Small details can make a big difference in the overall appearance of your handmade items. I learned these tricks through practice, and they truly elevate a project.

Consistency in your stitching and thorough pressing are key elements. Do not rush these steps. They are just as important as the sewing itself.

#### Pressing Matters

Pressing is a crucial step that many sewers overlook. It is not the same as ironing. Pressing involves lifting and setting the iron down, rather than sliding it. After each major sewing step, take your fabric to the ironing board and press your seams. For zipper installation, pressing the seam allowances open or to one side before sewing the zipper helps create a smooth, flat surface for attachment.

Once the zipper is sewn, gently press the finished seam. This makes the zipper lie flat and helps it blend into the fabric. Pressing also helps shape the pillow cover, making it crisp and clean. A well-pressed pillow looks much more polished than one with wrinkled seams. Always use the appropriate heat setting for your fabric to avoid scorching.

#### Stitching Consistency

Consistent stitch length and straight lines are vital for a professional-looking zipper. Use a consistent seam allowance throughout your project. If your stitches are wobbly, consider practicing on scrap fabric first. Slow down your sewing machine if necessary. Using a guiding line on your sewing machine plate or painters tape can help keep your stitching straight.

Backstitching at the beginning and end of each seam provides strength. For the zipper, ensure your stitches are close to the teeth but not on them. This allows the zipper to open and close smoothly. Taking the time to ensure neat, consistent stitches will greatly improve the quality of your finished pillow. It shows attention to detail and craftsmanship.

### FAQ Section

#### What is the best type of zipper to use for a pillow cover?
The best zipper for a pillow cover is typically an invisible zipper. It blends seamlessly into the fabric, making the zipper teeth and tape nearly undetectable. This creates a clean and professional look for your decorative or functional pillows. Coil zippers are also a good, durable alternative if an invisible look is not the top priority.

#### How long should the zipper be compared to the pillow width?
The zipper should be shorter than the pillow's total width. For most pillow covers, choose a zipper that is 2 to 4 inches shorter than the intended finished width of the pillow opening. For example, if your pillow is 20 inches wide, an 18-inch zipper is usually ideal. This allows for a clean finish at both ends of the zipper.

#### Can I sew a zipper on a pillow without a special zipper foot?
While possible, sewing a zipper without a zipper foot is more challenging and can lead to less precise results. A zipper foot allows the needle to stitch very close to the zipper teeth. Without it, you might stitch too far or too close, causing the zipper to get caught or not lie flat. I recommend investing in a zipper foot for easier and better results.

#### How do I hide the raw edges of the zipper tape inside the pillow?
To hide the raw edges of the zipper tape, ensure your seam allowance is wide enough. After sewing the zipper, you can trim the seam allowance or finish it with a serger or zigzag stitch. This prevents fraying. Pressing the seams open or to one side also helps the zipper tape lie flat and stay concealed within the pillow cover.

#### What fabric is best for a first-time zippered pillow project?
For a first-time zippered pillow project, I recommend using a stable, medium-weight woven fabric like cotton or linen. These fabrics are easy to handle, do not stretch much, and hold their shape well. Avoid slippery fabrics like satin or very stretchy knits until you are more comfortable with zipper installation techniques.

#### How do I prevent the zipper from puckering the fabric?
To prevent puckering, always press your fabric pieces flat before sewing. Pin the zipper securely and generously to the fabric, using many pins close together. Stitch slowly and evenly, guiding the fabric smoothly through the machine. You can also use a walking foot if your fabric tends to shift.

You now know the essential tools, proper preparation techniques, and the detailed steps to sew a zipper. From selecting the right zipper to pressing your finished seams, each step contributes to a durable, professional-looking pillow cover.
