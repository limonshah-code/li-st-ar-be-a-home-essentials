## Why Your Samsung Washer Won't Drain: Common Fixes

It is a frustrating problem when your laundry finishes a cycle, but the washing machine remains full of water. You stand there, looking at soggy clothes, wondering "Why won't my Samsung washing machine drain?" This issue stops your laundry routine dead in its tracks. You need to get that water out and your machine working again. This guide explains the most common reasons your Samsung washer has stopped draining. I will show you how to diagnose the problem and provide clear steps to fix it. We will cover everything from simple clogs to more serious part failures. You can get your machine running correctly and avoid future draining issues.

### Takeaway

*   Check for clogs in the drain filter and drain hose first. These are the most common and easiest fixes.
*   Inspect the drain pump for blockages or damage. A faulty pump cannot remove water.
*   Reset your washing machine to clear minor electronic glitches.
*   Ensure the lid or door lock functions correctly. The machine will not drain if it thinks the door is open.
*   Consult a professional if basic troubleshooting does not solve the problem.

Your Samsung washing machine will not drain often due to a clogged drain filter, a blocked drain hose, or a faulty drain pump. Less common causes include a malfunctioning lid switch or door lock, a bad pressure sensor, or an electronic control board issue. Addressing these components usually resolves the problem.

### Clogged Drain Filter: A Common Culprit

A clogged drain filter is a very common reason why your Samsung washing machine won't drain. This filter catches lint, coins, buttons, and other small items that come off your clothes. Over time, these items build up. This blockage prevents water from flowing out of the machine properly. The washer cannot complete its drain cycle.

Checking and cleaning this filter should always be your first step. Ignoring a dirty filter leads to drain problems and could even damage your drain pump. Regular cleaning keeps your machine running efficiently. It prevents water from pooling in the drum. I make sure to clean mine every few months to avoid these issues. If you need more general information about this part, you can learn more about [what is a drain filter on a Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-drain-filter-on-samsung-washing-machine).

#### Locating and Cleaning the Drain Filter

Finding the drain filter on your Samsung washer is usually simple. It is typically located at the bottom front of the machine. Look for a small access panel or a round cap. You might need a flathead screwdriver to open the panel. Once you open the panel, you will see a small hose and a large cap.

Before you remove the filter, prepare for some water spillage. Keep towels and a shallow pan ready. First, unscrew the small drain hose cap and let the residual water drain into your pan. This step prevents a messy flood. Once the water stops, you can unscrew the main drain filter cap counter-clockwise.

Carefully pull out the filter. You will likely find lint, hair, and maybe some forgotten coins or buttons. Clean the filter thoroughly under running water. Remove all debris. Check the filter housing for any blockages too. Make sure nothing remains inside. Replace the filter by screwing it back in clockwise. Then, replace the small drain hose cap and close the access panel. Run a short test cycle with no clothes to ensure it drains correctly.

### Blocked Drain Hose Issues

Another major reason your Samsung washing machine won't drain is a blocked drain hose. The drain hose carries water from your washer to your standpipe or utility sink. If something blocks this hose, water cannot exit the machine. This blockage can happen inside the hose itself or where the hose connects to the drainage system.

Kinks in the hose are also a common issue. If the hose is bent sharply, water cannot flow through it. Make sure the hose is not crimped or flattened behind the washer. These simple checks can save you time and money. It is crucial to have a clear path for water to leave your machine. If you are dealing with a machine full of water, you will first need to find out [how to drain your Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-your-samsung-washing-machine) manually before proceeding with checks.

#### Inspecting and Clearing the Drain Hose

To inspect the drain hose, you will need to pull your washing machine away from the wall. This gives you better access to the back of the appliance. First, turn off the water supply to the washer and unplug it from the power outlet. Safety is important when working with appliances. Examine the entire length of the drain hose for any visible kinks or bends. Straighten any sections that appear crimped.

Next, disconnect the drain hose from the standpipe or sink. Check both ends for blockages. You might find lint, soap scum, or foreign objects lodged inside. If you suspect a clog deep within the hose, you can try flushing it with water from a garden hose. Alternatively, use a long, flexible brush to dislodge any debris. You can also disconnect the hose from the back of the washer. This allows for a more thorough inspection. Ensure the hose is not pushed too far down into the standpipe. Too much insertion creates a siphoning effect, which can also cause draining issues. After clearing any blockages and ensuring the hose is free of kinks, reattach it securely. Then, run a test cycle. If you still have trouble, you might need to investigate [how to empty washing machine drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-empty-washing-machine-drain) in more detail.

### Faulty Drain Pump: Signs and Solutions

If your Samsung washing machine won't drain and you've already checked the filter and hose for clogs, the drain pump might be the problem. The drain pump is a motor-driven component responsible for forcing water out of the wash tub. When it fails, water simply sits in the machine. You might hear a buzzing noise coming from the washer but no water movement. This sound indicates the motor is trying to work but cannot.

Sometimes, a foreign object can get stuck in the pump's impeller, preventing it from spinning. Other times, the pump motor itself simply fails. This often requires replacing the entire pump assembly. A drain pump failure is a common issue with washing machines that see a lot of use. It is important to address this issue quickly to restore proper function.

#### Testing and Replacing the Drain Pump

Testing your Samsung washing machine's drain pump can be a bit more involved than cleaning a filter. First, disconnect power to the washer. Locate the drain pump, which is usually at the bottom front or side of the machine. You might need to tilt the washer back or remove a lower access panel. Once you find the pump, look for any visible obstructions around the impeller. Sometimes, a sock or a hair clip gets through the filter and jams the pump. Clear any debris you find.

To test the pump motor, you might need a multimeter to check for continuity. However, for most homeowners, a simpler test involves trying to manually spin the impeller (if accessible) to see if it moves freely. If it feels stiff, jammed, or if the motor hums but does not pump water, the pump likely needs replacement. Replacing the drain pump involves disconnecting hoses and electrical connectors, then installing a new pump. Ensure you get the correct replacement part for your specific Samsung model. This is a task that some DIYers can handle, but if you are unsure, calling a qualified technician is a good idea. They have the tools and expertise to ensure the job is done safely and correctly.

### Pressure Sensor Problems and Door Lock Malfunctions

Beyond clogs and pump issues, two other components can cause your Samsung washing machine to stop draining: the pressure sensor and the door lock mechanism. The pressure sensor (also known as a water level sensor) tells the washing machine how much water is in the tub. If this sensor malfunctions, it might incorrectly believe the tub is empty, or it could prevent the drain cycle from starting. This miscommunication keeps the machine from proceeding.

The door lock mechanism is another critical safety feature. Modern washing machines will not operate or drain if the door is not securely latched. If the door lock is faulty, the machine might think the door is open, even when it is closed. This prevents any further cycle progression, including draining. Understanding these parts helps you diagnose the problem more accurately. These problems can certainly lead to situations where [why won't my washing machine empty](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-washing-machine-empty) becomes a frustrating question.

#### Checking the Pressure Sensor

A faulty pressure sensor can trick your Samsung washer into thinking it has too much or too little water, disrupting the drain cycle. You can often locate the pressure sensor near the top of the wash tub, connected by a thin air tube. To check it, first, disconnect power to your washer. Carefully remove the air tube from the sensor and blow through it to clear any blockages. Debris in this tube can cause inaccurate readings.

Sometimes, simply unplugging and replugging the sensor's electrical connector can reset it. If the issue persists, the sensor itself might be faulty. Replacement involves disconnecting the old sensor and attaching a new one, ensuring the air tube is secure. This component is generally inexpensive and relatively easy to replace for someone comfortable with basic appliance repair.

#### Troubleshooting the Door Lock Mechanism

The door lock is a safety feature on your Samsung washer. It prevents the door from opening during a cycle. If it malfunctions, the machine may not drain or even spin. The washer's control board receives a signal from the door lock. It must confirm the door is securely closed before starting the drain pump. First, visually inspect the door latch and the strike plate on the machine's frame. Look for any damage, bends, or obstructions that prevent a proper connection.

Sometimes, simply cleaning the latch area can help. Make sure no lint or debris is interfering. If the latch looks fine, but the machine still indicates an open door, the door lock assembly itself might be faulty. This assembly usually contains a switch that signals the control board. Replacing a door lock involves removing the top panel or outer gasket to access the part. Disconnect the electrical wires and screws, then install the new lock. Always unplug the washer before performing any repairs.

### Control Board and Motor Issues

Sometimes, the problem goes beyond simple mechanical parts. If your Samsung washing machine won't drain, and you've ruled out clogs, pump, sensor, and door lock issues, you might face problems with the control board or the motor. The control board is the "brain" of your washing machine. It sends signals to all other components, including the drain pump. If this board malfunctions, it might not tell the pump to activate, even if the pump itself is perfectly fine.

Motor issues are less common for draining specifically but can indirectly affect it. If the main motor fails or the belt that drives the pump (in some models) breaks, the machine might not be able to complete any part of its cycle, including draining. These are more complex problems and often require professional diagnosis. However, a simple reset can sometimes clear minor glitches in the control board.

#### Resetting Your Samsung Washer

Before assuming a serious component failure, try resetting your Samsung washing machine. A power reset can clear temporary electronic glitches that might be preventing the drain cycle. This is an easy first step and costs nothing. It often resolves issues with the control board's communication. Many electronic devices benefit from a simple restart.

To reset your washer, first unplug it from the wall outlet. Leave it unplugged for at least 5 to 10 minutes. This gives the control board enough time to fully discharge any residual electricity and clear its memory. After waiting, plug the washer back into the outlet. Close the door firmly and try to start a drain/spin cycle. If the issue was a minor software glitch, the machine should now drain properly. If this does not work, the problem is likely mechanical or a more significant electronic failure.

#### Identifying Control Board Failures

Identifying a faulty control board is challenging without specialized tools. However, some signs can point to this issue if your Samsung washing machine won't drain. If the machine behaves erratically, displays unusual error codes that do not clear, or if multiple functions fail simultaneously (e.g., it won't fill, wash, or drain), the control board might be failing. Visual inspection sometimes reveals burnt spots or damaged components on the board itself, but this is rare and dangerous to do without proper safety knowledge.

A faulty control board often means you need a professional technician. They have diagnostic tools to test the board's functionality. Replacing a control board is expensive and requires careful handling. It is also crucial to ensure you get the exact replacement part for your Samsung model. Incorrect installation can lead to further damage. For most homeowners, replacing a control board is beyond typical DIY repairs.

Preventing future draining issues with your Samsung washing machine is easier than fixing them. Regular maintenance extends the life of your appliance and keeps it running smoothly. By taking a few simple steps, you can significantly reduce the chances of your washer leaving you with a tub full of water. These tips focus on the common causes we have discussed.

Proper maintenance also ensures your clothes are thoroughly cleaned and rinsed. It helps avoid unpleasant odors in your machine. A well-maintained washer is a happy washer. I have learned over time that a little preventative effort saves a lot of hassle. Understanding [what does it mean when your washing machine won't drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-does-it-mean-when-your-washing-machine-wont-drain) helps you know what to look for, but proactive steps are even better.

Here are some essential maintenance tips:

*   **Clean the Drain Filter Regularly:** Make it a habit to clean your washer's drain filter every one to three months. This frequency depends on how often you do laundry and if you wash items that shed a lot of lint or have small objects in pockets.
    *   Set a reminder on your phone or mark it on your calendar.
    *   Always have towels and a shallow pan ready for the water.
    *   Ensure the filter is free of all debris before reinserting it.
*   **Inspect the Drain Hose:** Periodically check the drain hose for kinks, bends, or blockages.
    *   Pull the machine out occasionally to ensure the hose is straight.
    *   Confirm the hose is not pushed too far into the standpipe.
    *   Clean the hose if you see any build-up or foreign objects.
*   **Use the Right Amount of Detergent:** Too much detergent creates excessive suds. These suds can clog the drain system. They can also create residue that builds up over time.
    *   Follow the detergent manufacturer's recommendations.
    *   Use high-efficiency (HE) detergent if your washer is an HE model.
*   **Check Pockets Before Washing:** Always empty pockets before putting clothes in the washer. This prevents coins, keys, or other small items from entering the drain system. Such items are notorious for getting caught in the drain pump or filter.
*   **Run a Cleaning Cycle:** Many Samsung washers have a "Self Clean" or "Eco Tub Clean" cycle. Use this feature monthly to clean the tub and remove detergent residue. This helps prevent mold, mildew, and scum build-up that can contribute to drain issues.
*   **Balance the Load:** An unbalanced load can cause the washer to vibrate excessively. This vibration can potentially shift the drain hose or loosen connections. Distribute clothes evenly in the drum. Avoid washing one very heavy item alone.

By following these simple maintenance steps, you can prevent most common draining problems. Your Samsung washing machine will serve you reliably for many years.
