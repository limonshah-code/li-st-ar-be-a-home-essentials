## Samsung Dishwasher Not Turning Off? Solutions Here!

Is your Samsung dishwasher stuck in a cycle, refusing to power down, or simply running endlessly? This can be very frustrating. A dishwasher that will not turn off poses an inconvenience and a potential waste of energy. Many Samsung dishwasher owners experience this problem. You are not alone in facing this common appliance issue.

I understand how disruptive this can be to your daily routine. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the core reasons why your Samsung dishwasher is not turning off. We will explore simple diagnostic steps and effective solutions. You will find practical advice to get your appliance working correctly again. Let's fix this problem together.

### Takeaway

*   **Perform a Hard Reset:** Disconnect power for a few minutes to clear glitches.
*   **Check the Door Latch:** A faulty or unsecured door latch can prevent cycle completion.
*   **Inspect Drain System:** Clogs or pump issues keep water inside, stopping the cycle.

*   **Assess Sensors:** Malfunctioning water level or turbidity sensors can confuse the dishwasher.
*   **Examine Control Panel:** Buttons stuck or a main control board issue might be present.
*   **Seek Professional Help:** Contact a technician for complex electrical or component failures.

Your Samsung dishwasher is not turning off typically due to a cycle interruption, a drainage problem, or an electronic control fault. The machine expects certain conditions, like water draining completely, to end its operation. When these conditions are not met, the dishwasher often continues to run or gets stuck.

### Immediate Checks: What to Do First When Your Samsung Dishwasher Won't Stop

When your Samsung dishwasher refuses to turn off, start with a few quick checks. These initial steps can resolve many common issues. They are easy to perform and do not require special tools. My first recommendation is always a power cycle.

A power cycle, also known as a hard reset, clears minor electronic glitches. You need to disconnect your dishwasher from its power source. Find the circuit breaker panel in your home. Locate the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. Turn this breaker off for about 5 minutes. After waiting, turn the breaker back on. This simple reset often fixes temporary electronic problems.

Next, check the dishwasher door latch. The dishwasher needs the door to be fully closed and latched to operate correctly. If the latch is faulty or the door is not shut completely, the dishwasher might not progress or finish its cycle. Inspect the latch for any damage or obstructions. Make sure nothing blocks the door from closing tightly. Sometimes, simply opening and firmly closing the dishwasher door can fix this issue.

Finally, try pressing the "Cancel" button. Most Samsung dishwashers have a "Cancel" or "Drain" button. Pressing this button usually stops the current cycle and drains any remaining water. Hold the button down for a few seconds. If the dishwasher drains and turns off, the problem might have been a minor cycle hiccup. If it does not respond, a more significant issue exists. These quick checks cover the most basic troubleshooting.

### Understanding Common Reasons Your Samsung Dishwasher Stays On

Several common problems can cause your Samsung dishwasher to run continuously. These issues often relate to how the machine perceives its cycle status. The dishwasher expects specific actions to complete. When these actions do not happen, it keeps trying. This results in the dishwasher not turning off.

One main reason is a cycle that cannot complete. Your dishwasher follows a set program. It includes filling, washing, draining, and drying. If any stage does not finish as expected, the dishwasher gets stuck. For instance, if the water does not drain properly, the dishwasher waits. It will keep running until the drain signal is received. This creates an endless cycle.

Drain pump problems are a frequent cause of this issue. The drain pump removes dirty water from the tub. If the pump is clogged, faulty, or obstructed, water cannot exit. The dishwasher senses water still in the tub. It will not move to the next stage or turn off. Instead, it tries repeatedly to drain the water. This can make the dishwasher run for hours.

Another less common but possible reason is a continuously filling water inlet valve. The water inlet valve controls water entry into the dishwasher. If this valve gets stuck in the open position, water flows into the tub without stopping. The dishwasher's water level sensor will detect constant water. It will prevent the cycle from progressing. The machine may try to drain endlessly or simply keep running. These components are vital for proper operation.

### Sensor Malfunctions: Why Your Samsung Dishwasher Keeps Running

Sensors are the "eyes and ears" of your Samsung dishwasher. They provide crucial information to the main control board. If any sensor malfunctions, the dishwasher can receive incorrect data. This leads to faulty operations, including the machine not turning off. Understanding these sensors helps in troubleshooting.

The water level sensor, or float switch, is very important. This sensor tells the dishwasher if there is enough water or too much water. If the float switch gets stuck in the "full" position, the dishwasher might continuously try to drain. It will never register as empty. Conversely, if it thinks there is no water, it might keep filling. This constant effort prevents the cycle from ending. You can often find the float switch at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. When you need to inspect internal components, remembering [how to open a Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-open-samsung-dishwasher) properly is key.

The turbidity sensor also plays a role. This sensor measures how dirty the wash water is. It helps the dishwasher decide how long and how intensely to wash. If the turbidity sensor fails, it might continuously report that the water is dirty. This would cause the dishwasher to extend the wash cycle indefinitely. The dishwasher will keep washing, never moving to rinse or dry. The sensor helps optimize cleaning, but a faulty one can create problems.

Finally, the temperature sensor, or thermistor, checks the water temperature. Dishwashers need water to reach a certain temperature for effective cleaning and sanitization. If the temperature sensor fails, it might never signal that the water is hot enough. The dishwasher would then keep heating, or waiting for heat, endlessly. This prevents the cycle from completing. Each of these sensors plays a specific role. A fault in any one can cause your Samsung dishwasher to not turn off.

### Control Panel and Electrical Issues Affecting Your Samsung Dishwasher

Electronic problems are often at the heart of appliance malfunctions. When your Samsung dishwasher will not turn off, the control panel or other electrical components could be faulty. These parts manage all operations. Any glitch here can lead to unusual behavior.

The control panel is the main interface you interact with. If buttons on the control panel are stuck or unresponsive, the dishwasher might not receive proper commands. For example, the "Cancel" button might not register your input. This would prevent you from manually stopping the cycle. Moisture or damage to the panel can cause these issues. A quick visual inspection can sometimes reveal obvious damage.

The main control board acts as the dishwasher's brain. It processes information from sensors and sends commands to other components. A damaged or faulty control board can cause the dishwasher to behave erratically. It might get stuck in a loop, not recognizing the end of a cycle. Sometimes, power surges can damage this board. A professional usually needs to diagnose and replace a faulty control board. This part is complex and costly.

A less common but serious electrical issue is a tripped thermal fuse. The thermal fuse is a safety device. It cuts power to the dishwasher if it overheats. While usually leading to the dishwasher not turning on at all, a partially failed fuse or related wiring issue could, in rare cases, contribute to intermittent power problems that confuse the control board. Ensuring a stable power supply is also important. Always check connections to the outlet or power source. Issues with power can confuse the dishwasher, leading it to not turn off.

### Drainage System Failures Causing a Samsung Dishwasher Cycle Loop

A fully functional drainage system is critical for your Samsung dishwasher. If the dishwasher cannot drain water properly, it will not complete its cycle. This often results in the machine running indefinitely. It continuously tries to remove water that is still present. This cycle loop is a common reason why your Samsung dishwasher does not turn off.

The most common culprit is a clogged drain filter. The filter collects food particles and debris. If it gets too full, water struggles to pass through. You should clean the drain filter regularly. It is usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. To access and clean this filter, knowing [how to open a Samsung dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-open-samsung-dishwasher) correctly is helpful. Remove it, rinse it under running water, and clear any trapped debris. A clean filter allows for smooth water drainage.

Next, inspect the drain hose for blockages or kinks. The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. If the hose is bent sharply, crushed, or clogged with food particles, water flow is restricted. Disconnect the hose and check for obstructions. Clear any blockages you find. Ensure the hose has a proper air gap or high loop to prevent backflow.

A faulty drain pump is another significant issue. The drain pump pushes water out of the dishwasher. If the pump motor fails or something jams its impeller, it cannot perform its function. You might hear humming noises without water draining. Replacing a drain pump often requires professional help. It is a more involved repair. Each component in the drainage system must work correctly for the dishwasher to finish its cycle and turn off.

### Troubleshooting Specific Samsung Dishwasher Error Codes

Samsung dishwashers are smart appliances. They often display error codes when something goes wrong. These codes are like clues. They tell you what part of the dishwasher needs attention. When your Samsung dishwasher is not turning off, checking for error codes is an essential step.

Many codes relate directly to common reasons for a dishwasher staying on. For example, codes like "OE" or "OC" often indicate a drainage problem. "OE" typically means an overflow error or a drain error. "OC" can point to a leak detected. If your dishwasher cannot drain, it gets stuck. It keeps running to try and clear the water. Recognizing these codes helps you focus your troubleshooting.

Consult your Samsung dishwasher owner's manual for a full list of error codes. The manual explains what each code means. It also provides basic steps to fix the issue. For instance, if you see an "OE" code, the manual will suggest checking the drain hose and filter. I always keep my appliance manuals handy for this reason. They are valuable resources.

Sometimes, an error code might not show directly on the display. It might flash or appear intermittently. Pay attention to any unusual light patterns or sounds. These can also be indicators of a problem. If the error code points to a sensor or pump, you can then follow the specific troubleshooting steps discussed earlier. Understanding these codes saves time. It guides you to the correct repair.

### When to Call a Professional for Your Samsung Dishwasher Problems

While many dishwasher problems have simple fixes, some issues are more serious. These situations require the expertise of a qualified technician. Attempting complex repairs yourself can be dangerous. It might also cause more damage to your appliance. Knowing when to call a professional saves you time and potential headaches.

You should call a professional for complex electrical issues. Problems with the main control board, wiring, or persistent power faults are best handled by experts. Working with electricity carries risks. A technician has the right tools and knowledge for these delicate components. They can safely diagnose and repair electrical systems. This ensures your safety and the dishwasher's correct function.

Persistent problems, even after basic troubleshooting, indicate a deeper issue. If you have tried all the common fixes and your Samsung dishwasher still will not turn off, it is time for professional help. The problem might involve internal components that are difficult to access. For example, a hidden leak or a specific part failure might need specialized tools.
