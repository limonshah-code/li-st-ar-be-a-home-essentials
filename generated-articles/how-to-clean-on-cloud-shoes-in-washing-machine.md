## Machine Wash On Cloud Shoes: A Safe Cleaning Guide

We all love the comfort and performance of our On Cloud shoes. They are lightweight, supportive, and designed for an amazing feel. However, daily wear, especially during runs or walks, can leave them looking less than fresh. Dirt, mud, and sweat can accumulate quickly, making them appear dull. Many people wonder about the best way to restore their shoes to a pristine condition.

Cleaning your favorite athletic footwear often brings up a big question: can you use a washing machine? You want to ensure your shoes look great without causing any damage. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the proper steps to clean On Cloud shoes in a washing machine. I will share my best tips for pre-treatment, selecting the right wash cycle, and safe drying. Let us get those On Cloud shoes looking new again.

### Takeaway

Yes, you can machine wash On Cloud shoes safely. First, remove laces and insoles. Pre-treat stains, then place shoes in a mesh bag with towels. Use a cold, gentle cycle and mild detergent. Air dry away from direct heat.

## Understanding Your On Cloud Shoes Before Washing

Before you clean On Cloud shoes in a washing machine, it is important to understand their construction. On Running designs these shoes with specific materials and technologies. They use lightweight mesh uppers, synthetic overlays, and unique CloudTec® soles. These features provide excellent performance but require careful cleaning.

The mesh fabric is breathable and light. It can be delicate, so harsh scrubbing or hot water can cause damage. Synthetic overlays offer support and structure. They are generally durable but can shrink or warp with improper heat exposure. The CloudTec® sole is a key feature, made of individual "clouds" that cushion your stride. These can collect dirt and debris in their grooves. Understanding these components helps you choose the correct cleaning approach. Proper cleaning protects your investment and maintains shoe performance.

### Material Specifics and Care Needs

On Cloud shoes commonly feature engineered mesh uppers. This material helps with ventilation and keeps the shoe light. However, mesh can trap dirt deep within its fibers. You need a gentle washing method to clean it effectively without tearing or stretching. Many models also have welded or stitched synthetic overlays. These add durability and shape. Extreme heat can weaken the adhesives or alter the shape of these materials.

The unique outsole design, with its hollow pods, is designed for cushioning. While effective for running, these "clouds" can easily pick up small stones or mud. This requires pre-cleaning to remove trapped debris. The internal cushioning and support structures are also important. They need protection from excessive agitation. Knowing these details helps ensure a safe and effective machine wash. This helps maintain the shoe's lifespan and comfort.

## Preparing Your On Cloud Shoes for the Washing Machine

Proper preparation is crucial when you want to clean On Cloud shoes in a washing machine. This step prevents damage and ensures a more effective clean. Skipping preparation steps can lead to poor results or even harm your shoes. I always take my time with this stage. It makes a big difference in the final outcome.

Start by removing everything loose from your shoes. This includes laces and insoles. These items can be washed separately or alongside the shoes. Removing them helps clean all parts of the shoe more thoroughly. It also prevents laces from tangling and insoles from getting bent or damaged during the wash cycle.

### Removing Laces and Insoles

First, carefully remove the shoelaces from both shoes. Laces can tangle around other items in the wash. They can also absorb dirt from the shoes themselves. I usually put my laces in a separate small mesh bag or wash them by hand. This keeps them from getting lost or damaged.

Next, take out the insoles. Insoles often hold a lot of sweat and odor. They also absorb dirt from your feet. Washing them separately allows for a more focused cleaning. You can often hand wash insoles with a mild soap and water. Let them air dry completely before putting them back in the shoes. Removing them also gives the inside of your shoes a chance to get thoroughly cleaned.

### Brushing Off Loose Dirt and Debris

After removing laces and insoles, tackle the loose dirt. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush to gently scrub away any mud, dust, or debris. Pay special attention to the outsole, especially the CloudTec® elements. These grooves can trap small stones and dirt. Removing these coarse particles now prevents them from scratching or damaging your washing machine. It also keeps them from redistributing dirt during the wash cycle.

I like to tap my shoes together outside to dislodge larger clumps of mud. Then, I use a brush to get into the crevices. This pre-cleaning step is vital. It significantly improves the washing machine's ability to clean the shoes. It makes sure you get the best possible result.

### Pre-Treating Stubborn Stains

Some stains need extra attention before washing. If your On Cloud shoes have visible dirt marks, grass stains, or other stubborn spots, pre-treat them. Apply a small amount of mild laundry detergent directly to the stain. You can also use a shoe cleaner or a stain remover that is safe for athletic fabrics. Gently rub the cleaner into the stain with a soft cloth or brush.

Let the pre-treatment sit for about 15-30 minutes. This allows it to break down the grime. Make sure the product is color-safe to avoid discoloration. Pre-treating increases the chances of removing tough stains. This step ensures your shoes come out of the wash looking much cleaner.

## Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings

Selecting the correct washing machine settings is critical when you clean On Cloud shoes in a washing machine. Using the wrong settings can shrink, warp, or otherwise damage your shoes. My goal is always to mimic a gentle hand wash as closely as possible. This approach protects the delicate materials and the unique structure of On Cloud footwear.

You need to consider water temperature, wash cycle, and detergent type. Each choice plays a role in keeping your shoes safe. I always opt for the least aggressive options available. This minimizes stress on the shoe's materials and adhesives. Making these careful choices helps extend the life of your shoes. It also ensures they come out clean without any unwanted surprises. If you are ever unsure about specific machine models, it's worth checking general guides on washing shoes. For example, [how to machine wash shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-machine-wash-shoes) provides general best practices.

### Cold Water: A Must for Shoe Washing

Always use cold water when washing On Cloud shoes. Hot water is a major enemy for most athletic footwear. High temperatures can cause several problems. It can melt the adhesives that hold different parts of the shoe together. This can lead to delamination, where layers of the shoe separate. Hot water can also shrink or warp synthetic materials and mesh fabrics. This will alter the shoe's fit and comfort.

Cold water, on the other hand, is gentle. It cleans effectively without posing these risks. It helps preserve the shoe's original shape and structural integrity. Using cold water is a simple yet vital step to protect your On Cloud shoes.

### Gentle Cycle or Delicate Mode

The wash cycle setting is just as important as the water temperature. Select your washing machine's "gentle," "delicate," or "hand wash" cycle. These cycles use less agitation and a slower spin speed. High agitation can be too harsh for shoes. It can cause them to bang against the drum or each other. This can damage the shoe's structure, tear the mesh, or weaken seams.

The reduced spin speed of a gentle cycle prevents excessive forces. It also helps to prevent waterlogging, which can stretch out materials. Always prioritize the gentlest cycle available. This ensures a safe and thorough cleaning without unnecessary wear and tear on your shoes. If you are specifically looking for the right mode, consider checking [which washing machine mode for shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/which-washing-machine-mode-for-shoes) for more general advice.

### Choosing a Mild Laundry Detergent

The type of detergent you use matters significantly. Opt for a mild, liquid laundry detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, or powder detergents. Powder detergents may not dissolve completely in cold water. This can leave residues on your shoes. Bleach can cause discoloration and weaken fabric fibers. Harsh chemicals can damage synthetic materials.

A small amount of liquid detergent is usually enough. Too much detergent can leave a sticky residue. This residue can attract more dirt later. Look for detergents labeled "gentle" or "for delicates." These are formulated to be kind to fabrics. Using the right detergent helps clean effectively without harming your shoes' materials.

### Adding Old Towels for Cushioning and Balance

This is a clever trick I always use: add a few old towels to the washing machine with your shoes. The towels provide cushioning. They prevent the shoes from banging against the drum or each other. This reduces the risk of damage to both the shoes and the washing machine. The towels also help balance the load. This is especially useful for preventing the machine from becoming unbalanced during the spin cycle.

I use two or three old, dark-colored towels. Dark towels are best to avoid any potential dye transfer to your shoes. This small addition makes a big difference. It ensures a smoother, safer wash. It protects your shoes from excessive impact.

## The Step-by-Step Washing Process

Now that your On Cloud shoes are prepared and you understand the settings, it is time for the actual wash. This process is straightforward but requires attention to detail. My aim is to ensure a thorough clean while keeping your shoes protected. Following these steps will help you achieve the best results without any hassle.

Remember, the goal is gentle cleaning. Avoid anything that feels too aggressive. This approach respects the materials of your On Cloud shoes. It helps them retain their shape and function. I find that a systematic approach reduces the chances of errors. It also provides peace of mind.

### Placing Shoes in a Mesh Laundry Bag

Before loading, place your prepared On Cloud shoes into a mesh laundry bag. This step is non-negotiable for me. The mesh bag acts as a protective barrier. It prevents laces (if you chose to wash them with the shoes) from tangling. It stops shoes from hitting the drum directly. It also keeps small parts, if any, from getting lost or damaged.

I use a sturdy, zippered mesh bag designed for delicates. Make sure the zipper is fully closed to keep the shoes securely inside. If you are washing two shoes, you can usually fit both into one large bag. This simple addition significantly enhances the safety of machine washing your athletic footwear.

### Loading the Washing Machine Correctly

With shoes in their mesh bag and accompanied by old towels, load the washing machine. Distribute the items evenly. Place the shoes and towels around the drum. This helps maintain balance throughout the wash cycle. An unbalanced load can cause the machine to shake excessively. This can potentially damage both the machine and your shoes.

Avoid overloading the machine. Shoes are bulky, and they need room to move freely within the gentle cycle. Overfilling the machine reduces cleaning effectiveness. It also increases the risk of damage. I usually wash one pair of shoes at a time to ensure plenty of space.

### Starting the Gentle Wash Cycle

Once loaded, add your mild liquid detergent to the dispenser. Remember, just a small amount is sufficient. Set the washing machine to the "cold water" temperature. Then, select the "gentle," "delicate," or "hand wash" cycle. Double-check these settings before starting the machine.

Press the start button and let the machine do its work. Resist the urge to open the lid or interfere with the cycle. Let it run its course completely. The gentle agitation and cold water will work to lift dirt and freshen your shoes. For general advice on how long to wash shoes, you can consult resources like [how long to wash shoes in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-to-wash-shoes-in-washing-machine).

### Post-Wash Inspection

Once the wash cycle finishes, immediately remove your shoes from the washing machine. Take them out of the mesh bag. Inspect them closely. Are the stains gone? Do they look clean? Sometimes, very stubborn stains might still be present. If so, a second, targeted spot-clean might be necessary.

Gently reshape the shoes if they appear a bit misshapen. Some light squeezing can help them regain their form. This quick inspection ensures you are satisfied with the results. It also prepares them for the next crucial step: drying.

## Safe Drying Methods for On Cloud Shoes

Drying your On Cloud shoes properly after washing is just as important as the wash cycle itself. This is where many people make a critical mistake. Never put your On Cloud shoes in a machine dryer. High heat is detrimental to the materials and adhesives. It can cause irreversible damage. My golden rule is always air dry.

Air drying preserves the integrity of your shoes. It helps maintain their fit, shape, and performance. This step may take longer than machine drying, but it is worth the wait. Patience here prevents warping, shrinking, or delamination. I always plan for shoes to take at least 24-48 hours to dry completely.

### Air Drying is Crucial: No Machine Dryers

Let me repeat: do not use a machine dryer for your On Cloud shoes. The intense heat from a dryer can melt the glues that bond the shoe's components. It can also shrink the synthetic mesh and overlays. This results in a shoe that is misshapen, uncomfortable, and potentially damaged beyond repair. This applies to most athletic shoes. If you are wondering about the broader implications, you can read more about [can I dry shoes in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-dry-shoes-in-washing-machine).

Instead, opt for natural air drying. This method is slow but gentle. It allows the moisture to evaporate naturally. This protects the delicate balance of materials that make up your On Cloud shoes. It ensures they retain their original form and cushioning properties.

### Tips for Faster Air Drying

While air drying takes time, you can speed up the process slightly. After removing your shoes from the washer, gently blot them with a clean towel. This removes excess surface water. Then, stuff the inside of each shoe with white paper towels or clean, crumpled newspaper. The paper helps absorb moisture from within the shoe. It also helps the shoe retain its shape as it dries.

Change the paper every few hours, or when it feels damp. This helps draw more moisture out. Avoid using colored newspaper as the ink can transfer to your shoes. These simple steps can shave several hours off the drying time.

### Positioning for Even Drying

Place your On Cloud shoes in a well-ventilated area for drying. A spot with good airflow is ideal. Avoid direct sunlight or placing them near a heater. While you want airflow, direct heat can still damage the materials. An indoor spot near an open window or with a fan running is perfect.

I often place my shoes on a drying rack or hang them by the tongue. This allows air to circulate around all sides of the shoe. Ensure both the inside and outside of the shoe get adequate airflow. Flip them periodically to ensure even drying. Complete drying is essential to prevent mildew or unpleasant odors.

### Drying Laces and Insoles Separately

Do not forget your laces and insoles. These items also need to dry completely. You can lay them flat on a clean surface or hang them. Make sure they are in a well-ventilated area, just like your shoes. For insoles, ensure both sides are exposed to air.

Wait until everything is bone dry before reassembling your shoes. Placing damp laces or insoles back into the shoes can lead to odor. It can also encourage bacterial growth. Taking this extra time ensures your entire shoe system is fresh and clean.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

When you clean On Cloud shoes in a washing machine, there are specific mistakes to avoid. These common pitfalls can damage your shoes, shorten their lifespan, or result in an unsatisfactory clean. I have learned these lessons over time. Sharing them helps you prevent similar issues. My goal is for your On Cloud shoes to emerge from the wash looking and feeling great, not ruined.

Awareness is key here. Knowing what *not* to do is as important as knowing what *to* do. Paying attention to these details will ensure your cleaning process is safe and effective. It protects your investment in quality footwear.

### Using Hot Water or Harsh Chemicals

One of the biggest mistakes is using hot water. As I mentioned, hot water can melt adhesives and warp synthetic materials. It can change the shape and comfort of your shoes permanently. Always stick to cold water for washing. Similarly, avoid harsh chemicals like bleach or strong stain removers. These can discolor fabrics, weaken materials, or leave residues. Mild liquid detergents are always the best choice for athletic shoes. Always read product labels to ensure they are safe for delicate fabrics.

### Overloading the Washing Machine

Another common pitfall is overloading the washing machine. When the machine is too full, items cannot move freely. This means your shoes will not get cleaned properly. They also experience more friction and banging against other items. This increases the risk of damage. I always recommend washing one pair of shoes at a time. This ensures plenty of space for the gentle cycle to work effectively. It also prevents imbalance issues in the machine.

### Drying Shoes in a Machine Dryer

This bears repeating: never put your On Cloud shoes in a machine dryer. The heat is simply too intense for the materials. It can cause irreversible damage like shrinking, warping, and adhesive failure. The spinning motion can also be too aggressive. Always choose air drying. It takes more time, but it preserves your shoes. Place them in a well-ventilated area, away from direct heat or sunlight. Stuffing them with paper towels can help absorb moisture and maintain shape.

### Not Using a Mesh Laundry Bag

Washing shoes directly in the machine without a mesh bag is a mistake. The shoes can bang around, potentially damaging themselves or the washing machine. Laces can get tangled. Small parts could catch on the agitator. A sturdy mesh laundry bag provides a protective layer. It keeps the shoes contained and cushions them during the wash. It's a simple, inexpensive tool that offers significant protection.

### Skipping Pre-Treatment for Stains

Thinking the washing machine will magically remove all stains is a common oversight. While the machine helps, stubborn stains often need pre-treatment. Dirt, grass, or grease spots need a little extra attention before the main wash. Applying a mild detergent or stain remover directly to the spot and letting it sit helps break down the grime. Skipping this step often means stains remain visible after the wash. This makes the overall cleaning effort less effective.

## Maintaining Clean On Cloud Shoes Between Washes

Cleaning your On Cloud shoes in a washing machine is great for a deep clean. However, regular maintenance between washes keeps them looking fresh for longer. This reduces the frequency of machine washing. It also extends the overall lifespan of your shoes. My routine helps tackle dirt and odors before they become major issues. Consistent care makes a big difference.

Think of it as preventive maintenance. A little effort often prevents big problems down the road. This strategy keeps your On Cloud shoes ready for action whenever you need them. It saves time and energy in the long run. If you want general tips on how to keep your shoes clean, you can also consult resources like [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean).

### Spot Cleaning Regularly

Do not wait for your shoes to become heavily soiled. Spot clean them after each use, especially if they are visibly dirty. Use a soft brush or a damp cloth to wipe away any fresh mud or dirt. For small marks, a mild soap solution on a cloth works wonders. Tackle spills or smudges immediately. Fresh stains are much easier to remove than old, set-in ones. This quick clean-up prevents dirt from embedding deep into the fabric fibers. It keeps your shoes looking presentable day-to-day.

### Using Protective Sprays

Consider applying a water and stain repellent spray to your On Cloud shoes. These sprays create an invisible barrier on the shoe's surface. This barrier helps repel water, dirt, and stains. It makes future cleaning much easier. Make sure the spray is safe for the specific materials of your On Cloud shoes.

Always test the spray on an inconspicuous area first. This checks for any discoloration. Reapply the spray periodically, following the product's instructions. This protective layer acts as your first line of defense against everyday grime.

### Proper Storage Techniques

How you store your On Cloud shoes also affects their cleanliness and longevity. Keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade colors and degrade materials over time. Avoid storing them in damp environments, like a humid closet. Dampness encourages mold and mildew growth.

If your shoes are a bit damp after a run, let them air out completely before storing them. You can also use shoe trees or stuff them with crumpled paper. This helps them maintain their shape. Proper storage ensures they stay fresh and ready for your next adventure.

### Addressing Odor Proactively

Sweat and bacteria can lead to odors in athletic shoes. To combat this, remove your insoles after particularly sweaty activities. Let them air out separately. You can also sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and insoles overnight. Baking soda is a natural odor absorber. Just shake it out in the morning.

For persistent odors, consider odor-absorbing inserts or sprays designed for shoes. Regular airing and proactive odor control keep your On Cloud shoes smelling fresh. This makes them much more pleasant to wear.

### Knowing When to Machine Wash

While spot cleaning and maintenance are great, there comes a time for a deeper clean. You should machine wash your On Cloud shoes when they are heavily soiled. Wash them when they have absorbed a lot of sweat. Or when they develop persistent odors. The frequency depends on your usage. For active runners, this might be every few months. For casual wear, it could be less often.

Listen to your shoes and your nose. If they feel grimy or smell stale, it is time for a full wash. Follow the gentle machine washing steps outlined earlier. This ensures your On Cloud shoes remain clean and comfortable.

## Frequently Asked Questions
