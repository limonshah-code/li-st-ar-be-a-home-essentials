### Why Leveling Your Whirlpool Refrigerator Matters (Importance of Proper Alignment)

A refrigerator is a heavy and essential appliance in any home. Many people overlook the importance of proper leveling when installing or moving their Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator. Yet, ensuring your refrigerator stands level offers significant benefits for its performance, efficiency, and durability. An unlevel refrigerator can lead to a host of problems that impact both your appliance and your household budget. We can easily prevent these issues with a simple adjustment.

Proper alignment is foundational to your refrigerator's optimal operation. It affects everything from how well the doors seal to how efficiently the cooling system works. Ignoring this simple step can result in wasted energy, noisy operation, and even premature component failure. Taking the time to level your appliance now will save you headaches and expenses in the future.

#### Ensuring Proper Door Seal and Operation

One of the most immediate benefits of a level refrigerator is the assurance of a tight door seal. If your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator is not level, its doors may not close fully or seal properly against the cabinet. This allows cold air to escape, forcing your refrigerator to work harder to maintain its internal temperature. A poor seal not only wastes energy but also causes food to spoil faster.

Proper leveling ensures the doors hang straight and gravity assists them in closing tightly. This prevents constant cold air loss, which can lead to higher electricity bills. An unlevel refrigerator can also cause the doors to swing open or close too quickly, leading to damage to the doors or nearby cabinets over time.

#### Preventing Leaks and Condensation

An unlevel refrigerator can also contribute to problems like water leaks or excessive condensation. The internal drainage system, which handles defrost water, relies on gravity to guide water away from the freezer compartment and into the drain pan. If the refrigerator is tilted incorrectly, this water might pool inside or overflow. This can lead to water accumulating at the bottom of the refrigerator or even leaking onto your floor.

This issue can damage your flooring and create a slip hazard. Excess condensation inside the refrigerator is another sign of poor sealing, often due to an unlevel unit. For more information on this specific issue, you can read about [why your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator is leaking water from the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-whirlpool-side-by-side-refrigerator-leaking-water-from-the-bottom).

#### Optimizing Energy Efficiency and Performance

A level refrigerator runs more efficiently. When the doors seal properly, the compressor does not need to work as hard or as often to maintain the set temperature. This reduces energy consumption, leading to lower utility bills. An efficient refrigerator also experiences less wear and tear on its compressor and other cooling components, which helps extend its overall lifespan.

An unlevel refrigerator can also cause internal parts, like the ice maker, to malfunction. For instance, if the ice maker's water line or drainage is skewed, it might not produce ice correctly or could cause a mess.

### Tools and Materials Needed for Leveling

Before you begin the leveling process for your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator, gather all the necessary tools. Having everything ready will make the job quicker and smoother. Most of these items are common household tools, so you likely already own them. You do not need specialized equipment to achieve a perfectly level appliance.

Preparing your workspace and having the right tools on hand ensures safety and efficiency. It also helps prevent frustration during the adjustment process. Make sure to clear the area around the refrigerator before you start.

#### Essential Tools for Accurate Measurement

The most important tool for leveling is a reliable level. A carpenter's level, typically 2 to 3 feet long, works best. This length helps you check the level across the entire width and depth of the refrigerator. You can use a smaller torpedo level for more precise checks on individual sections or corners. Some people even use a smartphone app for leveling, but a physical level offers more accuracy.

You will use this tool to verify that the refrigerator is plumb from side to side and slightly tilted backward. An accurate reading ensures your adjustments lead to the desired stability and door closure. Always trust your physical level over a visual estimate.

#### Adjusting Mechanisms: Wrenches and Pliers

Your Whirlpool refrigerator has adjustable leveling legs, usually found at the front bottom corners. You will need a wrench to turn these legs. The size of the wrench can vary, but a 1/2-inch or 9/16-inch open-end wrench or an adjustable crescent wrench usually works. Some models might have hex-head leveling screws that require a socket wrench.

For models with rollers at the back, you might need a flat-head screwdriver or a hex-head screwdriver to adjust them. Pliers can also be helpful for gripping stubborn nuts or turning the legs if they are tight. Always use the right size tool to avoid stripping the nuts or damaging the leveling components.

#### Additional Helpful Items

Consider having a flashlight handy. This will help you see clearly under the refrigerator, especially when locating and adjusting the rear rollers or leveling screws. A sturdy pair of work gloves can protect your hands from scrapes or sharp edges as you reach under the appliance. Shims made of wood or plastic might be useful if your floor is very uneven and the built-in leveling legs cannot fully compensate.

Finally, having a helper is always a good idea, especially when tilting or moving the heavy Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator. While leveling can be a solo job, an extra set of hands makes it safer and easier.

### Locating the Leveling Components on Your Whirlpool Side-by-Side

Before you can adjust your Whirlpool refrigerator, you need to know where its leveling components are located. Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerators typically have adjustable leveling legs at the front. They may also have non-adjustable rollers or adjustable leveling screws at the rear. Understanding the location and function of each component is key to successful leveling.

These components are designed to allow you to raise or lower specific corners of the refrigerator. This helps compensate for uneven flooring. Familiarizing yourself with these parts will make the adjustment process much clearer and simpler.

#### Front Leveling Legs and Rollers

Your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator will have two adjustable leveling legs at the bottom front corners. These legs are usually visible from the front or just behind the kick plate (grille) at the bottom. The kick plate may need to be removed to access them easily. This grille usually snaps off or is held by a few screws. Once removed, you will see the adjustable legs, often with a large screw or nut that can be turned.

In addition to the legs, many models also have front rollers. These rollers allow you to move the refrigerator for cleaning or relocation. The leveling legs are designed to bear the weight and keep the refrigerator stable, preventing it from rolling freely once positioned. Some models might integrate the leveling function directly into the rollers.

#### Rear Rollers and Leveling Screws

The rear of most Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerators typically has non-adjustable rollers. These rollers are primarily for moving the appliance. However, some Whirlpool models might feature adjustable leveling screws or feet at the rear. These are usually less common than front adjustments. If your model has rear adjusters, they might be accessible from the front by tilting the refrigerator forward slightly, or you might need to reach around the back.

The primary purpose of the rear rollers, even if not adjustable for height, is to allow the refrigerator to be slightly tilted backward. This slight backward tilt is crucial for ensuring the doors swing shut under their own weight and seal properly. We achieve this tilt by raising the front of the refrigerator slightly higher than the back, using the front leveling legs.

#### Understanding Anti-Tip Brackets (If Applicable)

Some Whirlpool refrigerators, especially taller or heavier models, might come with anti-tip brackets. These brackets are safety devices designed to prevent the refrigerator from tipping forward when the doors are opened or drawers are pulled out. While not directly part of the leveling mechanism, they are important for stability. Anti-tip brackets are usually installed on the wall or floor behind the refrigerator.

If your refrigerator has these, ensure they are properly engaged after leveling. Although they do not adjust the level, they contribute to the overall stability and safety of the appliance. Always prioritize safety when working with heavy appliances.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Leveling the Front of Your Refrigerator

Leveling the front of your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator is the primary step in achieving stability and proper door alignment. This process is straightforward and typically involves adjusting the two front leveling legs. You will need your wrench and a level for this part. Take your time with each step to ensure accuracy.

A properly leveled front ensures the appliance rests firmly on the floor without wobbling. It also sets the stage for fine-tuning the door closure later. This is where most of your leveling efforts will focus.

#### Preparing the Area and Accessing Front Legs

First, carefully pull your Whirlpool refrigerator out from the wall. You only need to pull it out enough to comfortably access the front bottom corners. Unplug the refrigerator from the wall outlet for safety before you begin any adjustments. This prevents accidental power cycling or electrical hazards.

Next, locate the kick plate, or grille, at the very bottom front of the refrigerator. Most Whirlpool models have a removable kick plate that conceals the leveling legs. This plate usually snaps off by pulling gently, or it may be held in place by a few screws. Use a screwdriver to remove any screws, then carefully pull the plate away. You will then see the two front leveling legs, one on each side.

#### Adjusting Legs for Height and Stability

Now, use your wrench to adjust the front leveling legs. Turning the leg clockwise will raise that corner of the refrigerator. Turning it counter-clockwise will lower it. The goal here is to make the refrigerator level from side to side. Place your carpenter's level across the top front edge of the refrigerator, from left to right. Adjust one leg at a time, checking the level frequently. Raise the lower side until the bubble in the level is centered.

Once the refrigerator is level from side to side, you also want to ensure it has a slight backward tilt. This tilt helps the doors swing shut and seal properly. To achieve this, slightly raise both front legs an equal amount. The front should be about 1/4 to 1/2 inch higher than the back. This subtle tilt ensures gravity assists with door closure.

#### Checking Level and Door Alignment

After adjusting the front legs, place your level on top of the refrigerator from front to back, then check it side to side again. The side-to-side reading should be perfectly level. The front-to-back reading should show a slight tilt towards the back. Now, open and close both refrigerator doors. They should close smoothly and seal tightly without needing an extra push.

If the doors are still not closing properly, you might need to make small, incremental adjustments to the front legs. Remember, a slight backward tilt is key for the doors. You might also want to check the overall stability by gently rocking the refrigerator. It should feel solid and not wobble. If your refrigerator is not performing as expected even after leveling, you might need to consider other fixes.

### Adjusting the Rear of Your Whirlpool Refrigerator (If Necessary)

While most Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator leveling is handled by the front legs, some models may have adjustable rear components. These are typically less common or are designed for fine-tuning the backward tilt. Understanding how to access and adjust them, if present, can help you achieve perfect stability and door closure. This step is usually only needed if the front adjustments alone do not provide the desired tilt or stability.

It is important to remember that the primary goal for the rear is usually to maintain the slight backward tilt. You often achieve this by raising the front. However, some specific models might offer direct rear adjustments.

#### Tilting the Refrigerator for Rear Access

If your Whirlpool model has adjustable rear rollers or leveling screws, accessing them often requires tilting the refrigerator. With a helper, carefully tilt the refrigerator forward, leaning it slightly onto its front feet or a sturdy piece of wood placed underneath. This will lift the rear of the refrigerator off the floor, exposing the rear rollers or screws. Be very careful during this step to prevent the refrigerator from tipping too far.

Alternatively, some Whirlpool models have rear leveling screws that can be adjusted from the front. You might need to reach a long screwdriver or wrench under the front of the refrigerator to engage them. Consult your owner's manual for specific instructions regarding your model's rear adjustment mechanisms. It will provide the most accurate method for access.

#### Fine-Tuning Rear Roller Screws

If you have located adjustable rear leveling screws, you can use a screwdriver or wrench to turn them. Similar to the front legs, turning clockwise will raise that corner, and counter-clockwise will lower it. These adjustments are usually for fine-tuning the backward tilt or to ensure all four corners are making contact with the floor. You typically adjust them in conjunction with the front legs.

The goal is to maintain the slight backward tilt (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch higher at the front). If the refrigerator is rocking from a specific rear corner, you can slightly extend that rear screw to stabilize it. Always re-check the level from front to back and ensure the doors still close properly after making any rear adjustments. The rear adjustments contribute to overall stability.

### Checking Door Alignment and Final Adjustments

Once you have adjusted the leveling legs and rollers, the final step is to meticulously check your refrigerator doors. Proper door alignment is critical for maintaining cold temperatures and preventing energy waste. Even if your refrigerator appears level, the doors might still need a little fine-tuning. This phase ensures your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator is not only stable but also fully functional in terms of its most frequently used components.

Take your time during this step. Small adjustments here can make a big difference in daily use and long-term efficiency. Do not rush the final checks.

#### Verifying Door Closure and Seal

Begin by opening both the refrigerator and freezer doors about halfway. Then, let them go. Both doors should gently swing shut on their own and seal tightly against the refrigerator frame. If a door stays ajar, swings open wider, or does not seal completely, further adjustments are needed. Run your hand around the door gasket once the door is closed. You should not feel any cold air escaping. This indicates a good seal.

If the doors are not closing fully, it might mean the refrigerator is not tilted back enough. Slightly raise the front leveling legs more. If one door closes faster or slower than the other, you may need to adjust the leveling leg on that specific side. Slight variations in floor height can cause these minor discrepancies.

#### Addressing Misaligned Doors

Sometimes, even after leveling the refrigerator, the doors might appear uneven at the top or bottom, or one door might rub against the other. This usually points to issues with the door hinges rather than the leveling itself. Many Whirlpool side-by-side models have adjustable door hinges. These adjustments allow you to raise, lower, or shift the doors horizontally.

Consult your ownerâ€™s manual for specific instructions on adjusting your modelâ€™s door hinges. It might involve loosening screws on the top or middle hinges and repositioning the door. Make small adjustments, then re-check the alignment until both doors are perfectly even and close without interference. This is a separate step from leveling but vital for aesthetics and function.

#### Final Stability Check

After all adjustments are made and the doors are perfectly aligned, give your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator a final stability check. Gently push and pull on the top corners of the appliance. It should feel solid and not rock or wobble at all. If there is any movement, revisit the leveling legs and make tiny adjustments until the refrigerator stands perfectly still.

Also, check under the refrigerator to ensure the leveling legs are firmly making contact with the floor. If a leg is suspended or not bearing weight, it means the refrigerator is rocking on fewer than four points, which can lead to instability and noise. Replace the kick plate once you are satisfied with the stability and door operation.

### Troubleshooting Common Leveling Issues and Maintenance Tips

Even with the best intentions, you might encounter some common issues while leveling your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator. Do not get discouraged if it is not perfect on the first try. Troubleshooting these problems is often straightforward. Additionally, knowing how to maintain your refrigerator's levelness over time can save you future hassle.

Proper maintenance contributes to the overall lifespan and efficiency of your appliance. A little preventive care goes a long way. Let us explore some common scenarios and solutions.

#### Persistent Wobble or Instability

If your Whirlpool refrigerator still wobbles after you have tried to level it, there could be a few reasons. First, reconfirm that all four contact points (two front leveling legs and two rear rollers/feet) are firmly on the floor and bearing weight. Sometimes, a floor can be so uneven that the built-in leveling legs cannot compensate enough. In such cases, you may need to use shims under the rear rollers or the lowest leveling leg.

Wooden or plastic shims can be placed directly under the non-adjustable rollers at the back to raise that side slightly. For front legs, extend the leg as much as possible, and if it still does not reach the floor or is unstable, place a shim underneath it. Ensure the shims are stable and do not shift. Another cause for wobble could be loose anti-tip brackets if your model has them. Check these for proper engagement.

#### Doors Still Not Closing Properly

If your refrigerator doors are still not closing or sealing correctly despite your leveling efforts, revisit the backward tilt. The front of the refrigerator should be slightly higher than the back (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch). This slight tilt is crucial for gravity to pull the doors shut. If the doors swing open, try raising the front leveling legs a bit more.

If the doors are rubbing or misaligned visually, the issue might be with the door hinges themselves rather than the refrigerator's level. Most Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerators have adjustable door hinges. You can usually find small hex bolts or Phillips screws on the hinges that allow for vertical or horizontal adjustments. Consult your owner's manual for specific hinge adjustment instructions. This will help you perfectly align the doors so they do not sag or rub.

#### Routine Checks and Maintenance

Leveling your refrigerator is not a one-time task, especially if you live in a house where floors might settle. It is a good practice to check your Whirlpool refrigerator's level periodically, perhaps once a year or if you notice any new issues like a wobbly appliance or doors not closing. This simple check can prevent minor issues from becoming major problems.

While checking the level, take the opportunity to perform other essential maintenance. For instance, cleaning under your refrigerator is important. Dust and debris can accumulate under the unit, affecting airflow and even causing the leveling legs to seize up. Our guide on [how to clean under a refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-under-a-refrigerator) offers detailed steps for this task. Also, check that the leveling legs are not corroded or rusted, which can make them difficult to adjust. A little maintenance ensures your appliance runs smoothly and efficiently.
