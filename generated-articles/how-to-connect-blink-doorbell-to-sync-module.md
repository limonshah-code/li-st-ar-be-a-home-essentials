These are specific areas within the camera's view that you want to monitor for motion. Exclude areas like busy sidewalks or swaying trees. This reduces unwanted notifications. Experiment with these settings to find the right balance for your home.

#### Privacy Zones

Privacy is important. Blink doorbells offer privacy zones. These are areas within the camera's view that you want to exclude from recording. For example, a neighbor's window or a public walkway. You can draw these zones in the Blink app. Any activity within a privacy zone will not trigger recording. This ensures you respect privacy while still monitoring your property. It also helps comply with local privacy laws. Setting these zones is simple. Go to your doorbell's settings in the app. Find "Privacy Zones" and draw the areas you wish to mask.

#### Chime Settings

Your Blink Doorbell offers various chime options. If you connected it to existing doorbell wiring, your indoor chime should ring. If you are using it wirelessly, the Blink app acts as your chime. You will receive notifications on your phone. You can also pair it with an Alexa-enabled device. This allows your Echo device to announce when someone is at the door. To link your doorbell with an Echo Show, you can find detailed steps on [how to link Blink doorbell with Echo Show](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-link-blink-doorbell-with-echo-show). This integration gives you audible alerts. In the app settings, you can adjust notification sounds. You can choose different tones for button presses and motion alerts. This customization helps you differentiate alerts.

Sometimes, a simple router reboot fixes connectivity issues. Fourth, if the issue persists, you might need to re-add the Sync Module to your Wi-Fi network through the Blink app. This is similar to the initial setup process. Ensure your Wi-Fi password has not changed.

#### Doorbell Not Notifying Me

If your Blink doorbell is not sending notifications, check a few settings. First, verify that notifications are enabled in the Blink Home Monitor app for your doorbell. Go to your doorbell's settings and ensure "Motion Detection" and "Doorbell Press" alerts are active. Second, check your phone's notification settings for the Blink app. Ensure the app has permission to send notifications. Sometimes, the phone's operating system restricts app notifications. Third, ensure your Sync Module is online and connected. If it's offline, no notifications will be sent. If you have experience with other smart doorbells, you might compare this to when a [Ring doorbell is not notifying you](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-ring-doorbell-not-notifying-me). The underlying issues are often similar, relating to app settings, connectivity, or device status.
