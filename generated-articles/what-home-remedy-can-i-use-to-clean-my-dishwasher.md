### Cleaning the Dishwasher Filter

The dishwasher filter traps food particles. It prevents them from recirculating onto your dishes. A clogged filter reduces cleaning power. It also causes bad smells.

1.  **Locate and remove:** Most filters are in the bottom of the dishwasher. Consult your appliance manual. Twist or unclip the filter to remove it.
2.  **Rinse under water:** Rinse the filter under warm running water. Use a gentle stream to dislodge loose debris.

Cleaning the filter regularly, perhaps monthly, makes a big difference. It prevents clogs and odors. This simple step keeps your dishwasher running smoothly.

### Maintaining Spray Arm Performance

The spray arms distribute water and detergent. They have small holes. These holes can become clogged with mineral deposits or food particles. Clogged spray arms mean uneven washing. Your dishes will not get clean.

Clear spray arms ensure full water coverage. This leads to cleaner dishes. It is a vital part of dishwasher maintenance.

### Caring for Door Seals and Gaskets

The rubber seals around the dishwasher door keep water inside. They often trap food particles, grease, and moisture. This creates a perfect environment for mold and mildew. These areas contribute significantly to bad odors.

2.  **Prepare a cleaning solution:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle.

Using natural rinse aids is safe for your dishes and your appliance. It is also an eco-friendly choice. You get sparkling dishes without chemical residues.

### Addressing Minor Issues Promptly

Ignoring small problems leads to bigger ones. If you notice a faint odor, address it immediately.

*   **Spot clean:** Wipe down visible spills or food debris as soon as you see them. Use a damp cloth. A little vinegar or baking soda on the cloth works wonders.
*   **Check the filter:** If dishes are not coming out clean, check the filter first. It might be clogged.
