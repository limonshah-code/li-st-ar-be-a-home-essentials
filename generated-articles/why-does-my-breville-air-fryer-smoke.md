## Why Does My Breville Air Fryer Smoke: Quick Fixes & Safety Tips

Finding smoke coming from your Breville air fryer can be alarming. You are not alone if you have experienced this issue. Many air fryer owners face smoking problems. It often indicates a simple fix rather than a serious malfunction. Understanding the common causes helps you quickly solve the problem. This guide will help you identify why your Breville air fryer smokes. We will also provide clear steps to prevent it and keep your kitchen safe.

### Takeaway: Stopping Air Fryer Smoke

*   Clean your air fryer regularly to remove food debris and grease.
*   Avoid overfilling the basket.
*   Use less oil, or choose high-smoke-point oils.
*   Cook high-fat foods carefully, perhaps using parchment paper.
*   Perform a burn-off cycle for new air fryers.
*   Inspect for damaged components if problems persist.

A Breville air fryer smokes most often due to food residue, grease buildup, or cooking high-fat foods. It can also happen if the appliance is new. Regular cleaning and correct cooking practices usually stop the smoke.

### Understanding Why Your Breville Air Fryer Smokes

Your Breville air fryer works by circulating hot air. This process cooks food fast and makes it crispy. When smoke appears, it means something is burning. This is usually food particles or oil that has splattered. Understanding how your air fryer heats helps explain why this happens.

Air fryers get very hot inside. This high heat can quickly burn anything left behind. A small crumb from a previous meal can smoke if it gets too hot. I have seen this happen with my own air fryer. It creates an unpleasant smell and can trigger smoke alarms.

It is important to know that a little bit of steam is normal. Steam comes from the moisture in your food. This looks like a thin, wispy vapor. Smoke is thicker, darker, and smells like burning. Learning to tell the difference is a good first step.

The design of Breville air fryers allows efficient air flow. This also means any burning residue will quickly cause smoke. It is a sign that something needs attention. We will look at specific reasons and how to fix them in the next sections.

### The Culprit: Food Residue and Grease Buildup

The most common reason for a smoking Breville air fryer is food residue. Tiny bits of food can stick to the heating element or the basket. These bits burn when you preheat or cook. This causes smoke and a burnt smell.

Grease buildup is another major cause. Oil from previous meals can accumulate. It collects in the basket or on other surfaces. This old grease will burn when heated. It produces a lot of smoke.

#### How Food Particles Cause Smoke

Imagine crumbs falling off fries or chicken wings. These small pieces drop below the cooking basket. They land on the bottom of the air fryer or on the heating coils. When the air fryer turns on, these crumbs get super hot. They char and burn, sending smoke into your kitchen.

This is why regular cleaning is so important. I always make sure to brush out any loose bits after cooking. Ignoring these small pieces can lead to bigger smoking issues. Always check the heating element too, as crumbs can stick there.

#### Tackling Grease Accumulation

Grease builds up over time, especially when cooking fatty foods. It coats the basket, the tray, and even the inside walls. This layer of old oil becomes carbonized when heated. It burns and releases smoke. This smoke often has a strong, acrid smell.

Cleaning your air fryer thoroughly prevents this. You need to clean the basket, the drawer, and the inside. Regular deep cleaning helps a lot. I found this makes a big difference in preventing smoke.

### Overfilling and Improper Food Placement

Putting too much food into your Breville air fryer can cause smoke. The appliance needs space for hot air to circulate. Overfilling blocks this air flow. It makes some parts of the food cook unevenly.

When food is too crowded, it also leads to more drippings. These drippings can fall directly onto the heating element. This causes immediate burning and smoke. It also makes your food less crispy.

#### Why Less is More for Air Fryers

Air fryers cook by convection. Hot air moves all around your food. Each piece needs room to get crispy. If you pack the basket, the air cannot reach everything. This traps moisture and makes food soggy.

Crowding also increases the chance of oil dripping. When food is piled high, oil has more surfaces to drip from. It is best to cook in smaller batches. This ensures even cooking and less smoke. I always aim for a single layer of food whenever possible.

#### Correct Placement for Smoke-Free Cooking

Proper food placement is key. Spread your food in a single layer if you can. If you must stack, do it loosely. Make sure air can still flow between the pieces. This helps prevent oil from pooling and burning.

Also, place fattier parts of food away from direct heat. If cooking chicken with skin, position it so the skin isn't directly above the heating coil. This reduces direct oil drips. Using parchment paper can also catch drippings and prevent smoke.

### High-Fat Foods and Cooking Temperatures

Cooking foods high in fat can cause a Breville air fryer to smoke. When fat heats up, it melts and drips. This melted fat can reach the heating element. It then burns and creates smoke. Foods like bacon, sausages, or fatty cuts of meat are common culprits.

Using too much oil, or the wrong type of oil, can also be an issue. Some oils have a low smoke point. This means they burn at lower temperatures. When these oils are used in a hot air fryer, they smoke quickly. It is important to choose oils suitable for high-heat cooking.

#### Managing High-Fat Ingredients

When cooking fatty foods, anticipate the drippings. I often place a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil in the bottom of the basket. Make sure it does not block air flow around the food. This catches the fat before it burns on the heating element. You can also use a small amount of water in the drawer below the basket. This helps cool the drippings and prevents them from smoking.

For very fatty items, you might need to empty the excess grease during cooking. Pause the air fryer. Carefully pull out the drawer and pour out any accumulated fat. This reduces the amount of oil that can burn. This little step makes a big difference for me.

#### Choosing the Right Oils and Temperatures

Not all oils are equal for air frying. Extra virgin olive oil, for example, has a low smoke point. It burns easily at air frying temperatures. I always recommend using oils with a high smoke point.

Good choices include:
*   Avocado oil
*   Grapeseed oil
*   Canola oil
*   Peanut oil

These oils can withstand the high heat of an air fryer without smoking. Always use just a light spray or toss your food with a small amount of oil. Too much oil, even high-smoke-point oil, can still cause smoke. Also, follow recipe temperatures closely. Cooking at excessive temperatures can cause oils and food to burn faster.

### Initial Use: New Appliance Smoke

Sometimes, a new Breville air fryer might smoke during its first few uses. This is usually nothing to worry about. Manufacturers often apply a protective coating to heating elements. This coating prevents rust during shipping and storage. When the air fryer heats up for the first time, this coating burns off.

The smoke from a new appliance usually smells like plastic or chemicals. It should go away after the first one or two uses. This process is called a "burn-off" or "seasoning" cycle. It prepares your air fryer for regular use.

#### Performing a Burn-Off Cycle

Before cooking any food in a new Breville air fryer, perform a burn-off cycle. This helps to eliminate any manufacturing residues. Follow these simple steps:

1.  Place the empty air fryer basket back into the unit.
2.  Set the temperature to the highest setting, usually around 400°F (200°C).
3.  Set the timer for 10-15 minutes.
4.  Run the air fryer in a well-ventilated area. Open windows or turn on your kitchen exhaust fan.
5.  Allow the cycle to complete. Some smoke and odor are normal during this time.
6.  Once cooled, wipe down the inside with a damp cloth.

I always do this with any new appliance that uses a heating element. It gives me peace of mind before cooking. This ensures that any unpleasant smells or smoke are gone before food goes in.

#### When New Appliance Smoke Persists

If your new Breville air fryer continues to smoke after several burn-off cycles, there might be another issue. Persistent smoke indicates something more than just initial residue. It could be an internal component problem. In such cases, stop using the appliance. Contact Breville customer support.

Refer to your air fryer's manual for specific instructions on initial use. The manual often contains important safety information. It also provides guidance on troubleshooting common problems. Do not ignore persistent smoke, as it can indicate a safety concern.

### Dealing with Component Issues or Malfunctions

While less common, sometimes smoke from your Breville air fryer points to a malfunction. This can involve the heating element itself or other internal parts. Wires can short-circuit, or components can wear out. If you have ruled out food residue and grease as the cause, then consider internal issues.

Signs of a malfunction include:
*   Smoke that smells electrical or metallic.
*   Smoke that appears even when the air fryer is clean and empty.
*   Unusual noises or sparks coming from the unit.
*   The air fryer not heating up correctly.

If you suspect a malfunction, stop using the air fryer immediately. Do not try to fix internal electrical issues yourself. It can be dangerous.

#### Inspecting for Damage

You can do a visual check of your air fryer. Unplug the unit first. Look at the heating element. Is it visibly damaged? Are there any loose wires? Check the fan area for obstructions. Sometimes a small piece of plastic or a foreign object can melt and cause smoke.

Look for signs of warping or discoloration on plastic parts. Any unusual smell from the appliance itself, not related to food, is a red flag. If you see any signs of damage, do not plug the air fryer back in.

#### Contacting Breville Support

If you suspect a component issue, contact Breville customer support. Provide them with details about the smoke and any other symptoms. They can offer specific troubleshooting steps. They may also arrange for repair or replacement if the unit is under warranty.

Remember, safety comes first. Do not operate a faulty appliance. Ignoring electrical issues can lead to hazards. Breville products are known for quality. However, any appliance can develop problems over time. Always prioritize your safety and seek professional help. This applies whether your Breville is new or has been in use for a while.

### Effective Cleaning Strategies to Prevent Smoking

Cleaning is the best defense against a smoking Breville air fryer. Regular cleaning removes the food residue and grease that cause smoke. It also keeps your air fryer working efficiently. I make sure to clean mine after almost every use. This simple habit prevents many problems.

A thorough cleaning involves more than just washing the basket. You need to clean the interior and the heating element. Ignoring these areas means smoke will eventually return. Make cleaning a routine part of your air fryer maintenance.

#### Daily Cleaning Habits

After each use, let your Breville air fryer cool down. Once cool, remove the basket and wash it with warm, soapy water. A soft sponge works well. You can also put some Breville air fryer baskets in the dishwasher. Check your manual to be sure, or consult our article [can you put Breville air fryer basket in dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-breville-air-fryer-basket-in-dishwasher). Wipe down the interior of the air fryer. Use a damp cloth to remove any splatters or crumbs. This quick wipe-down prevents build-up.

For sticky messes, you can soak the basket. Fill it with hot soapy water for a few minutes. This helps loosen stuck-on food. I use a small brush to get into corners and crevices. This prevents tiny bits of food from hardening.

#### Deep Cleaning for Stubborn Grease

Every few weeks, perform a deep clean. This targets the tougher grease and grime.

1.  **Unplug the air fryer.** Always do this before deep cleaning.
2.  **Remove the basket and tray.** Wash them thoroughly. You can use a degreaser if needed.
3.  **Clean the interior.** Use a damp cloth with a mild dish soap solution. Wipe down all surfaces. For stubborn grease, a paste of baking soda and water works wonders. Apply it, let it sit, then wipe clean.
4.  **Clean the heating element.** This is crucial. Use a soft brush or a damp cloth to gently wipe around the heating coil. Be careful not to damage it. Do not spray water directly onto the element.
5.  **Dry completely.** Ensure all parts are dry before reassembling. Moisture can cause issues.
