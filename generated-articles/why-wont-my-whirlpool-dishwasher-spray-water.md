## Whirlpool Dishwasher Not Spraying Water? Here's Why!

Is your Whirlpool dishwasher leaving your dishes dirty after a full cycle? I understand the frustration. Nothing feels worse than opening the dishwasher door and seeing dried food on your plates. A common problem many people face is their Whirlpool dishwasher not spraying water. This issue directly affects the cleaning performance.

This article explores the primary reasons why your appliance fails to spray water. We will cover everything from simple clogs to more involved component failures. I will guide you through easy troubleshooting steps. You will learn how to identify the specific cause. This information helps you decide if a DIY fix is possible or if you need professional help. Let's get your Whirlpool dishwasher spraying and cleaning again.

### Takeaway

If your Whirlpool dishwasher does not spray water, check these areas first:

*   **Water Supply:** Ensure the dishwasher receives adequate water pressure and volume.
*   **Spray Arms:** Look for clogs in the spray arm holes.
*   **Filters and Sump:** Clean any food debris from the filter and sump area.
*   **Circulation Pump:** Listen for the pump working; it pushes water to the spray arms.
*   **Diverter Valve:** This directs water to the correct spray arm.
*   **Door Latch/Switches:** The machine needs to sense the door is closed.

A Whirlpool dishwasher fails to spray water due to issues with water supply, clogged spray arms or filters, a faulty circulation pump, a malfunctioning diverter valve, or problems with the door latch and related switches. Addressing these components helps restore proper water spray and cleaning performance.

## Initial Checks and Water Supply Issues for Your Whirlpool Dishwasher

When your Whirlpool dishwasher fails to spray water, the first step is to check the basics. Sometimes, the problem is not with the machine's internal parts. It could be an external water supply issue. I always start here because these fixes are often quick and simple. You can easily perform these checks yourself.

### Checking the Water Supply

Your dishwasher needs a constant supply of water to operate. It cannot spray water if it does not receive any. Begin by checking the water valve connected to your dishwasher. This valve is typically under the sink. Make sure it is fully open. A partially closed valve restricts water flow. Also, inspect the water inlet hose for kinks or damage. A bent hose stops water from reaching the dishwasher.

Next, consider the house's main water pressure. Low water pressure in your home affects all water-using appliances. Try running a faucet in your kitchen sink. Observe the water flow. If the pressure seems low, consult your municipal water provider or a plumber. A common symptom of a water supply problem is the dishwasher filling very slowly, or not at all. If your Whirlpool dishwasher fills with water, but doesn't spray, this section might still be relevant to overall flow issues. For more details on water supply, you can read [Why won't my Whirlpool dishwasher fill with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-fill-with-water).

### Inspecting the Water Inlet Valve

The water inlet valve is an important component. It controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. This valve is an electrical component. It opens when it receives power from the control board. If the valve is defective, it might not open properly. This prevents water from entering the machine. You might hear a buzzing sound if the valve is trying to open but fails.

To check the water inlet valve, first turn off power to the dishwasher at the circuit breaker. Locate the valve, usually at the bottom front of the dishwasher. Disconnect the water supply line. Use a multimeter to test the valve's solenoid for continuity. If there is no continuity, the valve is faulty. It needs replacement. Sometimes, debris clogs the small screen on the valve. This also restricts water flow. Clean this screen carefully if you find it blocked.

## Clogged Spray Arms and Filtration System

After confirming your Whirlpool dishwasher receives water, the next area to investigate is the spray arms and the filtration system. These components are directly responsible for directing and filtering the water. Over time, food particles and mineral deposits can build up. This accumulation prevents water from spraying properly. A good cleaning often resolves these issues.

### Inspecting and Cleaning Spray Arms

Your Whirlpool dishwasher has at least two spray arms: an upper and a lower one. Some models have a middle spray arm as well. These arms have small holes designed to spray water at high pressure. Food debris, like small seeds or rice grains, easily clogs these holes. When the holes are blocked, water cannot exit with force. This reduces the spray power or stops it entirely.

To check the spray arms, remove them from the dishwasher. They usually twist or unclip off easily. Hold them up to a light source. Look through each hole. Use a toothpick or a small wire to clear any obstructions. You can also run water through the spray arm in your sink to ensure all holes are clear. If you find significant mineral buildup, soaking the spray arms in vinegar helps dissolve it. Regular cleaning of your spray arms is a good preventive measure.

### Cleaning the Dishwasher Filter and Sump

The filtration system captures food particles. This prevents them from recirculating and clogging the pump or spray arms. Most Whirlpool dishwashers have a removable filter assembly at the bottom of the tub. This filter often consists of two parts: a coarse filter and a fine filter. If these filters become excessively dirty, they restrict water flow to the wash pump. This directly impacts the spray performance.

To clean the filter, twist and lift it out from the bottom of the dishwasher. Rinse both filter parts under running water. Use a soft brush to scrub away stubborn food debris and grease. I sometimes use a little dish soap to help with the grease. Make sure all food particles are gone. Also, clean the sump area where the filter sits. This area collects debris that bypasses the filter. A clogged sump restricts water intake for the circulation pump. This also prevents water from getting sprayed.

## Problems with the Circulation Pump (Wash Pump)

Once you confirm water enters the dishwasher and spray arms are clear, focus on the circulation pump. This component is the heart of your dishwasher's spraying action. The circulation pump, also known as the wash pump, moves water through the spray arms. If it malfunctions, your Whirlpool dishwasher will fill with water but will not spray. This is a very common reason for no spray.

### Understanding the Circulation Pump's Role

The circulation pump draws water from the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It then forces this water under pressure through the spray arm supply lines. Without a working circulation pump, the water just sits in the bottom of the tub. It cannot reach the spray arms. You should hear a distinct humming sound when the pump is running during a wash cycle. If you only hear the water filling, but no further sound of powerful water movement, the pump might be the issue.

### Diagnosing a Faulty Circulation Pump

A faulty circulation pump manifests in several ways. The motor might be burned out. The impeller, which is the part that moves the water, could be broken or jammed. Sometimes, a piece of glass or a small bone can get past the filter and jam the impeller. To check this, you usually need to access the pump from under the dishwasher. Ensure power is off at the circuit breaker first. You can often feel the impeller to see if it spins freely.

You can also use a multimeter to test the pump motor for continuity. A lack of continuity indicates an electrical problem within the motor. Replacing a circulation pump is a more involved repair. It often requires removing the dishwasher from its cabinet and tilting it. If you suspect the circulation pump, and your Whirlpool dishwasher fills with water but does not wash, this is very likely the cause. Learn more about this type of issue by reading [Why does my Whirlpool dishwasher fill with water but not wash](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-fill-with-water-but-not-wash). If you are not comfortable with this repair, calling a professional is a good idea.

## Diverter Valve Malfunctions

Another important part that impacts water distribution is the diverter valve. This valve is specific to certain dishwasher models. It helps direct the water flow to different spray arms at different times during the wash cycle. For instance, it might send water to the lower spray arm for part of the cycle, then switch to the upper spray arm. If this valve sticks or fails, some or all of your spray arms might not receive water.

### How the Diverter Valve Works

The diverter valve is usually located near the circulation pump. It has a motor or solenoid that controls its position. This allows it to redirect the water path. The control board sends signals to the diverter valve. It tells the valve when to switch water flow. For example, during a heavy wash, it might prioritize the lower spray arm. Then, it might shift flow to the upper arm for more delicate items. A properly working diverter valve ensures even water distribution throughout the dishwasher tub. This leads to cleaner dishes on both racks.

### Identifying and Addressing Diverter Valve Issues

Symptoms of a faulty diverter valve often include only one spray arm working, or no spray at all from certain areas. You might notice dishes on the top rack are still dirty while those on the bottom are clean, or vice versa. The valve might get stuck in one position. This prevents water from reaching other areas. Sometimes, food debris can jam the valve. Other times, the motor that operates the valve fails.

Checking the diverter valve typically requires accessing the pump assembly area. You might need to check the electrical connections to the valve motor. Use a multimeter to test for continuity or resistance, depending on the valve type. If the motor is burnt out or the valve is physically stuck, it will need replacement. This repair often involves disassembling parts of the wash pump housing. If you are not familiar with appliance repairs, this is another component where professional help might be necessary.

## Faulty Door Latch, Switches, and Sensors

For your Whirlpool dishwasher to spray water, it must first start and detect certain conditions. The door latch, various switches, and some sensors play a critical safety role. They ensure the dishwasher operates only when safe. If any of these components malfunction, the dishwasher might not start a cycle, or it might not spray water even if it fills.

### The Role of the Door Latch and Door Switch

The door latch secures the dishwasher door closed during operation. Integrated with the latch is a door switch (or multiple switches). This switch sends a signal to the control board. The signal tells the control board that the door is securely closed. If the control board does not receive this signal, it prevents the wash cycle from starting. This means the circulation pump will not activate. No pump activity means no water spray.

Check your door latch for any visible damage. Ensure it closes firmly and latches securely. Sometimes, alignment issues prevent the door from engaging the switch properly. Gently push on the door during a cycle start to see if it makes a difference. You can test the door switch for continuity with a multimeter. If the switch shows no continuity when the door is closed, it is faulty. It needs replacement. If your [Whirlpool dishwasher won't start but has power](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-start-but-has-power), a faulty door latch or switch is a common culprit preventing the cycle from initiating, which includes the spraying action.

### Understanding the Flood Switch and Turbidity Sensor

Beyond the door switch, other sensors also impact operation. The flood switch (or overflow switch) detects excess water in the tub. If it activates, it might stop the wash cycle as a safety measure. This prevents overflowing. A faulty flood switch can sometimes give a false reading. This causes the dishwasher to halt the spray action even when water levels are normal. It is usually a float switch at the bottom of the tub. Ensure it moves freely and is not stuck.

Some newer Whirlpool dishwashers have a turbidity sensor. This sensor detects how dirty the water is. It helps determine the length and intensity of the wash cycle. If this sensor is faulty, it might give incorrect readings. This could confuse the control board. The board might then decide not to spray water, or to spray with less intensity. Cleaning this sensor, typically located in the sump area, can sometimes fix minor issues. If cleaning does not work, the sensor might need replacement.

## Control Board and Electrical Issues

When all other troubleshooting steps fail, the problem might lie within the dishwasher's main control board or its electrical connections. The control board is the "brain" of your Whirlpool dishwasher. It sends signals to every component. This includes the water inlet valve, the circulation pump, and the diverter valve. If the control board malfunctions, it might not send the correct signals. This causes the dishwasher to not spray water.

### How the Control Board Influences Spraying

The control board is responsible for orchestrating the entire wash cycle. It activates the water inlet valve to fill the tub. Then, it turns on the circulation pump to spray water through the arms. It also manages the diverter valve, if present, to direct water flow. If the board has a defect, it might fail to power the circulation pump. This leads to a lack of water spray. You might notice other irregular behaviors too. For example, buttons not responding or cycles not completing.

### Diagnosing Control Board Problems

Diagnosing a faulty control board is often difficult. It requires specialized knowledge and tools. Before suspecting the control board, ensure all other components connected to it are working properly. Check all wire connections to the pump, valves, and sensors. Loose or corroded wires can mimic a control board issue. Always turn off power to the dishwasher before checking any electrical connections.

If you have ruled out all other possibilities, the control board might be the issue. There are usually no simple repairs for a faulty control board. It typically requires replacement. This part can be expensive. Professional diagnosis is recommended for control board issues. They have the right equipment to test the board's outputs. Replacing a control board is a complex task. It involves careful handling of electronics.

## Addressing Drain Issues Affecting Spraying

While it might seem counterintuitive, drainage problems can indirectly affect your Whirlpool dishwasher's ability to spray water effectively. If the dishwasher does not drain correctly, water can accumulate at the bottom of the tub. This excess water can interfere with the wash pump's operation. The pump needs to draw fresh, clean water and propel it with force. If it's dealing with standing, dirty water, it might not perform optimally.

### How Drainage Links to Spray Performance

Modern dishwashers often have sensors that detect water levels. If the water level is consistently too high due to poor drainage, the dishwasher's control system might prevent the wash pump from running at full power. This is a safety mechanism. It prevents overflows. It also ensures the wash cycle progresses correctly. If the dishwasher ends a cycle with water still in the bottom, it's a clear sign of a drainage problem. This standing water affects the quality of the next wash and can impact the pump's ability to create spray pressure. For more on this, consider reading [Why does my Whirlpool dishwasher have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom).

### Common Drain Obstacles

Several issues can cause poor drainage. The drain hose might be kinked or clogged with food debris. Check the hose for any obvious bends. Disconnect it and inspect it for blockages. Sometimes, the drain pump itself is faulty. This pump is responsible for expelling water from the dishwasher. If the drain pump is not working, water cannot leave the tub.

Also, check your kitchen sink's air gap, if you have one. This small cylinder on your countertop helps prevent dirty dishwasher water from flowing back into your sink. An air gap can get clogged with food particles. This restricts drainage. Clean it out regularly. A clogged garbage disposal can also back up into the dishwasher's drain. Ensure your disposal is clear and running properly. Resolving drainage issues helps ensure the wash pump operates under optimal conditions. This allows it to spray water with the correct force and volume.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What does it mean if my Whirlpool dishwasher fills with water but does not spray?

This often points to a problem with the circulation pump, also known as the wash pump. The pump is responsible for forcing water through the spray arms. It could also be a clogged spray arm or a faulty diverter valve. Check the pump for obstructions or electrical issues, and inspect the spray arms for blockages.

### How do I unclog a Whirlpool dishwasher spray arm?

First, remove the spray arm by unscrewing or unlatching it. Use a small, pointed object like a toothpick or a straightened paperclip to clear any food particles from the small holes. Then, rinse the spray arm under a faucet to flush out debris. You can also soak it in white vinegar to remove mineral deposits.

### Can low water pressure affect my dishwasher's spray?

Yes, absolutely. If your home's water pressure is too low, the water inlet valve may not get enough pressure to properly fill the dishwasher, or the circulation pump cannot generate sufficient force to spray water effectively. Check other faucets in your home to confirm general low water pressure.

### How do I know if my Whirlpool dishwasher's circulation pump is bad?

A bad circulation pump typically results in the dishwasher filling with water but producing no spray, or very weak spray. You might not hear the usual strong humming sound during the wash cycle. Sometimes, you can hear grinding noises if the impeller is damaged or jammed. Testing with a multimeter for continuity is the most accurate way to confirm.

### Is it expensive to fix a dishwasher that won't spray water?

The cost varies widely depending on the cause. Simple clogs are free to fix yourself. A new water inlet valve might cost $50-$100. A circulation pump can range from $150-$300 for the part alone. Labor costs for professional repair add to the total. DIY repairs save money but require some mechanical aptitude.
