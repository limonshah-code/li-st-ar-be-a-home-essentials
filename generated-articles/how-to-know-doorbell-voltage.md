Sometimes, a transformer might list multiple output voltages, such as "8V/16V/24V." This means it can provide different voltage levels. The specific voltage in use depends on how it was wired during installation.

Some labels may also include the VA rating. VA stands for Volt-Amperes. This indicates the power capacity of the transformer. For example, "10VA" or "20VA." A higher VA rating means the transformer can supply more power. This is important if you are installing a smart doorbell that needs more power.

Always verify the output voltage you see. This is the voltage that travels to your chime and doorbell button. Knowing this number is essential for compatibility with new doorbell devices. It helps ensure you select the correct replacement or upgrade. This simple step often saves time and effort compared to other methods.

## Using a Multimeter to Measure Voltage

If the transformer label is missing or unreadable, a multimeter is your best friend. A multimeter is an electronic measuring tool. It can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Using a multimeter gives you a precise reading of your doorbell's actual operating voltage. This method ensures accuracy.

Before you start, turn off the power to your doorbell circuit at the breaker box. Safety comes first when working with electricity. Locate the breaker that controls your doorbell. Flip it to the "off" position. Double-check that power is off by pressing the doorbell button. The chime should not sound.

Next, set your multimeter to measure AC voltage. Look for the "V~" or "VAC" setting on your multimeter dial. Select a range that is slightly higher than expected doorbell voltage. For example, if you expect 16V, set the range to 50V or 200V. This prevents damage to your meter.

Now, locate the two low-voltage wires coming from the transformer. These wires connect to the doorbell chime or directly from the transformer. Touch one probe of the multimeter to each of these wires or terminals. Make sure the metal tips of the probes make good contact. The multimeter screen will display the voltage reading. This reading shows you how much power is going to your doorbell. For a detailed guide on this process, you can read more on [how to test doorbell voltage](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-doorbell-voltage).

Repeat the measurement a few times to ensure a consistent reading. Once you have your voltage reading, you can turn the power back on.
