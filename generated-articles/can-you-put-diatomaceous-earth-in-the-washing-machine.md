## Diatomaceous Earth in Washing Machine: A Laundry Myth?

Many people look for natural solutions for their homes. I often consider alternatives to chemical products. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a popular natural product. It is known for many uses, especially pest control. This often leads to questions about its other applications. Can you put diatomaceous earth in the washing machine? It is a common query.

I understand why this question comes up. People hope DE can solve laundry problems like odors or microscopic pests. This article explores whether using diatomaceous earth in your washing machine is a good idea. We will discuss its properties, potential benefits, and the significant risks involved. You will learn about safe alternatives and proper machine care. I want to help you make informed decisions for your home and appliances.

### Takeaway:

*   **Avoid Direct Use:** Do not put diatomaceous earth directly into your washing machine.
*   **Appliance Damage Risk:** DE can clog filters, pipes, and pumps, leading to costly washing machine repairs.
*   **Health Concerns:** Airborne DE can cause respiratory irritation if inhaled.
*   **Ineffective for Laundry:** DE does not effectively clean or treat fabrics in a wash cycle.
*   **Safer Alternatives Exist:** Use baking soda, vinegar, or borax for laundry issues.
*   **Proper Disposal:** If spilled, clean DE with a damp cloth or a shop vac, not a regular vacuum.

### Can You Put Diatomaceous Earth In The Washing Machine?

No, you should not put diatomaceous earth in the washing machine. Diatomaceous earth is an abrasive, fine powder. It presents serious risks to your appliance. It can clog drainage systems and damage internal components. Using it in laundry also offers no real benefit for cleaning clothes or removing pests.

### What is Diatomaceous Earth? Understanding its Properties

Diatomaceous earth is a natural product. It comes from the fossilized remains of diatoms. Diatoms are tiny, aquatic organisms. Their skeletons contain silica. This silica makes DE very hard and abrasive.

There are two main types of DE. Food-grade DE is safe for human and animal consumption. It is commonly used as a dietary supplement or pest control in homes. Filter-grade DE is for industrial filters. It is heat-treated and not safe for ingestion. For household uses, people typically refer to food-grade DE. Even food-grade DE is a fine powder. Its particles have sharp edges. These sharp edges are what make it effective against insects. They scratch the insect's protective coating. This causes the insect to dry out and die.

This abrasive quality is a key point. It explains why DE works as an insecticide. However, it also highlights its potential for damage to other things. It absorbs moisture very well. This property helps it dry out pests. But this absorption also makes it clump when wet. Understanding these basic properties is essential. It helps us see why DE is not suitable for a washing machine.

### Why People Consider Diatomaceous Earth for Laundry

Many individuals seek natural solutions for their laundry. They want to avoid harsh chemicals. Diatomaceous earth sounds like a good natural option. I have seen many people explore its potential. They consider it for several reasons.

One reason is pest control. DE works well against insects like fleas, bed bugs, and dust mites. People think if it kills pests on surfaces, it can kill them on clothes. They imagine it might eliminate dust mites from bedding. Some even hope it could treat clothes for lice or fleas. They look for an all-natural pest solution for their fabrics.

Another perceived benefit is odor removal. Diatomaceous earth absorbs moisture. People assume it can also absorb odors from fabrics. They might have clothes with persistent smells. They consider DE as a powerful deodorizer. They believe it might work better than baking soda. This thought process leads them to consider adding it to the wash.

Some might also see DE as a natural cleaning booster. They think its abrasive quality could help scrub dirt from clothes. They might believe it acts like a gentle scouring powder for fabrics. These ideas are based on DE's known properties for other uses. However, a washing machine environment is very different from a dry surface. These perceived benefits do not translate safely or effectively to laundry use.

### The Risks of Putting Diatomaceous Earth in Your Washing Machine

Putting diatomaceous earth in your washing machine carries significant risks. I want to be clear about these dangers. The machine itself is at high risk of damage. This damage can be costly to repair.

The fine, abrasive nature of DE is the main problem. When you put DE in water, it does not dissolve. It turns into a muddy, gritty paste. This paste easily clogs vital parts of your appliance. The washing machine's drain pump is especially vulnerable. This pump moves water out of the machine. If DE paste enters it, the pump can seize or burn out. Clearing this kind of clog is difficult. The filter is also a common victim. DE will accumulate in the filter, blocking water flow. A clogged filter affects machine performance. You might need to know [how to clean your washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter) often. This is a hassle.

Beyond clogs, DE's abrasive quality harms internal components. It can scratch or wear down plastic and rubber seals. These seals keep water inside the machine. Damaged seals lead to leaks. The water level sensor can also become coated with DE. This causes the machine to fill incorrectly or not at all. Over time, these small damages reduce the lifespan of your appliance. A single mistake could lead to expensive repairs or a new machine purchase. I strongly advise against taking this risk with your washing machine.

### Potential Health Hazards of Diatomaceous Earth in Laundry

Using diatomaceous earth in laundry also poses health risks. These risks primarily involve inhalation. DE is a fine powder. When disturbed, it easily becomes airborne. This is a concern in any closed space, like a laundry room.

Inhaling diatomaceous earth can irritate your respiratory system. The tiny, sharp particles can get into your lungs. This can cause coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing. People with asthma or other respiratory conditions are especially vulnerable. Even for healthy individuals, repeated exposure can be problematic. I always recommend wearing a mask when handling large amounts of DE in dry form. Imagine this powder mixed with water in a washing machine. When the machine agitates, or when you transfer wet laundry, DE particles can still become airborne. The process of drying clothes later could also release dry DE dust.

The dust can also irritate eyes and skin. It can cause dryness or redness. While food-grade DE is less harmful than filter-grade, it is still an irritant. Your laundry room might not have good ventilation. This makes the inhalation risk even higher. The goal of laundry is to clean clothes safely. Introducing a potential respiratory irritant defeats this purpose. For your health and the health of your family, it is best to keep DE out of the wash.

### Effective & Safe Alternatives for Laundry Pest Control and Odor

There are many safe and effective ways to handle laundry pest control and odors. I always look for solutions that protect both my clothes and my appliances. You do not need diatomaceous earth in your washing machine for good results.

For **odor removal**, several common household items work wonders:

*   **Baking Soda:** This is a fantastic natural deodorizer. Add half a cup to your wash cycle with your detergent. It helps neutralize smells. You can also pre-soak smelly clothes in a baking soda and water solution.
*   **White Vinegar:** Vinegar is excellent for cutting through odors and mildews. Add half a cup to the rinse cycle. Do not mix it directly with bleach. Vinegar also acts as a natural fabric softener.
*   **Borax:** This mineral compound is a powerful laundry booster. It helps remove stains and odors. Add half a cup along with your detergent. It can also enhance the effectiveness of your detergent.

For **pest control** on fabrics, consider these methods:

*   **Hot Water Wash:** Many insects and their eggs, like those from bed bugs or lice, cannot survive high temperatures. Washing clothes in the hottest water safe for the fabric often kills them.
*   **High Heat Drying:** The dryer's high heat is very effective. Run clothes on a high heat cycle for at least 30 minutes to kill pests.
*   **Freezing:** For delicate items that cannot be washed hot, place them in a sealed bag and freeze for several days. This kills most pests.
*   **Specific Laundry Additives:** For severe infestations, some laundry products are designed to kill pests safely. Follow product instructions carefully.

When dealing with pests, remember to clean your entire home. [You can use diatomaceous earth on carpets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-demaceous-earth-on-carpets) safely for specific pest problems outside the washer. These alternatives are safer for you and your washing machine. They also effectively address common laundry issues. If you want to know [what to put in a washing machine to clean it](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-to-put-in-a-washing-machine-to-clean-it), baking soda and vinegar are often recommended.

### Proper Diatomaceous Earth Use Around the Home (Not in Laundry)

Diatomaceous earth is a valuable tool for many home needs. It just is not meant for the washing machine. I use DE for specific purposes. When used correctly, it is a safe and effective natural solution.

**Effective uses for Diatomaceous Earth:**

*   **Pest Control (Dry Areas):** This is where DE shines. Sprinkle food-grade DE in dry areas where pests live or travel. This includes cracks, crevices, under appliances, or along baseboards. It works well for ants, cockroaches, fleas, and silverfish. Remember, DE needs to stay dry to be effective against insects.
*   **Garden Pest Control:** Apply DE around garden plants to deter slugs, snails, and other crawling insects. Reapply after rain.
*   **Pet Flea Control:** Lightly dust food-grade DE onto pet bedding or directly onto their fur (consult a vet first). It helps kill fleas by drying them out.
*   **Odor Absorption (Dry):** Place small dishes of DE in areas needing deodorizing. This includes garbage cans or pet litter boxes. It absorbs moisture and odors effectively.
*   **Food Storage:** Add a small amount of food-grade DE to grains, legumes, or pet food. This prevents insect infestations. It is safe for consumption in these small amounts.

**Important Handling Tips:**

*   **Wear a Mask:** Always wear a dust mask when applying DE, especially in large quantities. This prevents inhalation of fine particles.
*   **Eye Protection:** Goggles are also a good idea to prevent eye irritation.
*   **Apply Sparingly:** A light dusting is all you need. Pests need to walk through it, not be buried in it.
*   **Clean-up:** If you need to clean up DE, use a damp cloth or a shop vacuum. Regular household vacuums can get clogged or have their filters damaged by the fine powder.

Using DE correctly ensures safety for your family and effectiveness for the problem. It protects your appliances from unnecessary damage.

### Maintaining Your Washing Machine: Preventing Issues

Proper washing machine maintenance is crucial. It keeps your appliance running well. It also prevents the types of issues that diatomaceous earth would cause. I make sure to care for my washing machine regularly.

**Key maintenance tips:**

*   **Clean the Dispenser:** Detergent and fabric softener can leave residue. Clean your dispenser regularly. This prevents clogs and ensures products dispense correctly.
*   **Wipe Down the Drum and Gasket:** Mold and mildew can grow in damp areas. Wipe the drum and door gasket after each use. Leave the door ajar to allow air circulation.
*   **Clean the Filter:** Your washing machine has a filter. It catches lint, coins, and other small items. I check and clean this filter every few months. This prevents clogs and ensures proper drainage. Knowing [how do you clean the washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-you-clean-the-washing-machine-filter) is important for preventing drainage issues.
*   **Run a Cleaning Cycle:** Use a washing machine cleaner or run a hot cycle with white vinegar or baking soda. This removes detergent buildup and kills odors. This should be done monthly.
*   **Check Hoses:** Inspect water intake and drain hoses periodically. Look for cracks, bulges, or leaks. Replace them if you see any damage.
*   **Load Properly:** Do not overload your washing machine. This stresses the motor and can prevent clothes from getting clean. Understand [how full a washing machine should be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-washing-machine-should-be) for optimal performance.
*   **Use Proper Detergent:** Always use high-efficiency (HE) detergent if your machine requires it. Using too much or the wrong type of detergent creates excessive suds. This can harm your machine.

Regular maintenance extends the life of your appliance. It also helps you avoid costly repairs. A clean and well-maintained washing machine works efficiently. It washes your clothes effectively, without the need for risky additives like diatomaceous earth.
