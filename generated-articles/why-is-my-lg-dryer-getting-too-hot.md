## Why Your LG Dryer Is Getting Too Hot

You load your LG dryer with fresh laundry. You expect warm, fluffy clothes. Instead, you find items scorched or even damaged. An LG dryer getting too hot is a serious problem. It poses a fire risk and can ruin your clothes. This issue often stems from common causes like blocked vents or faulty components.

Understanding why your LG dryer overheats helps you address the problem safely. We will explore the main reasons this happens. We will also provide clear steps to diagnose and fix these issues. This guide helps you restore your dryer's safe operation. Let's make your laundry routine efficient and worry-free again.

### Takeaway

If your LG dryer gets too hot, here are the key steps to take:

*   **Clean the Dryer Vent:** Remove lint buildup from the entire vent system.
*   **Check the Lint Trap:** Ensure the lint filter is clean before every load.
*   **Inspect Thermostats:** Test and replace cycling and high-limit thermostats if faulty.
*   **Examine the Heating Element:** Look for signs of damage or shorting in the element.
*   **Verify the Blower Wheel:** Make sure the blower wheel is intact and spinning correctly.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Do not pack too many clothes into the dryer.

Your LG dryer gets too hot primarily due to restricted airflow or failing thermal components. A clogged dryer vent is the most common cause, trapping heat inside. Faulty thermostats or a malfunctioning heating element can also lead to excessive temperatures. Address these issues promptly to ensure safety and prevent damage.

## Blocked Dryer Vent: A Major Cause of LG Dryer Overheating

A blocked dryer vent is often the main reason an LG dryer gets too hot. Lint, debris, and even small articles of clothing can accumulate in the vent hose. This blockage restricts airflow. When air cannot flow freely, heat builds up inside the dryer drum. This causes your dryer to run hotter than intended. It also creates a fire hazard.

LG dryers rely on proper airflow to exhaust hot, moist air. When the vent is blocked, the dryer cannot release this heat. The internal temperature continues to rise. This can lead to clothes feeling extremely hot or even burning. Checking and cleaning your dryer vent is a critical maintenance task.

### How a Clogged Vent Causes Overheating

Your dryer uses a heating element to warm the air. A blower fan pushes this hot air through the drum. The air then exits through the lint trap and out the vent. If the vent line is clogged, the hot air has nowhere to go. It recirculates within the dryer. This makes the dryer overheat quickly.

The dryer's safety thermostats may trip repeatedly. This causes the dryer to shut off mid-cycle or take longer to dry clothes. Over time, constant overheating puts strain on other components. This includes the heating element and motor. Lint buildup is also highly flammable. A blocked vent increases the risk of a dryer fire. Regular cleaning prevents these dangerous scenarios.

### Steps to Clean Your Dryer Vent

Cleaning your dryer vent is a task you can do yourself. First, unplug the dryer for safety. Disconnect the vent hose from the back of the dryer. Also, disconnect it from the wall connection. Use a vacuum cleaner with a long hose attachment to remove lint from both ends. You should also clean the inside of the dryer's vent port.

Consider using a dryer vent cleaning brush kit. These kits have long, flexible rods that can extend through the entire vent line. Push the brush through the ductwork to dislodge all lint. Clean the entire length of the vent, from the dryer to the exterior exhaust hood. Ensure the outdoor vent flap opens and closes freely. A thoroughly cleaned vent ensures proper airflow.

## Faulty Thermostat: Misreading Temperatures in Your LG Dryer

Thermostats are crucial safety devices in your LG dryer. They monitor and regulate the internal temperature. There are typically two types of thermostats. The cycling thermostat controls the operating temperature during a cycle. The high-limit thermostat acts as a safety switch. It cuts power to the heating element if temperatures get too high. If either of these thermostats fails, your LG dryer can start getting too hot.

A faulty cycling thermostat might not accurately sense the temperature. It may fail to turn off the heating element when the correct temperature is reached. This results in continuous heat, leading to overheating. A defective high-limit thermostat may fail to trip. This means it won't shut off power even when the dryer is dangerously hot. In both cases, the dryer poses a risk.

### Locating and Testing Thermostats

LG dryers usually have thermostats located near the heating element or the blower housing. Always unplug your dryer before starting any inspection or repair. You may need to remove the back panel of your dryer to access these components. Once located, you can visually inspect them for any signs of burning or damage.

To test a thermostat, use a multimeter set to the Rx1 setting. Place the multimeter probes on the terminals of the thermostat. A working thermostat should show continuity. If the multimeter does not show continuity, the thermostat is faulty and needs replacement. A broken thermostat cannot regulate heat.

### Replacing a Defective Thermostat

Replacing a faulty thermostat is a straightforward process for many DIYers. Once you confirm a thermostat is bad, order a replacement part specific to your LG dryer model. Carefully disconnect the wires attached to the old thermostat. Note their positions or take a picture. Remove the mounting screws that hold the thermostat in place.

Install the new thermostat in the exact same position. Secure it with the screws. Reattach the wires correctly to the new thermostat's terminals. Make sure all connections are snug. Once replaced, reassemble the dryer panels. Then, plug in and test the dryer. If your LG dryer is still running but [not getting hot](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dryer-running-but-not-heating) enough, a thermostat could also be the cause, just the opposite scenario.

## Worn Heating Element: When Your LG Dryer Heats Too Much

The heating element is the part of your LG dryer that creates heat. It is a coil of wire that glows red when electricity passes through it. Normally, this element cycles on and off to maintain the desired temperature. However, a worn or damaged heating element can sometimes cause your LG dryer to get too hot. This happens if the coil shorts out or if a part of it makes contact with the dryer's frame.

When the heating element shorts, it can cause it to remain energized continuously. This means it produces heat without interruption. The dryer's controls or thermostats may not be able to cycle it off effectively. This constant heat output leads to severe overheating. This problem can be dangerous. It requires immediate attention to prevent fire.

### Identifying Heating Element Failure

Signs of a faulty heating element causing overheating include:
*   **Scorched clothes:** Clothes come out with burn marks or smell burnt.
*   **Excessive heat:** The dryer feels extremely hot to the touch.
*   **Continuous heating:** The dryer never seems to cycle off the heat, even on cool settings.

To inspect the heating element, unplug the dryer first. You will need to access the heating element housing. This is typically located at the back or bottom of the dryer. Carefully remove the housing cover. Look for any breaks in the heating coil. Check for signs of the coil touching the metal frame. A visual inspection often reveals the problem. You can also use a multimeter to check for continuity and shorts. This confirms the element's integrity.

### Professional vs. DIY Heating Element Replacement

Replacing a heating element can be a DIY task for those comfortable with appliance repair. You need to ensure you get the exact replacement part for your LG dryer model. The process involves disconnecting wires and removing mounting screws. Then, you swap out the old element for the new one. Ensure all connections are secure.

However, if you are unsure or uncomfortable with electrical components, hiring a professional is a safer choice. An appliance repair technician can quickly diagnose the issue. They can replace the heating element correctly. This ensures your dryer operates safely. Incorrect installation can worsen the problem or create new hazards.

## Blower Wheel Problems: Impeding Airflow in Your LG Dryer

The blower wheel, also called the squirrel cage fan, is vital for proper airflow in your LG dryer. It pulls in ambient air, moves it over the heating element, and then pushes the hot, moist air out through the exhaust vent. If the blower wheel is damaged or obstructed, it cannot move air effectively. This lack of airflow can cause your LG dryer to get too hot.

A broken blower wheel might have bent or missing fins. It might also be loose on its motor shaft. When the blower wheel is not moving enough air, the heat generated by the heating element gets trapped inside the dryer drum. This leads to an increase in internal temperature. It also makes clothes take much longer to dry, if they dry at all.

### Checking the Blower Wheel

To check the blower wheel, you must first unplug your LG dryer. Accessing the blower wheel often requires removing the back panel or sometimes the front panel of the dryer, depending on the model. Once you gain access, visually inspect the blower wheel. Look for any cracks, broken fins, or debris lodged within the wheel.

Also, try to wiggle the blower wheel. It should be securely attached to the motor shaft. If it spins freely without the motor, or if it wobbles, it might be loose. A loose wheel will not generate enough airflow. Clear any lint or obstructions around the blower wheel. Poor airflow can also make your [LG dryer take too long to dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-take-so-long-to-dry), indicating an airflow problem.

### Repairing or Replacing the Blower Wheel

If the blower wheel is simply loose, you might be able to tighten the retaining nut or screw that holds it to the motor shaft. If the wheel itself is cracked, broken, or has missing fins, it needs replacement. You cannot effectively repair a broken plastic blower wheel. Order a replacement part specific to your LG dryer model.

Installation involves removing the old wheel and sliding the new one onto the motor shaft. Secure it properly with the retaining nut or clamp. Ensure the new wheel fits snugly and spins freely without hitting any housing components. Once the new blower wheel is in place, reassemble the dryer. Then, test it to confirm proper operation and airflow.

## Restricted Lint Trap: A Simple Fix for an Overheating LG Dryer

The lint trap, or lint filter, is your dryer's first line of defense against lint buildup. It catches most of the lint shed by clothes during drying. While cleaning it after every load seems simple, neglecting this step is a common mistake. A heavily clogged lint trap significantly restricts airflow within the dryer drum. This can cause your LG dryer to get too hot.

When airflow is reduced, the hot air produced by the heating element gets trapped inside. It cannot circulate effectively or be exhausted outside. This leads to heat accumulation and inefficient drying. Beyond overheating, a lint-filled trap is also a fire hazard. The trapped lint is highly flammable.

### Daily Lint Trap Cleaning

It is important to clean your LG dryer's lint trap before or after every single load of laundry. This habit takes only a few seconds. Pull the lint screen out of its slot. Use your fingers to peel off the accumulated layer of lint. Dispose of the lint properly. This simple step maintains optimal airflow. It prevents heat buildup and keeps your dryer running efficiently.

Making this a routine can prevent many common dryer issues. Many LG dryers will display a "Clean Filter" message if the lint trap is too full. Ignoring this warning can lead to overheating. If your [LG dryer keeps saying clean filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dryer-keep-saying-clean-filter), it's a clear sign of restricted airflow.

### Deep Cleaning the Lint Screen

Over time, dryer sheets and fabric softener residue can build up on the lint screen. This residue creates a fine, invisible film. This film can still restrict airflow even if the visible lint is removed. You can test for this film by holding the screen under running water. If water beads up on the screen instead of flowing through, it has residue buildup.

To deep clean the lint screen, gently scrub it with a soft brush and warm, soapy water. Use a mild detergent. Rinse the screen thoroughly under running water until water passes through easily. Let the screen air dry completely before putting it back into the dryer. This deep cleaning should be done every few months. It ensures maximum airflow and prevents your LG dryer from getting too hot due to a clogged screen.

## Sensor Malfunctions: Inaccurate Temperature Readings in Your LG Dryer

Modern LG dryers use various sensors to monitor and control the drying process. These include thermistors and moisture sensors. Thermistors measure temperature. Moisture sensors detect the dampness of clothes. If these sensors malfunction, they can send incorrect signals to the dryer's control board. This can cause your LG dryer to get too hot.

For example, a faulty thermistor might inaccurately report a lower temperature than the actual temperature inside the drum. The control board would then instruct the heating element to stay on longer. This results in the dryer producing excessive heat. Similarly, malfunctioning moisture sensors might prematurely end a cycle or cause the dryer to run longer, depending on the error, potentially affecting temperature regulation.

### How Sensors Control Heat

Thermistors play a critical role in temperature regulation. They are resistive temperature devices. Their resistance changes with temperature. The dryer's control board reads this resistance. It then adjusts the heating element's operation to maintain the set temperature. If a thermistor gives a false reading, the heating element may stay on for too long. This leads to overheating.

Moisture sensors, often located on the front bulkhead of the drum, detect the conductivity of the clothes. When clothes are wet, they conduct electricity. As they dry, conductivity decreases. The dryer's control board uses this information to determine when the cycle should end. While not directly controlling heat, inaccurate moisture readings can prolong cycles. This extended runtime can exacerbate an underlying overheating issue.

### Testing and Replacing Dryer Sensors

Testing dryer sensors typically requires a multimeter. Unplug the dryer before any inspection. For thermistors, you would measure their resistance at room temperature. Compare this reading to the dryer's service manual specifications. A significant deviation indicates a faulty sensor. Moisture sensors are usually continuity checked. Look for visual signs of damage or lint accumulation on their strips.

Replacing a faulty sensor involves locating it, disconnecting wires, and unmounting it. Install the new sensor, reconnect wires, and reassemble the dryer. Ensure you get the correct part number for your specific LG model. Sensor issues can be tricky to diagnose without proper tools and knowledge. If you are unsure, consider consulting a professional.

## Overloading Your LG Dryer: User Habits Affecting Heat

Overloading your LG dryer is a common habit that can inadvertently lead to overheating. When you pack too many clothes into the dryer drum, several problems arise. First, there isn't enough space for the clothes to tumble freely. This reduces the amount of air that can circulate among the garments. Second, the sheer volume of clothes can block the airflow path.

Reduced airflow prevents the hot, moist air from being properly exhausted. This causes heat to build up inside the drum. The dryer works harder and longer to dry the dense load. This extended operation at higher temperatures can stress components. It also increases the risk of your LG dryer getting too hot. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended load size.

### Proper Loading Practices

To prevent overheating caused by overloading, always load your LG dryer correctly. Do not fill the drum more than two-thirds full. This leaves enough space for clothes to tumble and for air to circulate freely. Large, bulky items like comforters or blankets should be dried alone or with only one or two smaller items. They take up a lot of space and can trap heat.

Mixing heavy and light fabrics in the same load can also be problematic. Heavy items retain moisture longer. Lighter items dry faster. This leads to the dryer running longer than necessary for the lighter items. This can potentially overheat them. Sort your laundry by fabric type and weight for more efficient drying.

### Impact on Drying Performance

Overloading not only causes your LG dryer to get too hot but also severely impacts its drying performance. Clothes come out damp or wrinkled. They may also feel excessively hot to the touch. The dryer may run for much longer cycles, consuming more energy. This increases your utility bills.

Furthermore, constant overloading puts unnecessary strain on the dryer's motor and belts. This can shorten the appliance's lifespan. Adopting proper loading habits protects your dryer. It also ensures your clothes dry effectively and safely. It also prevents the frustrating problem of an LG dryer getting too hot.
