## Protect Your Investment: How To Winterize A Samsung Washing Machine

As the colder months approach, many people prepare their homes for winter. We cover plants, seal windows, and check the heating system. But do you remember your appliances? Your Samsung washing machine, a valuable part of your home, needs protection too. Learning how to winterize a Samsung washing machine prevents costly damage from freezing temperatures.

I often think about the care my appliances need. This guide will help you keep your Samsung washer safe. We will explore why winterizing is important and what steps to take. We cover draining water, disconnecting hoses, and storing your machine. This article provides clear instructions to protect your washing machine all winter long.

### Takeaway

To winterize your Samsung washing machine effectively, follow these key steps:

*   Shut off water supply lines to the machine.
*   Disconnect both hot and cold water hoses.
*   Drain all remaining water from the hoses and the machine's internal system.
*   Clean the dispenser and drum, ensuring they are dry.
*   Move the washer to a stable, dry, and freeze-proof location if possible.
*   Consider using RV antifreeze for pump protection in extreme cold.

Winterizing a Samsung washing machine involves removing all water from its lines and drum. This prevents freezing. Freezing water expands, which causes pipes and components to burst. Disconnect hoses, drain water, and ensure the machine is dry. This simple process protects your appliance during cold weather.

## Understanding the Need to Winterize Your Samsung Washing Machine

Winter weather brings risks to many home systems. Your Samsung washing machine faces a specific threat: freezing water. When water freezes, it expands. This expansion can cause severe damage inside your appliance. Water lines, pumps, and even the drum itself can crack or burst. Such damage leads to expensive repairs or even needing a new machine.

I have seen many appliances ruined by cold. Preventing this damage is simple with proper winterization. This process is crucial if your washing machine is in an unheated area. A garage, basement, or utility room without heat is a prime example. Even temporary freezing can be destructive. Taking the time to winterize your Samsung washing machine saves you money and stress. It ensures your appliance remains ready for use when spring arrives.

### The Dangers of Freezing Water

Water inside your washing machine can freeze solid. This happens when temperatures drop below freezing. The internal components are not designed for this stress. Pipes made of plastic or metal can rupture. The water inlet valve, drain pump, and dispenser can all sustain harm. Ice acts like a wedge, pushing parts apart.

Repairing freeze damage is often complex. Technicians must replace multiple parts. Sometimes, the damage is too widespread for repair. My friend once had a washing machine in an unheated cabin. She forgot to winterize it. The burst pipes created a flood when she turned the water back on. This caused damage to the floor and walls. A small effort to winterize avoids large problems later.

### Who Needs to Winterize Their Washer?

Not everyone needs to winterize their Samsung washing machine. You should consider winterization if:

*   Your washer sits in an unheated garage or shed.
*   You plan to store the machine in an area exposed to freezing temperatures.
*   You will be away from home for an extended period during winter.
*   Your home's heating system might fail during a power outage.

If your washer is always in a heated space, winterization might not be necessary. However, it is always safer to take precautions if any risk exists. I live in a region with unpredictable winters. I always check if any appliances are near exterior walls or in colder spots. This helps me decide if winterizing is a good idea. Knowing how to winterize a Samsung washing machine gives peace of mind.

## Essential Tools and Supplies for Winterizing Your Washer

Before you start winterizing your Samsung washing machine, gather your supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and quick. You do not want to stop halfway through because you missed an item. I always make a checklist before starting any home project. This helps me stay organized.

The right tools ensure you complete each step correctly and safely. Most items are common household tools. You might already own them. If not, they are easy to find at a local hardware store. Gathering these items beforehand prevents delays. It also ensures you can protect your appliance properly.

### What You Will Need

Here is a list of items you will need:

*   **Bucket or shallow pan:** This collects any remaining water from hoses.
*   **Towels or rags:** For wiping up spills and drying parts.
*   **Pliers or adjustable wrench:** For disconnecting water supply hoses.
*   **Phillips or flathead screwdriver:** To open certain panels, if needed.
*   **RV antifreeze (optional but recommended for extreme cold):** This non-toxic solution protects the pump and internal lines. Make sure it is RV-specific; do not use automotive antifreeze.
*   **Insulation or blankets (for long-term storage):** To cover the machine for added protection.
*   **Dolly or appliance movers (if relocating the washer):** Makes moving heavy appliances safer.

I find that having a headlamp helps too. It illuminates tight spaces behind the washer. This makes it easier to see connections and potential leaks. Always prioritize safety when working with appliances. Ensure you have good lighting and a stable work area.

### Safety First: Preparing Your Workspace

Preparing your workspace is an important step. First, make sure the area around the washer is clear. You need room to work behind the machine. Remove any clutter or obstacles. This prevents trips and falls. Next, ensure good lighting. A bright space helps you see what you are doing.

Wear gloves if you prefer. They protect your hands. Always keep towels handy for spills. Water can surprise you, even when you expect it. Finally, if you use RV antifreeze, read its safety instructions. Keep it away from children and pets. Proper preparation makes the winterization process safer for you and your machine.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Draining Water from Your Samsung Washer

Draining all water from your Samsung washing machine is the most important step in winterization. Any water left inside can freeze and cause damage. This process involves several stages, from turning off the water supply to emptying the drain hose. I always take my time with this part. Rushing can leave water behind.

Follow these instructions carefully to ensure no water remains in your appliance. This protects the internal components effectively. Remember, water expands by about 9% when it freezes. Even a small amount can exert tremendous pressure. Proper draining prevents this destructive expansion.

### 1. Shut Off the Water Supply

First, locate the hot and cold water supply valves. These are usually behind the washing machine. They are often red for hot and blue for cold. Turn both valves clockwise until they are completely closed. This stops water from flowing into the machine.

After closing the valves, run a short wash cycle on your Samsung washer. Select a small load setting or a rinse and spin cycle. This helps release any remaining water pressure in the hoses. It also clears some water from the internal lines. Let the machine run for about 30 seconds. Then, turn it off. This prepares the machine for disconnecting the hoses.

### 2. Disconnect Water Supply Hoses

Place your bucket or shallow pan behind the washer. You will use it to catch water. Then, use pliers or an adjustable wrench to loosen the nuts connecting the hot and cold water hoses to the back of the washer. Turn them counter-clockwise.

Once loose, carefully unscrew the hoses by hand. Some water will likely come out. Allow the hoses to drain completely into the bucket. After they finish draining, inspect the hose screens. Clean any debris from them. Store the hoses in a warm, dry place. You can also connect them to each other to keep them clean.

### 3. Drain the Washer's Internal System

Your Samsung washing machine has a drain pump filter and a drain hose. You need to drain water from both.

#### Draining the Drain Pump Filter:
*   Locate the small access panel on the front bottom of your washer. Open it.
*   You will see a small, flexible drain hose and a larger pump filter cap.
*   Place your shallow pan or towel under the small drain hose.
*   Remove the cap from the small drain hose. Let any water flow into your pan.
*   Once it stops, replace the cap.
*   Next, carefully unscrew the larger pump filter cap. Be ready for more water. Let it drain.
*   Clean the filter screen of any lint or debris. This is a good time for maintenance.
*   Screw the filter cap back on tightly. Close the access panel.

#### Draining the Drain Hose:
*   Remove the washer's drain hose from its standpipe or sink connection.
*   Hold the end of the hose lower than the washing machine. This allows gravity to drain any residual water.
*   Let all water empty into your bucket.
*   Once empty, secure the drain hose. You can tape it to the back of the washer. This keeps it from touching the floor.

Make sure to wipe up any water spills immediately. This prevents slipping and mold growth. Ensuring all water is out is critical for winter protection.

## Disconnecting and Securing Hoses and Power

After draining the water, the next step is to properly disconnect and secure all hoses. You also need to manage the power supply. These actions prevent accidental water flow and electrical issues. They also prepare the machine for safe storage or dormancy. I always double-check these connections. Loose ends can become problems later.

Properly securing hoses prevents them from getting damaged or lost. Managing the power cord ensures safety. It also protects the machine's electronics from power surges during inactive periods. This attention to detail is part of comprehensive winterization. It gives you peace of mind that your Samsung washing machine is truly ready for winter.

### Disconnecting the Hot and Cold Water Hoses

You have already loosened and unscrewed the hot and cold water supply hoses from the back of the washer. Now, fully detach them. Let any last drips fall into your bucket. Once fully detached, inspect the washers inside the hose connectors. If they are worn or cracked, replace them before reconnecting the hoses in spring.

It's a good idea to coil the hoses neatly. You can tie them with a twist tie or zip tie. Store them in a dry place. Some people like to connect the two ends of the hoses together. This keeps dust and insects out. Ensure they are kept away from foot traffic to avoid crimping or damage.

### Securing the Drain Hose

The drain hose usually hooks into a standpipe or over the edge of a utility sink. Remove it from its position. If you have not already, lower the hose to drain any remaining water. After it is empty, secure it to the back of the washing machine. You can use strong tape or a bungee cord.

Keep the drain hose elevated slightly. This prevents gravity from drawing water into the hose if any moisture is present in the drain system. Taping it prevents it from swinging around during moving. It also keeps it off the floor. This protects the hose from getting stepped on or damaged.

### Managing the Power Supply

First, unplug the Samsung washing machine from the electrical outlet. This is a crucial safety step. It eliminates any risk of electrical shock. It also protects the machine's control board from power fluctuations during its inactive period.

Coil the power cord neatly. You can secure it with a cable tie or twist tie. Tape it to the back of the machine. This keeps the cord organized and out of the way. It prevents tripping hazards. It also ensures the cord does not get damaged during storage or moving. Properly handling the power supply is essential for overall safety and machine longevity.

## Protecting Internal Components and the Drum

Once the water is drained and hoses are disconnected, focus on the internal parts. The pump and drum need attention. Even after draining, some moisture can remain in crevices. This can lead to mold or mildew. Protecting these areas ensures your Samsung washing machine stays clean and fresh. It also helps prevent corrosion or damage to sensitive parts.

I like to think of this step as tucking the machine in for its long winter nap. It needs a little extra care. This section covers cleaning the drum and dispenser. It also discusses using RV antifreeze for extra protection in very cold environments. This comprehensive approach ensures all vulnerable parts are safe.

### Cleaning the Drum and Dispenser

Before storage, clean the washing machine drum. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum. Remove any residue or lint. For a deeper clean, you can run a "Self Clean" cycle if your machine has one. This helps clear out any build-up. After cleaning, leave the washer door slightly ajar. This allows air to circulate inside. Air circulation prevents musty odors and mildew growth.

Next, clean the detergent dispenser drawer. Pull it out and rinse it with warm water. Remove any soap residue or fabric softener buildup. Use a small brush for hard-to-reach areas. Let the dispenser drawer dry completely. You can leave it slightly open or removed during storage. This helps prevent mold and keeps the dispenser clean.

### Using RV Antifreeze for Pump Protection

For environments with extreme cold, RV antifreeze offers extra protection. RV antifreeze is non-toxic and safe for plumbing systems. Do not use automotive antifreeze; it is toxic. This step protects the drain pump and any small, hard-to-drain water lines.

To use RV antifreeze:
1.  Pour about one quart (or liter) of RV antifreeze into the detergent dispenser.
2.  Close the dispenser drawer.
3.  Plug the washing machine back into the outlet temporarily.
4.  Select a drain and spin cycle. Allow the machine to run for about 15-20 seconds. This circulates the antifreeze through the pump.
5.  Unplug the machine again immediately.
6.  The antifreeze now sits in the pump and lower lines. It prevents any residual water from freezing.

I always consider this step if I know temperatures will drop well below zero. It adds a layer of assurance. This is especially true if the machine is in an area that gets very cold, like an unheated shed. This simple action can save the pump from freezing and breaking.

## Preparing Your Samsung Washer for Storage

After draining and protecting the internal components, the next step is to prepare your Samsung washer for storage. This includes choosing the right location and covering the machine. Proper storage protects the exterior and interior from dust, pests, and potential physical damage. It ensures your machine remains in good condition until you need it again.

Ensuring your machine is correctly prepared is key to its longevity.

### Choosing the Right Storage Location

The best place to store your Samsung washing machine is a dry, temperature-controlled environment. This means a heated basement or a climate-controlled storage unit. If these are not options, a garage or shed can work. But you must ensure it is as protected from extreme cold as possible. Do not store it directly on cold concrete if you can avoid it.

Consider placing a pallet or sturdy piece of wood under the washer. This lifts it off the ground. Lifting helps protect it from moisture or temperature swings coming from the floor. Ensure the location is free from pests. Rodents can chew through wires. Check for any leaks in the ceiling or walls. A dry environment is critical for preventing rust and electrical damage.

### Securing and Leveling the Machine

If you are moving your Samsung washer, use an appliance dolly. Secure the washer to the dolly with straps. This prevents it from tipping. When placing it in its storage spot, make sure it is level. Use a level tool to check the top of the machine. Adjust the leveling feet if necessary.

Leveling prevents stress on the internal components. It also keeps the machine stable. A stable washer is less likely to get damaged if accidentally bumped. If the machine will sit unused for a long time, consider engaging the drum lock or shipping bolts. Some Samsung models come with these for transport. They keep the drum from moving during transit or extended storage. This is particularly important for front-load washers.

Maintaining optimal performance of your washing machine also involves regular checks, even during storage. If you ever notice issues with cycles or performance once you bring it back online, you might need to [calibrate your Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-calibrate-a-samsung-washing-machine) to reset its internal sensors.

### Covering Your Washer for Protection

Once the washer is in its storage location and level, cover it. Use a breathable appliance cover, an old blanket, or even a large sheet. This protects the machine from dust, dirt, and scratches. It also deters pests from nesting inside. Do not use plastic tarps directly against the machine. Plastic can trap moisture and lead to condensation or mold.

Make sure the cover allows some air circulation. Leave the washer door slightly ajar, even when covered. This continues to prevent musty odors. A good cover provides a barrier. It keeps the machine clean and ready for use when spring arrives. This simple step protects the exterior finish and ensures the machine looks good.

## Reactivating Your Samsung Washing Machine After Winter

### 1. Reconnecting Water Supply Hoses

First, ensure the hot and cold water supply valves are still closed. This prevents any sudden gush of water. Retrieve your hot and cold water hoses. Inspect them for any damage or wear during storage. Replace any worn washers inside the connectors if you haven't already.

Attach the hot water hose to the hot water inlet (usually marked with red). Attach the cold water hose to the cold water inlet (usually marked with blue). Hand-tighten the connections first. Then, use pliers or an adjustable wrench to tighten them another quarter turn. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the connections.

### 2. Reconnecting the Drain Hose and Power

Next, reinsert the drain hose into its standpipe or hook it over the edge of your utility sink. Ensure it is secure and cannot easily come loose. The end of the drain hose should be above the water level in the standpipe to prevent siphoning.

Once the hoses are connected, plug the Samsung washing machine back into a grounded electrical outlet. Make sure the cord is not pinched or damaged. The machine should power on. If it does not, check the circuit breaker.

### 3. Checking for Leaks and Initial Cycles

With hoses connected and power on, slowly open the hot and cold water supply valves. Turn them counter-clockwise. Watch the connections behind the washer carefully. Look for any drips or leaks. If you see a leak, tighten the connection a little more. If it persists, you may need to replace the rubber washer.

Once you confirm no leaks, run a short, empty wash cycle. Use warm water if possible. This flushes out any remaining RV antifreeze (if used) or stagnant water. It also primes the water lines. Do not add clothes during this cycle. Some people add a cup of white vinegar to the drum during this flush cycle. Vinegar helps clean the drum and remove any odors.

After the flush cycle, your Samsung washing machine is ready for normal use. If you notice any unusual noises or performance issues, you might need to [calibrate your Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-calibrate-a-samsung-washing-machine).
