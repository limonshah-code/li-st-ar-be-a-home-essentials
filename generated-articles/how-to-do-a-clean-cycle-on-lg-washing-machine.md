### Why Your LG Washing Machine Needs Regular Clean Cycles

Your LG washing machine works hard, washing away dirt and grime from your clothes. However, this hard work also means residues can accumulate inside the drum and other hidden parts. You might notice unpleasant odors or even see visible mold and mildew. This build-up affects your machine's performance. It can also leave your laundry less clean and fresh.

Regular clean cycles address these issues directly. They flush out detergent residue, fabric softener, and bio-film that builds up over time. A clean machine washes clothes more effectively. It also uses less energy because its components are not hindered by grime. This routine care extends the life of your appliance. It ensures every wash comes out perfectly clean and fresh. [Why clean washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-clean-washing-machine) articles explain this in more detail.

Moreover, ignoring regular cleaning can lead to bigger problems. Mold and mildew thrive in warm, damp environments. These conditions are often found inside a washing machine drum. These growths can cause strong, persistent odors that transfer to your clothes. They also pose potential health concerns. Running a clean cycle prevents these issues from taking root. It maintains a hygienic washing environment. [How often to run clean cycle on washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-to-run-clean-cycle-on-washing-machine) depends on usage, but monthly is a good starting point.

### Preparing Your LG Washer for a Thorough Clean Cycle

Before you initiate any cleaning cycle on your LG washing machine, some preparation steps are essential. These steps ensure the cleaning process is effective. They also protect your machine and your future laundry loads. First, always make sure the washing machine drum is completely empty. There should be no clothes, towels, or any other items inside. Running a clean cycle with laundry present could damage your clothes or interfere with the cleaning agent.

Next, I always check and clean the detergent dispenser drawers. These drawers are notorious for accumulating sticky detergent and fabric softener residues. You can usually remove the drawers by pressing a release tab or pulling firmly. Wash them under warm running water. Use a small brush or old toothbrush to scrub away any hardened buildup. If mold or mildew is present, a solution of warm water and vinegar can help.

Lastly, I also inspect the rubber door gasket, especially on front-load LG washing machines. The door gasket is a prime spot for mold and mildew growth. Wipe it thoroughly with a damp cloth. You can use a mild soap or a vinegar solution for stubborn grime. Make sure to pull back the folds of the gasket to clean hidden areas. Removing visible debris now helps the clean cycle work better later. This preparation sets the stage for a truly deep clean.

### Step-by-Step: Running the Tub Clean Cycle on Your LG Washing Machine

Running a "Tub Clean" cycle on your LG washing machine is straightforward. This process varies slightly between models, but the core steps remain consistent. Most LG models feature a dedicated "Tub Clean" or "Cleaner" cycle. It is specifically designed to flush out internal residues. Start by ensuring the washer is empty. Check for any forgotten items inside the drum.

Next, add your chosen cleaning agent. For front-load machines, you will typically pour the cleaner directly into the main detergent dispenser. Some LG models have a specific "Tub Clean" compartment within the dispenser. For top-load machines, you often add the cleaning agent directly into the drum. Always refer to your LG washing machine's user manual for precise instructions. This confirms the correct placement for your specific model.

Now, select the "Tub Clean" cycle from your control panel. If your LG washer does not have a "Tub Clean" cycle, choose the "Hot" or "Sanitize" cycle. Set the water temperature to the hottest available setting. Then, press the "Start" button. The machine will fill, agitate, soak, and drain multiple times. This process removes buildup effectively. The cycle usually takes over an hour. Do not interrupt the cycle once it begins.

For LG HE (High Efficiency) washing machines, the process is largely the same. These machines use less water, so they are prone to different types of residue buildup. The "Tub Clean" cycle on an LG HE washer uses specific water levels and agitation patterns. This optimizes cleaning for HE detergents. Follow the same steps, adding an HE-compatible cleaner or a small amount of bleach.

### Choosing the Right Cleaning Agent for Your LG Washer

Selecting the right cleaning agent is key to an effective clean cycle for your LG washing machine. There are several options, each with its own benefits. Understanding these choices helps you make the best decision for your machine. One popular and effective option is a commercial washing machine cleaner. Brands like Affresh or OxiClean make tablets or powders designed specifically for this purpose. These cleaners target detergent buildup and odors. You typically place them directly in the drum or detergent dispenser.

Another common household cleaner is liquid chlorine bleach. Bleach is a powerful disinfectant and odor eliminator. For an LG clean cycle, use approximately half a cup to one cup of liquid chlorine bleach. Pour it into the dispenser or directly into the drum. **Important:** Never mix bleach with other cleaners, especially ammonia or vinegar. This creates dangerous fumes. Bleach works well for sanitizing and removing tough odors.

Distilled white vinegar is a natural alternative, favored by many for its mild acidity. Vinegar helps break down mineral deposits and soap scum. It also acts as a deodorizer. For a clean cycle, use two cups of distilled white vinegar. Add it directly into the detergent dispenser or drum. Vinegar is safe for most machines. It leaves no harsh chemical residue. [How to clean LG washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washing-machine-with-vinegar) offers more specific steps.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your preference and the severity of the buildup. Some users prefer to alternate between a commercial cleaner and vinegar. This ensures a comprehensive cleaning approach. Always avoid abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals not designed for washing machines. These can damage internal components.

### Post-Clean Cycle Maintenance for a Fresh LG Machine

Once your LG washing machine completes its clean cycle, a few simple maintenance steps ensure lasting freshness. These actions prevent quick recurrence of odors and buildup. First, immediately after the cycle ends, open the washer door. Leaving the door ajar allows the interior to air dry completely. This prevents the humid environment where mold and mildew thrive. It is a crucial step for maintaining a fresh-smelling machine.

Next, pay attention to the door gasket, especially on front-load LG washing machines. Even after a clean cycle, water can pool in the gasket's folds. Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe down the entire gasket area. Make sure to pull back the rubber seals to access all nooks and crannies. Removing this residual moisture is key to preventing future mold growth. This simple wipe-down takes only a minute.

Finally, remember to wipe out the detergent dispenser drawers again. Sometimes, the clean cycle might not fully flush out all old residues or the cleaning agent itself. A quick wipe ensures these compartments are dry and free of any lingering gunk. You can also re-inspect the machine's interior for any remaining debris. Addressing these small areas ensures your LG washing machine stays optimally clean.

### Troubleshooting Common LG Washer Clean Cycle Issues

Even with a dedicated clean cycle, you might encounter minor issues with your LG washing machine. Understanding how to troubleshoot these can save you time and frustration. One common issue is an incomplete clean cycle. If the cycle stops prematurely, first check the power supply. Make sure the machine is fully plugged in. Also, verify that no error codes are displayed on the control panel. Some error codes indicate a specific problem that needs attention.

If your LG washing machine keeps beeping during the cycle, this often signals an issue. It could be an unbalanced load, an open door, or a drainage problem. While a clean cycle typically has no load, an open door sensor might trigger a beep. Consult your user manual for specific beep codes or warning signs. Sometimes, simply closing the door firmly can resolve the issue. [Why does my LG washing machine keep beeping during cycle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-washing-machine-keep-beeping-during-cycle) provides more in-depth solutions.

Another concern is if your LG washer still smells musty after running a clean cycle. This suggests a persistent buildup or an issue in areas not fully reached by the cycle. Re-clean the door gasket manually and thoroughly. Also, check the drain pump filter, usually located at the bottom front of the machine. This filter can trap lint and debris, causing odors. Cleaning this filter regularly is important for fresh results. If problems persist, consider running another clean cycle with a different cleaning agent. If you need to stop your LG washing machine mid-cycle for inspection, follow the proper steps to avoid damage. [How to stop LG washing machine mid-cycle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-stop-lg-washing-machine-mid-cycle) explains how.

If your LG washing machine appears stuck on a cycle, even a clean cycle, this indicates a potential glitch. Sometimes a simple reset can resolve the problem. Disconnect the power to the machine for a few minutes. Then plug it back in. This often clears minor electronic errors. If the issue continues, it might point to a more significant component failure. In such cases, contact LG customer support for assistance.

### Frequency and Best Practices for LG Washing Machine Cleaning

Maintaining a regular cleaning schedule for your LG washing machine is vital for its longevity and performance. The frequency of your clean cycles depends on several factors. These include how often you use the machine and the hardness of your water. I recommend running a "Tub Clean" cycle at least once a month. If your household does many loads of laundry each week, consider cleaning it more often. Some LG models even notify you when it's time to run a clean cycle, often after 30 washes.

Beyond the "Tub Clean" cycle, integrate a few best practices into your routine. Always use the correct amount of detergent. Using too much detergent leads to excessive suds and residue buildup. This is especially true for HE (High Efficiency) machines, which require very little soap. Refer to your detergent's instructions for the right measurement. I also suggest using HE detergent if you have an HE washer.

After each wash, leave the washing machine door ajar for a while. This allows moisture to escape and prevents mold and mildew from forming. Wipe down the door gasket and dispenser drawers regularly, even if you are not running a full clean cycle. These small, consistent efforts make a big difference. They keep your LG washing machine smelling fresh and working efficiently. Adopting these habits ensures your machine remains a reliable appliance.

Hard water areas may need more frequent cleaning due to mineral deposits. These deposits can affect heating elements and internal components. If you live in a hard water area, using a descaler designed for washing machines might also be beneficial. This can be done periodically in conjunction with your regular clean cycle. By combining regular deep cleaning with daily maintenance habits, you maximize your LG washing machine's lifespan and effectiveness.
