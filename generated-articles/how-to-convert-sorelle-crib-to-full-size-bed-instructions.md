## Sorelle Crib to Full Size Bed: Your Conversion Guide

Watching your baby grow into a toddler, then a young child, is a wonderful experience. This growth often brings changes to their bedroom setup. One common step is transitioning from a crib to a larger bed. Many families appreciate furniture that adapts as their child grows. This is where a convertible Sorelle crib becomes a true asset.

Converting your Sorelle crib to a full-size bed offers great value. It saves you the cost and effort of buying a brand new bed frame. You also extend the life of your initial furniture investment. This guide helps you understand exactly how to convert Sorelle crib to full size bed instructions. We cover everything from identifying your crib model to the final assembly steps. This ensures a smooth and successful bedroom transformation.

### Takeaway

Converting your Sorelle crib to a full-size bed is a smart move. Follow these key steps for a successful conversion:

*   Confirm your specific Sorelle crib model and get the correct full-size conversion kit.
*   Gather all needed tools like screwdrivers and wrenches before starting.
*   Carefully disassemble the crib, keeping all hardware organized.
*   Attach the new side rails from your conversion kit to the crib ends.
*   Place the mattress support and mattress for the finished full-size bed.

To convert a Sorelle crib to a full-size bed, you need the specific full-size conversion kit for your Sorelle model. This kit typically includes two side rails and possibly mattress support slats. You will use the crib's headboard and footboard to create the ends of the new full-size bed, attaching the new rails between them.

## Understanding Your Sorelle Crib Conversion

Converting your child's crib into a full-size bed is a practical way to meet their changing needs. Sorelle cribs are known for their quality and their ability to convert. This feature helps parents make the most of their furniture investment. It also ensures a familiar sleep space for the child.

Before you begin, understanding the conversion process is key. Each Sorelle crib model may have a unique conversion kit. Knowing your specific model helps you buy the correct parts. This section will guide you in preparing for a smooth conversion.

### Identifying Your Sorelle Crib Model

The first step in any conversion is finding your crib's model number. Sorelle typically places a sticker on the crib's mattress support frame or the inner side of one of the end panels. This sticker shows the model name and number. You might find it on the bottom of the crib as well.

Record this information accurately. It is essential for buying the right full-size conversion kit. Without the correct kit, the parts will not fit together properly. A specific model number ensures a perfect match for your Sorelle crib.

### The Essential Sorelle Conversion Kit

Once you have your model number, search for the specific Sorelle full-size bed conversion kit. These kits usually contain two long wooden or metal rails. These rails replace the crib's side panels. Some kits also include extra support legs or wooden slats for the mattress.

Buy the conversion kit directly from Sorelle or a certified retailer. Generic conversion kits may not fit your crib correctly. Using the correct kit ensures safety and stability for your child's new bed. This also protects your furniture warranty.

## Gathering Tools and Preparing the Space

Before starting any furniture project, proper preparation saves time and effort. Converting a Sorelle crib to a full-size bed is no different. You need the right tools and a clear workspace. This section outlines what to prepare for a smooth conversion process.

Having everything ready avoids interruptions. It also makes the assembly process safer. This step ensures you can focus on the task without searching for missing items.

### Essential Tools for Conversion

You will need a few basic tools to complete the conversion. Most Sorelle cribs use Allen wrenches and Phillips head screwdrivers. Check your crib's original assembly manual for a list of specific tools. If you no longer have the manual, look for a digital version online using your crib's model number.

Common tools include an Allen wrench set, a Phillips head screwdriver, and possibly a flathead screwdriver. A rubber mallet can also be useful for gently tapping parts into place. Make sure your tools are in good condition. Having the right tools makes disassembly and reassembly much easier.

### Clearing the Conversion Area

Choose a large, open area for the conversion. This space should be big enough to lay out all crib parts and the new bed components. Remove any carpets or obstacles that might trip you. Ensure good lighting in your workspace.

A clean, clear area prevents lost parts and makes the process more efficient. Consider placing a blanket or drop cloth on the floor to protect both your furniture and your flooring. Also, make sure to clean any dust or debris from the crib parts before you begin assembly. This prevents grime from getting trapped in the new bed frame. If you are preparing an old piece of furniture, you might want to consider how to clean used furniture to prevent bed bugs before conversion.

## Dismantling the Crib Safely

The conversion process begins with taking apart your Sorelle crib. This step requires care to avoid damaging the wood or stripping screws. Safety is important during disassembly. Always work slowly and methodically.

Keeping parts organized during this stage simplifies the reassembly later on. This section guides you through the process of carefully taking your crib apart. We will focus on saving the parts you need for the new bed. This part of the process is similar to taking apart any bed frame. For tips on disassembling beds, you can find information on how to take apart a bed frame with no screw, though Sorelle cribs generally use screws.

### Removing Mattress Support and Sides

Start by removing the mattress from the crib. Then, detach the mattress support springs or platform. Most cribs use bolts to hold the mattress support in place. Use your Allen wrench or screwdriver to loosen these. Carefully lift out the mattress support.

Next, remove the crib side rails. These are the long pieces that run between the headboard and footboard. You will need to remove the bolts connecting them to the end panels. Some cribs have a drop-side mechanism; ensure it is locked before attempting to remove the rails. Set aside the side rails; you will not use these for the full-size bed.

### Keeping Hardware Organized

As you remove each bolt, screw, or washer, place it in a labeled bag or container. It is a good practice to label each bag by the part it secures. For example, "Headboard bolts" or "Mattress support screws." This method prevents confusion later. You can use small plastic bags or an old tackle box.

You will reuse some of the crib hardware for the full-size bed. The bolts that held the crib side rails to the headboard and footboard often connect the new conversion rails. Keeping them organized saves you from a frustrating search. This step is crucial for smooth reassembly.

## Assembling the Full-Size Bed Frame

With the crib safely disassembled, you can now begin to build the full-size bed. This part of the process uses the crib's original headboard and footboard. You will connect them with the new side rails from your conversion kit. This section provides the steps to correctly assemble your new bed.

Proper assembly ensures a sturdy and safe bed for your child. Follow the instructions from your Sorelle conversion kit closely. Every model might have slight variations. Remember, patience makes the process smoother.

### Attaching New Side Rails

Take the two long side rails from your Sorelle full-size conversion kit. Position one rail against the inside of the crib's headboard where the old crib rail used to be. Align the holes on the new rail with the pre-drilled holes on the headboard. Use the appropriate bolts and washers from your sorted hardware to secure the rail. Do not tighten the bolts fully yet.

Repeat this process for the other end of the same rail, connecting it to the footboard. Then, attach the second new side rail to the other side of the headboard and footboard. Once all four connections are made, you can fully tighten all the bolts. Ensure the rails are level and secure.

### Installing Bed Slats and Support Legs

After securing the side rails, you will install the mattress support system. This usually involves wooden slats or a metal frame that rests on ledges inside the side rails. If your kit came with support legs, attach these to the center of the side rails or to a central support beam. These legs add stability and prevent sagging.

Lay the provided wooden slats evenly across the width of the bed frame. Many kits have pre-drilled holes in the slats and side rails for screws. Secure each slat if holes are present. This creates a solid base for the mattress. A well-supported mattress provides comfort and extends the life of the mattress.

## Finishing Touches and Mattress Placement

You are nearing the completion of your Sorelle crib conversion. Once the bed frame stands strong, the next steps involve setting it up for use. This includes selecting and placing the mattress. It also involves ensuring the new bed is safe and stable.

These finishing touches are important for both comfort and peace of mind. A proper mattress setup ensures a good night's sleep for your child. A thorough check ensures the bed will last for years.

### Choosing the Right Full-Size Mattress

A full-size bed needs a full-size mattress. Standard full-size mattress dimensions are typically 54 inches wide by 75 inches long. Measure your new bed frame to confirm it matches these dimensions. This ensures a snug fit. A mattress that is too small leaves gaps, which can be a safety hazard.

Consider the firmness and material of the mattress. For growing children, a medium-firm mattress often provides good support. Look for certifications that indicate low chemical emissions. This creates a healthy sleep environment. Once you have your mattress, lift it carefully onto the bed frame.

### Ensuring Stability and Safety

After placing the mattress, take a moment to inspect your new full-size bed. Walk around it and gently push on the frame. Check for any wobbling or loose connections. Tighten any bolts that feel less secure. Make sure all support legs are firmly on the floor.

Ensure no sharp edges or exposed hardware are present. Your child will use this bed for years. It must be completely safe. This final check is crucial for peace of mind. Regular checks of all bolts and connections are also a good practice for ongoing safety. After setting up, remember to consider how to clean under bed regularly to keep the space tidy.

## Troubleshooting Common Conversion Issues

Converting a crib to a full-size bed is usually straightforward. Sometimes, you might encounter small challenges. Knowing how to address these common issues saves time and frustration. This section covers typical problems and provides simple solutions.

Do not worry if a part does not seem to fit. There is often a simple fix. Being prepared helps you overcome these hurdles quickly. This ensures your project moves forward smoothly.

### Misaligned Parts and Stripped Screws

If holes do not align perfectly, first double-check that you have the correct side rails. Ensure you are not trying to connect them upside down or backward. Sometimes, a gentle wiggle or slight pressure on the rail helps. If a bolt still struggles, loosen other nearby bolts first. This allows for a small amount of play.

For stripped screw heads or bolts, stop trying to turn them. Continued force can make the damage worse. You may need a screw extractor tool. For damaged threads in the wood, a wood filler or a slightly larger bolt might be a temporary fix. It is always best to replace damaged hardware when possible.

### Missing or Damaged Hardware

Missing hardware is a common issue, especially if the original crib parts were not carefully stored. Check your labeled bags thoroughly. If parts are genuinely missing, contact Sorelle's customer service. Provide your crib model number and the specific part name or number. They can usually send replacement parts.

If hardware is damaged, such as bent bolts or broken washers, do not reuse them. Damaged parts compromise the bed's stability and safety. Order replacements directly from the manufacturer. Using non-standard hardware might void your warranty and risks the bed's structural integrity.

## Maintaining Your New Full-Size Bed

Your Sorelle crib has transformed into a full-size bed. This new piece of furniture will serve your child for many years. Proper care ensures its longevity and keeps it looking great. Regular maintenance also helps maintain its structural integrity and safety.

This section offers simple tips for keeping your converted bed in top condition. These practices will protect your investment. They also provide a clean and healthy sleep environment.

### Regular Cleaning and Care

Dust your bed frame regularly with a soft, damp cloth. Use a mild wood cleaner if needed. Avoid harsh chemicals, as they can damage the finish. For the mattress, consider using a mattress protector. This guards against spills and stains. Should any accidents occur, knowing how to clean bed stains can be very useful.

Vacuum under the bed frame often. This removes dust bunnies and allergens. Keeping the area clean promotes a healthier sleeping space. A clean bedroom contributes to overall well-being.

### Checking for Looseness and Wear

Over time, bolts and connections can loosen. This is normal with regular use. Periodically check all the bolts on your bed frame. Tighten them with the appropriate Allen wrench or screwdriver. A loose bed frame can creak and wobble. Regular tightening keeps the bed sturdy and quiet.

Also, inspect the wooden slats or mattress support for any signs of wear or cracking. If you notice any damage, address it quickly. Replacing a broken slat prevents mattress sagging. It also ensures proper support for your child. This proactive approach helps your bed last longer.
