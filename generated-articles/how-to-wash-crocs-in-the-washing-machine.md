## How To Wash Crocs In The Washing Machine Safely

My Crocs are a true comfort staple. From garden adventures to quick errands, they see a lot of action, and sometimes that means they get really dirty. Many people wonder, "Can I actually wash Crocs in the washing machine?" I am happy to tell you, yes, you can! Machine washing Crocs is a smart and easy way to get them clean.

This guide will walk you through the process, ensuring your beloved footwear stays fresh and lasts longer. We will cover important steps like getting your Crocs ready, picking the best washing machine settings, and drying them correctly. Follow these simple steps to bring back the clean look and feel of your favorite Crocs. You will find that keeping them fresh is easier than you thought.

### Takeaway

*   Pre-clean Crocs to remove loose dirt and debris.
*   Place Crocs inside a mesh laundry bag for protection during the wash cycle.
*   Always use a cold water setting on a delicate or gentle cycle.
*   Choose a mild laundry detergent without harsh chemicals or bleach.
*   Air dry Crocs completely, keeping them away from direct sunlight or heat sources.

### Concise Answer

Yes, you can wash Crocs in the washing machine. Place them in a mesh laundry bag, use a cold water, delicate cycle, and a mild detergent. Air dry your Crocs afterwards to prevent heat damage like shrinking or warping.

## Why Machine Washing Crocs Is a Good Idea

I find machine washing Crocs incredibly convenient. It offers a deeper clean than just wiping them down. Your Crocs collect dirt, sweat, and grime over time, leading to odors and a dingy appearance. A washing machine cleans inside and out, making them look and smell new again. This method saves you time and effort compared to hand scrubbing.

Some people worry about damaging their Crocs in the machine. Crocs are made from a special foam material called Croslite. This material is durable but sensitive to heat. Knowing the right settings makes machine washing safe. It effectively removes stubborn dirt and germs that a quick rinse might miss.

### Understanding Crocs Material: Croslite

Crocs are not like regular shoes. They use a unique closed-cell resin material called Croslite. This material is lightweight, comfortable, and resists odors. It molds to your feet and offers good support. Croslite is also non-porous, meaning it does not absorb water easily.

Because of this material, Crocs are easy to clean. However, Croslite reacts badly to high heat. High temperatures can cause your Crocs to shrink or warp permanently. This is why careful washing machine settings are very important. We must protect this special material to keep our Crocs in good shape.

### Beyond Surface Cleaning: Deeper Hygiene

When I machine wash my Crocs, I aim for a thorough clean. Wiping Crocs with a cloth removes surface dirt. But sweat and bacteria build up inside the shoes. These can cause unpleasant smells. Machine washing provides a deep sanitization.

The washing machine agitation, combined with detergent, reaches all crevices. It removes embedded dirt and effectively eliminates odor-causing bacteria. This deep cleaning keeps your feet healthier and your Crocs more hygienic. It is a vital step for truly fresh footwear, especially if you wear them often.

## Essential Preparation Before You Wash Crocs

Before you toss your Crocs into the washing machine, a little preparation goes a long way. This step protects both your Crocs and your appliance. Skipping these steps can lead to damage or an incomplete clean. I always take a few minutes for this important pre-wash routine. It ensures the best results every time.

First, you need to remove any loose debris. Crocs are great for gardening or beach trips. They can pick up mud, sand, or small stones easily. Getting rid of these items prevents them from scratching your Crocs or your machine. It also helps the detergent work better.

### Getting Rid of Loose Dirt and Debris

My first step is always to knock off any large pieces of dirt. I usually take my Crocs outside and gently tap them together. This dislodges dried mud or embedded pebbles. Then, I use an old brush, like a soft-bristled scrub brush or an old toothbrush, to clean the soles. The treads can hold a lot of grime.

A quick rinse under a faucet can also help. Just use cold water to wash away surface dust and loose grit. Make sure no small rocks are stuck in the drainage holes. These simple actions prevent dirt from spreading inside your washing machine. They also ensure the water and detergent focus on the stains that really matter.

### Protecting Your Crocs and Washer

Once the loose dirt is gone, I prepare my Crocs for the machine. Crocs can clatter around during a wash cycle. This clanking might damage the Crocs themselves or even the washing machine drum. To prevent this, I always place my Crocs inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag acts as a cushion and keeps them contained.

If you do not have a mesh bag, an old pillowcase tied securely can work as a substitute. Just make sure it is clean. This step is also crucial if you are washing multiple pairs of Crocs at once. It keeps them from bumping into each other too hard. Additionally, remove any Jibbitz™ charms from your Crocs before washing. These small accessories can come off in the wash and get lost or damaged.

## Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings for Crocs

Picking the correct washing machine settings is perhaps the most important part of this whole process. Using the wrong settings can ruin your Crocs. The goal is to clean them effectively without exposing them to damaging conditions. I always double-check these settings before pressing start. This careful approach protects the Croslite material.

My main focus is on water temperature and cycle type. These two factors directly affect the material's integrity. Heat is the biggest enemy of Croslite. A gentle cycle ensures your Crocs are cleaned without harsh agitation. This combination creates a safe environment for your footwear in the machine.

### Cold Water Is Key for Croslite

I cannot stress this enough: always use cold water when washing Crocs. Hot water is the number one cause of Crocs shrinking or warping. Croslite foam becomes pliable with heat. Once it reshapes due to high temperatures, it is often permanent. You do not want to end up with shoes that no longer fit.

Cold water effectively cleans without any risk of heat damage. It still activates your detergent and helps lift dirt. So, make sure your washing machine is set to "cold" or "tap cold" for both the wash and rinse cycles. This simple choice protects your investment in comfortable footwear.

### Gentle Cycle for Gentle Care

The washing machine cycle setting also matters a lot. I always select a delicate or gentle cycle. These cycles use less agitation, which is perfect for items like shoes. A strong, aggressive wash cycle can put too much stress on the Crocs. It might even cause them to rub too hard against the machine drum.

A delicate cycle prevents unnecessary wear and tear. It still provides enough movement to get your Crocs clean. Think of it as a gentle massage for your shoes. This setting ensures the material stays intact and the shape remains true. It is about being kind to your footwear while getting it spotless.

### The Right Soap Makes a Difference

Choosing the right detergent is a final but important step. I always use a mild laundry detergent. Avoid anything with harsh chemicals, bleach, or fabric softeners. Bleach can discolor your Crocs. Fabric softeners are not needed and can leave a residue. A simple liquid detergent is best.

Just a small amount is sufficient. You do not need much soap for Crocs since they do not absorb water like fabric. Too much detergent can leave a soapy film on the surface. If you are washing multiple items, consider the overall [how full should a washing machine be](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-full-should-a-washing-machine-be) to ensure proper cleaning and rinsing for everything in the load. I often use a detergent designed for sensitive skin or baby clothes. These are typically gentler and free from strong additives.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Washing Crocs in the Machine

Now that we have covered the preparation and settings, it is time for the main event. Washing your Crocs in the machine is a straightforward process when you follow these steps. I find that breaking it down makes it easy to remember. You will have clean Crocs in no time with this method.

I always approach this like a simple checklist. Each step builds on the last. This ensures nothing important is missed. Following these actions exactly will lead to the best cleaning outcome. You will see your Crocs transform from dirty to delightful.

### Loading Your Washer Correctly

First, open your washing machine door. Place your mesh laundry bag, containing your pre-cleaned Crocs, inside the drum. I usually put them on one side, not directly in the center. If you are washing other items with your Crocs, make sure they are compatible. I often wash them with towels or sturdy clothes to cushion them. Avoid delicate clothing that could be damaged by the Crocs' weight.

Ensure the load is balanced. An unbalanced load can make the machine shake too much. A few towels can help balance things out if you are only washing one pair of Crocs. This setup protects both your shoes and your appliance during the cycle.

### Adding the Cleaning Agent

Next, add your chosen mild liquid detergent. I pour it into the detergent dispenser drawer. Always follow the detergent's instructions for the amount. Remember, you generally need less detergent for a smaller, lightly soiled load. A small amount is plenty for Crocs.

Do not use powder detergents, as they may not dissolve completely in cold water. This could leave a residue on your Crocs. Once the detergent is in, close the dispenser drawer. Then, double-check your machine settings one last time. Make sure it is set to cold water and the delicate cycle. Now, you are ready to start the wash.

## The Crucial Step: Drying Your Crocs Properly

After the wash cycle finishes, the drying process is just as important as the washing itself. This is where many people make a mistake. Using a machine dryer can undo all your careful washing efforts. I always tell people to be patient during this stage. Proper drying ensures your Crocs keep their original shape and size.

I know it is tempting to speed up the drying. However, exposing Croslite to high heat is a recipe for disaster. The material is very sensitive. It can easily deform or shrink if dried improperly. This part needs your full attention to detail.

### Avoiding Heat Damage

My golden rule for Crocs is simple: no heat drying. This means no tumble dryer, no direct sunlight, and no placement near heat vents. Tumble dryers get very hot, even on low settings. This heat will cause your Crocs to shrink significantly. Once they shrink, they cannot be un-shrunk. They become unwearable.

Direct sunlight, especially on a hot day, also poses a risk. The sun's rays can heat the Croslite to damaging temperatures. This can lead to warping or fading of the color. Always keep your Crocs away from any source of high heat. Your goal is to dry them gently and naturally.

### Optimal Air Drying Techniques

The best way to dry your Crocs is to air dry them. Take them out of the mesh bag immediately after the wash cycle. Shake off any excess water. Then, find a cool, well-ventilated spot. I like to place mine in a shaded area outdoors on a breezy day. A laundry room or a spot near an open window also works well.

Make sure there is good airflow around the Crocs. You can place them on a drying rack or hang them from a line. Do not hang them by the strap, as this might stretch the material. Just let them sit naturally. Drying time will vary depending on humidity and airflow. It can take several hours, sometimes overnight. I usually give them at least half a day to ensure they are completely dry before wearing them again. This patience guarantees they maintain their perfect shape.

## Troubleshooting Common Crocs Cleaning Issues

Even with the best cleaning routine, sometimes issues pop up. Maybe a stubborn stain did not come out. Or perhaps your Crocs still have a faint odor. I have faced these challenges myself. But do not worry; there are solutions for most common Crocs cleaning problems. A few extra steps can make a big difference.

It is about knowing how to address specific problems. Crocs are durable, but they are not entirely stain-proof. And sometimes, persistent odors need more than a simple wash. I will share my best tips for handling these situations.

### Tackling Tough Stains on Crocs

Some stains are more challenging than others. Mud usually washes off easily. But oil, grease, or dye stains might need pre-treatment. For stubborn spots, I create a paste. I mix a small amount of baking soda with water. This forms a gentle abrasive paste.

Apply the paste directly to the stain. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. Then, gently scrub the area with an old toothbrush. After scrubbing, rinse the Crocs thoroughly with cold water. You can then put them through the washing machine cycle again. This targeted approach helps lift persistent marks effectively.

### Eliminating Lingering Odors

Even after a machine wash, sometimes a faint odor can remain. This usually means some bacteria lingered. Baking soda is your friend here too. After washing and drying your Crocs, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each shoe. Make sure it covers the footbed well.

Let the baking soda sit overnight, or even for 24 hours. Baking soda is a natural deodorizer. It absorbs odors rather than just covering them up. The next day, simply shake out the baking soda. You can also vacuum out any remaining powder. Your Crocs should now smell much fresher. For really strong odors, repeat the process.

## FAQ Section

### Can I wash Crocs with other clothes?

Yes, you can wash Crocs with other clothes, but choose wisely. I recommend washing them with sturdy items like towels, jeans, or blankets. This provides cushioning and prevents the Crocs from knocking too hard against the machine drum. Always place your Crocs in a mesh laundry bag first. Avoid washing them with delicate fabrics that could get snagged or damaged.

### How often should I wash my Crocs?

How often you wash your Crocs depends on how frequently you wear them and what activities you do. If you wear them daily, especially for messy tasks, washing them every few weeks is a good idea. For occasional use, a wash every month or two should suffice. I usually wash mine when they look visibly dirty or start to smell.

### What if my Crocs shrink?

If your Crocs shrink, it is usually due to exposure to high heat during washing or drying. Unfortunately, once Croslite material shrinks, it is very difficult to reverse the damage. You might try submerging them in warm (not hot) water to see if they regain some flexibility, then gently stretching them by hand. However, success is not guaranteed, and they may not return to their original size.

### Can I use bleach on Crocs?

No, I do not recommend using bleach on Crocs. Bleach can cause discoloration and damage the Croslite material. It can also leave streaks or permanently alter the shoe's color. Stick to mild, non-bleach detergents. For tough stains, try a baking soda paste as a safer alternative.

### Is hand washing better for Crocs?

Hand washing is a very safe option for Crocs, as it gives you complete control over water temperature and scrubbing intensity. However, machine washing is equally safe if you follow the correct cold water and delicate cycle settings. For a deep clean that saves time, I find machine washing more effective. For light touch-ups, hand washing works well.

### Do I need to remove the straps?

You do not necessarily need to remove the straps, as they are part of the Croslite material. However, if your Crocs have Jibbitz™ charms, you should always remove those before washing. The straps themselves are durable enough to withstand a gentle machine wash. They will clean just fine attached to the shoes.

## Conclusion

Keeping your Crocs clean and fresh does not have to be a chore. As we have seen, learning how to wash Crocs in the washing machine is a simple and effective solution. By following the right steps, you can enjoy perfectly clean footwear without fear of damage. From pre-cleaning to selecting the correct cold, delicate cycle, each step helps maintain your Crocs' shape and comfort.

Remember to always air dry your Crocs. This final, crucial step prevents shrinking and warping, keeping your favorite shoes looking great for longer. Now you know the best way to care for your Crocs.
