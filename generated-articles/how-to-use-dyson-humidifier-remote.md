When you first unbox your Dyson humidifier, the remote is often magnetically attached. This is a neat design feature, ensuring you always know where it is. The remote control provides full access to your Dyson humidifierâ€™s features. Knowing what each button does is the first step. Each button helps you tailor your environment.

Let's look at the key buttons you will see:

## Basic Controls: Power, Humidity, and Fan Speed

Mastering the basic controls on your Dyson humidifier remote is simple. These functions are what you will use most often. They help you quickly adjust your environment for comfort.

This simple action begins or ends the humidification process. Ensure your humidifier is plugged in and has enough water.
