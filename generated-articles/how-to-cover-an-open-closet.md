## How to Cover an Open Closet: Creative & Practical Solutions

Is an open closet causing a visual mess in your room? Perhaps you simply desire more privacy or want to enhance your room's aesthetic. Learning how to cover an open closet is a common challenge for many homeowners and renters. An uncovered closet can disrupt a room's flow and make it feel cluttered, even if the interior is perfectly organized.

I understand the struggle of an exposed closet. It often feels like a constant reminder of things that need to be put away or hidden. This article will explore various creative and practical solutions to cover an open closet. We will cover everything from simple fabric additions to more permanent structural changes. Our guide offers options for every budget and style, helping you transform your space into a more cohesive and serene environment.

### Takeaway:

*   Evaluate your needs for privacy, aesthetics, and permanence.
*   Choose from versatile fabric solutions like curtains or drapes.
*   Consider creative room dividers such as folding screens or sliding panels.
*   Explore DIY door installations for a more permanent look.
*   Integrate storage units or artistic elements to conceal the opening.

### How to cover an open closet?

To cover an open closet, you can use various methods depending on your budget, style, and desired permanence. Options include installing curtains, drapes, or blinds for a simple, temporary solution. More permanent fixes involve adding bifold, sliding, or barn doors, or even repurposing a bookshelf or decorative screen to conceal the opening.

### Understanding Your Open Closet Needs

Before you begin covering your open closet, it is important to understand why you want to cover it. Are you seeking more privacy, improved aesthetics, or better organization? Your primary goal will guide you toward the best solution for your space. I always start by considering what I want to achieve before diving into projects.

Considering your budget is also crucial. Some solutions, like curtains, are very affordable. Other options, such as custom doors, require a larger investment. You should also think about the permanence of the solution. Are you looking for something temporary, or do you want a long-lasting change?

#### Assessing Your Goals

*   **Privacy:** If your main concern is keeping your belongings out of sight, simple fabric covers or screens might be enough. These options quickly hide clutter. They also create a sense of order in a bedroom or living area.
*   **Aesthetics:** Do you want the closet cover to blend seamlessly with your room's decor, or do you want it to be a decorative focal point? The material, color, and design of your chosen solution will greatly impact the overall look. A well-chosen cover can enhance your roomâ€™s style.
*   **Organization:** While covering the closet hides clutter, consider if the solution will also improve internal organization. Some options allow for easy access, while others might make reaching items more challenging. Think about how you use the closet daily. Keeping the closet tidy first can also help; learn [how to deep clean your closet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-deep-clean-your-closet) for a fresh start.

#### Key Factors to Consider

*   **Budget:** Determine how much you are willing to spend. Curtains are cost-effective, while custom doors or built-in solutions are pricier. There are options available for every financial plan.
*   **Style:** Match the cover to your room's existing decor. A modern room might suit a sleek sliding panel. A bohemian space could benefit from a textured curtain.
*   **Space:** Consider the space around the closet. Bifold doors need room to swing open. Sliding doors are good for tight spaces.
*   **Installation Difficulty:** Some solutions are DIY-friendly, like hanging a curtain rod. Others might require professional help, such as installing complex door systems. I always appreciate a project I can tackle myself!
*   **Permanence:** Decide if you need a temporary solution or a permanent fixture. Renters might prefer non-damaging options. Homeowners have more freedom for permanent installations.

### Fabric Solutions: Curtains and Drapes

Curtains and drapes are perhaps the simplest and most versatile ways to cover an open closet. They offer immediate privacy and can significantly enhance a room's aesthetic. This method is often budget-friendly and easy to install. I've used curtains many times to hide unsightly storage.

You can choose from a vast array of fabrics, colors, and patterns. This allows you to match your existing decor or introduce a new design element. Curtains also offer flexibility. You can easily open them for access or close them for a tidy look.

#### Choosing the Right Fabric

*   **Weight and Opacity:** Light, sheer fabrics offer a soft, airy feel but provide less privacy. Blackout or heavy fabrics offer full concealment and can help with insulation. Consider how much light you want to block.
*   **Material:**
    *   **Cotton or Linen:** These are natural, breathable, and offer a casual, relaxed look. They come in many colors and patterns.
    *   **Velvet or Brocade:** These heavier fabrics add a touch of luxury and formality. They also provide better sound dampening.
    *   **Sheer Voile:** Ideal for a delicate, airy feel, allowing some light to filter through while softening the view.
    *   **Burlap or Canvas:** These offer a rustic or industrial look. They are durable and often inexpensive.
*   **Color and Pattern:** Select colors that complement your room's palette. Patterns can add visual interest or a playful touch. Consider solid colors for a sleek, minimalist look.

#### Rod and Installation Options

*   **Tension Rods:** These are perfect for renters or anyone who wants a no-drill solution. They fit inside the closet opening by adjusting pressure. They are easy to install and remove.
*   **Curtain Rods with Brackets:** These offer a more secure and permanent installation. You mount brackets to the wall above the closet opening. Choose a rod that matches your room's hardware.
*   **Track Systems:** For a clean, modern look, a track system allows curtains to slide smoothly. These are often used for floor-to-ceiling drapes. They give a very sleek appearance.
*   **Cafe Rods:** Smaller, decorative rods can be installed inside the closet frame. These are great for lighter fabrics or a tiered look.

#### DIY Curtain Ideas

*   **Repurpose Sheets:** Old bedsheets can be transformed into closet curtains with minimal sewing. Simply hem the edges and create a rod pocket. This is a very cost-effective approach.
*   **Fabric Panels with Clips:** Purchase fabric by the yard and use curtain clips to attach it to a rod. This eliminates the need for sewing. You can easily change the fabric when you want a new look.
*   **Macrame or Woven Hangings:** For a bohemian or artistic touch, consider large macrame or woven hangings. These act as decorative privacy screens. They add texture and warmth to your space.

Curtains are a simple yet effective way to [cover an open closet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-cover-an-open-closet). They offer flexibility, style, and affordability, making them a popular choice for many homes.

### Creative Room Dividers

Beyond traditional curtains, various creative room dividers can serve as excellent covers for open closets. These solutions add architectural interest and functionality to your space. They can transform a simple closet opening into a design feature. I love how these options can add character to a room.

Room dividers are versatile. They can be temporary or permanent. They come in many styles and materials. You can find options that complement any home decor.

#### Folding Screens

*   **Versatility:** Folding screens, also known as room dividers, are portable and do not require installation. You can move them easily as needed. They are perfect for renters or those who want a flexible solution.
*   **Materials and Styles:** Screens come in wood, bamboo, metal, or fabric panels. They feature various designs, from intricate carvings to minimalist frames. Choose one that matches your room's aesthetic.
*   **Pros:** They are easy to set up and fold away. They add a decorative element to the room. They offer instant privacy.
*   **Cons:** They might not provide full dust protection. They can be knocked over if not placed carefully.

#### Sliding Panels

*   **Modern Aesthetic:** Sliding panels offer a sleek, modern look. They operate on a track system, allowing them to glide smoothly across the opening. These are ideal for contemporary spaces.
*   **Space-Saving:** Since they slide horizontally, they do not require swing space like traditional doors. This makes them perfect for tight areas.
*   **Customization:** You can customize panels with various materials, including wood, frosted glass, or fabric inserts. This allows for a unique design.
*   **Installation:** Installation involves mounting a track above the closet opening. This might require some DIY skills or professional help.
*   **Benefits:** They offer a clean line and can be almost invisible when closed. They provide excellent coverage.

#### Beaded Curtains and String Curtains

*   **Light and Airy:** Beaded curtains or string curtains offer a whimsical, decorative way to cover an open closet. They allow light and air to pass through. They create a soft division rather than a solid barrier.
*   **Variety:** They come in many colors, materials (wood, plastic, glass beads), and lengths. You can choose a style that suits a bohemian, retro, or eclectic decor.
*   **Pros:** Easy to install with a simple rod. They add texture and visual interest. They create a sense of separation without completely blocking the space.
*   **Cons:** They do not offer full privacy or dust protection. They can get tangled.

#### Repurposed Materials

*   **Pallet Wood Screens:** Build a rustic screen using reclaimed pallet wood. This DIY project allows for creativity and a unique, distressed look.
*   **Old Doors:** Salvage old doors and repurpose them as sliding or folding screens. Paint them or distress them for a vintage feel. This adds character to your home.
*   **Fabric Art Panels:** Stretch decorative fabric over wooden frames to create lightweight panels. These can be hinged together or hung individually. They become an artistic statement.

These creative room dividers offer functional and stylish ways to cover an open closet. They provide privacy and enhance your room's design, often with unique flair.

### DIY Structural Additions: Hinged & Sliding Doors

For a more permanent and integrated solution, consider installing actual doors to cover your open closet. This approach provides excellent privacy, dust protection, and a cohesive look with your room's architecture. While it requires more effort than hanging curtains, the result is a professional, finished appearance. I find that adding doors really elevates the space.

Choosing the right type of door depends on your space, budget, and desired aesthetic. You can build simple doors yourself or purchase pre-made options. Understanding [how to measure for a closet door](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-measure-for-a-closet-door) is an important first step.

#### Bifold Doors

*   **Space Efficiency:** Bifold doors are made of two panels that fold in half when opened, then stack neatly against each other. This design requires less swing space than traditional hinged doors. They are a good choice for smaller rooms.
*   **Ease of Installation:** They come with a track system that mounts to the top of the door frame. The panels attach to this track and pivot hinges. Installation is straightforward for most DIY enthusiasts.
*   **Materials:** Bifold doors are available in various materials, including wood, MDF, and louvered designs. You can paint or stain them to match your decor.
*   **Benefits:** They offer a classic door look and good access to the closet interior. They provide full concealment when closed.

#### Sliding Doors (Bypass Doors)

*   **Minimal Footprint:** Sliding doors, also known as bypass doors, consist of two or more panels that slide past each other on a track. They do not require any floor space to open. This makes them ideal for narrow hallways or rooms with limited clearance.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Top-Hung:** The most common type, where the weight of the doors is supported by a top track. This allows for smooth operation.
    *   **Bottom-Rolling:** Less common for closets, where rollers are on the bottom. These are more often seen in heavier patio doors.
*   **Aesthetics:** Sliding doors offer a clean, modern aesthetic. They can be made from various materials like wood, frosted glass, or mirrored panels. Mirrored sliding doors can make a room feel larger.
*   **Installation:** Involves installing a double track system at the top of the closet frame. The doors hang from rollers on this track. This requires careful measurement and alignment.

#### Barn Doors

*   **Rustic Charm:** Barn doors are a popular trend that offers a unique, rustic, or industrial look. They slide along a visible top-mounted track, typically outside the closet opening. [How to make barn doors for a closet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-barn-doors-for-a-closet) can be a rewarding DIY project.
*   **Design Statement:** The exposed hardware and large door panels make a strong design statement. They add character and a focal point to the room.
*   **Space Requirements:** Barn doors require ample wall space beside the closet opening for the door to slide open fully. This is a crucial consideration before choosing this option.
*   **Installation:** Installation involves mounting a sturdy track system above the closet opening and attaching hangers to the door. This can be a moderate DIY project.
*   **Considerations:** They do not offer complete sealing, so some dust or noise might escape. They are best for closets where complete airtightness is not a priority.

Building or installing doors provides a robust and elegant solution for an open closet. It transforms the space into a tidy, integrated part of your room's design. This investment in time and effort pays off with long-term functionality and visual appeal.

### Utilizing Bookshelves and Storage Units

Transforming an open closet into a functional storage or display area is a clever way to cover it while adding utility to your room. Instead of just concealing the space, you make it an integral part of your room's organization and design. This approach is highly practical and can be visually appealing. I often suggest this method for small spaces where every inch counts.

This strategy works well for closets that are not primarily used for hanging clothes. It is also excellent for adding more storage to a room.

#### Built-in Bookshelves

*   **Seamless Integration:** Installing custom or semi-custom bookshelves within the closet opening creates a built-in look. This makes the closet appear as an intentional part of the room's architecture. It provides ample storage for books, decor, or collectibles. You can learn [how to build wood shelves in a closet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-build-wood-shelves-in-a-closet) for this.
*   **Design Flexibility:** You can design the shelves to fit your specific needs, including adjustable heights, varying depths, or even adding drawers at the bottom. Paint them to match your wall color for a cohesive look.
*   **Functionality:** Beyond storage, these shelves can serve as a display area. You can showcase decorative items, art, or even a small desk setup. This adds layers of functionality to the space.
*   **Access:** While the closet contents are mostly covered, items on the shelves are easily accessible. This provides both concealment and convenience.

#### Freestanding Storage Units

*   **Versatile Options:** Place a freestanding bookshelf, wardrobe, or a set of cubby organizers directly in front of the open closet. This provides an immediate cover and adds valuable storage space. This is a flexible option, especially for renters.
*   **Easy Setup:** Most freestanding units require minimal assembly and no permanent installation. You can rearrange them as your needs change.
*   **Customization:** Choose units that match your room's style and your storage requirements. You can find units with doors, drawers, or open shelves.
*   **Considerations:** Ensure the unit is stable and large enough to effectively cover the entire closet opening. Measure carefully to avoid gaps. Remember that accessing the original closet contents might require moving the unit.

#### Combination Approaches

*   **Bookshelves with Curtains:** Install bookshelves inside the closet opening and then add a curtain or screen in front of them. This offers the best of both worlds: organized storage and complete concealment when desired. The curtains can be pulled aside to reveal the organized shelves.
*   **Cabinetry with Doors:** For a more enclosed look, install kitchen-style cabinets or custom cabinetry within the closet space. Add doors to these units for a clean, finished appearance. This creates a highly functional and organized storage solution.
*   **Wardrobe Inside Closet:** If your "open closet" is more of an alcove, place a beautiful standalone wardrobe or armoire inside it. This acts as a complete furniture piece that fills the opening. It provides dedicated clothing storage that is fully enclosed.

Utilizing bookshelves and storage units not only helps you [cover an open closet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-cover-an-open-closet) but also maximizes the functionality and organization of your room. It transforms a potential eyesore into a valuable asset.

### Artistic and Decorative Approaches

Sometimes, covering an open closet is not just about hiding it, but about transforming it into an artistic feature. These approaches turn a utilitarian space into a statement piece. They integrate the closet cover into your room's overall design. I find these methods add a truly unique touch to any home.

This strategy is perfect for those who want their closet cover to be a conversation starter. It allows for a high degree of personalization and creativity.

#### Large Art Panels or Murals

*   **Statement Piece:** Commission or create a large art panel or mural directly over the closet opening. This makes the entire wall a focal point. The closet disappears behind a beautiful image or design.
*   **Removable Options:** For renters, adhesive wall murals or large canvases can be mounted in front of the opening. These are temporary and easily removed.
*   **Material:** Use stretched canvas, painted wood panels, or even high-quality printed fabric. Ensure the panel is large enough to cover the entire opening completely.
*   **Installation:** Mount the art panel directly to the wall or ceiling above the opening. You can use French cleats for a flush look.

#### Decorative Screens and Panels

*   **Intricate Designs:** Opt for screens with intricate laser-cut designs, latticework, or carved patterns. These allow for partial visibility but create a striking visual barrier. Light can filter through, creating interesting shadows.
*   **Materials:** Choose from wood, metal, acrylic, or even durable recycled materials. The material choice impacts the overall aesthetic.
*   **Hinged or Sliding:** These panels can be hinged together to fold or mounted on a track system to slide. This provides both flexibility and artistic appeal.
*   **Customization:** Many companies offer custom-designed decorative panels. You can specify the size, pattern, and material to match your interior design perfectly.

#### Macrame or Woven Wall Hangings

*   **Bohemian and Textured:** Large macrame or woven wall hangings offer a soft, textured, and bohemian way to cover an open closet. They add warmth and a handcrafted feel to the room.
*   **Variety of Styles:** Choose from simple knot patterns to complex, layered designs with fringes and beads. The colors can be neutral or vibrant.
*   **Installation:** Hang these textiles from a sturdy dowel or branch mounted above the closet opening. Ensure the hanging is wide enough to cover the entire space.
*   **Pros:** Easy to install, adds unique texture, and creates a relaxed atmosphere.
*   **Cons:** Does not offer full privacy or dust protection. It is more about aesthetic concealment.

#### Mirror Panels

*   **Illusion of Space:** Installing large mirror panels over the closet opening not only covers it but also reflects light and makes the room feel larger and brighter. This is a clever design trick for smaller rooms.
*   **Framed or Frameless:** You can opt for framed mirrors that match your decor or frameless mirrors for a sleek, modern look.
*   **Installation:** Mirrors can be mounted directly onto the wall or designed as sliding or bifold door inserts. They require secure mounting due to their weight.
*   **Benefits:** Highly functional, creates a sophisticated look, and enhances the room's spaciousness.

These artistic and decorative approaches allow your closet cover to become a focal point of your interior design. They blend functionality with creativity, ensuring your open closet is no longer an eyesore but an element of beauty.

### Temporary and Rent-Friendly Covers

For renters or those who need a quick, non-permanent solution, there are many excellent options to cover an open closet without causing damage to walls or paint. These methods are usually budget-friendly and easy to install and remove. I always prioritize these options when living in a rental.

They provide immediate privacy and help keep your space looking tidy. You can change them easily if your style or needs evolve.

#### Tension Rods with Curtains

*   **No Drilling Required:** Tension rods expand to fit snugly within the closet opening, holding curtains in place without screws or brackets. They are incredibly easy to install and remove.
*   **Ideal for Renters:** Since they cause no damage, tension rods are perfect for apartments or temporary living situations.
*   **Versatile:** You can use them with lightweight to medium-weight curtains. Choose curtains with rod pockets or grommets for easy hanging.
*   **How to Use:** Measure the width of your closet opening accurately. Select a tension rod that spans this distance. Twist to expand until it is firmly in place. Then, slide your chosen curtain onto the rod.

#### Adhesive Hooks and Command Strips

*   **Damage-Free Hanging:** Adhesive hooks and Command strips are designed to stick firmly to walls and surfaces but remove cleanly without leaving residue or damage.
*   **Lightweight Covers:** These are suitable for hanging lightweight fabric panels, decorative tapestries, or even string lights for a whimsical effect. They cannot support heavy curtains.
*   **Flexible Placement:** You can place hooks strategically to create unique curtain arrangements or to hang multiple panels.
*   **Application:** Clean the surface before applying the strips. Press firmly for the recommended time. Wait an hour before hanging anything. Follow product instructions for weight limits and removal.

#### Freestanding Screens or Room Dividers

*   **Portable and Versatile:** As discussed earlier, folding screens are excellent temporary covers. They stand on their own and can be moved or folded away as needed.
*   **No Installation:** They require no drilling, hooks, or permanent fixtures. Simply unfold and place in front of the closet.
*   **Variety:** Available in various materials and styles, from decorative wood screens to fabric panels. Choose one that complements your existing decor.
*   **Considerations:** Ensure the screen is stable and wide enough to cover the opening completely. They may not offer complete dust protection.

#### Adhesive Blinds or Shades

*   **Quick and Simple:** Peel-and-stick blinds or temporary paper shades offer a quick, affordable, and drill-free way to cover an open closet.
*   **Privacy and Light Control:** Many come in blackout or light-filtering options, providing good privacy.
*   **Installation:** Simply peel off the backing and stick the adhesive strip to the top inside of the closet frame. Trim to size if needed.
*   **Pros:** Very inexpensive, easy to install, and provide a clean look.
*   **Cons:** May not be as durable as traditional blinds. Aesthetics might be more basic.

These temporary and rent-friendly options ensure you can effectively [cover an open closet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-cover-an-open-closet) without committing to permanent changes or damaging your rental property. They offer practical solutions for immediate needs.

### Enhancing Organization and Aesthetics Post-Covering

Once you have successfully covered your open closet, the work is not entirely done. To truly maximize the benefits of your newly concealed space, focus on internal organization and external aesthetic enhancements. A well-organized closet behind a beautiful cover offers the ultimate solution. This final step brings everything together perfectly.

I always find that organizing the inside makes me feel even better about the finished look. A well-organized closet makes daily life easier. For a thorough cleanup, remember [how to clean out my closet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-out-my-closet) for efficient decluttering.

#### Inside the Closet: Organization is Key

*   **Declutter and Purge:** Before putting anything back, take the opportunity to declutter. Donate, sell, or discard items you no longer need. This simplifies organizing and makes future access easier.
*   **Maximize Vertical Space:** Install shelves, drawers, or hanging organizers to utilize every inch from floor to ceiling. This is especially important for maximizing storage in smaller closets.
    *   Consider [how to add shelves to a closet without drilling](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-add-shelves-to-a-closet-without-drilling) for quick, no-damage solutions.
    *   [How to clean closet organizing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-closet-organizing) can help maintain order over time.
*   **Categorize and Contain:** Group similar items together. Use bins, baskets, and drawer dividers to contain smaller items. Labeling these containers makes it easy to find things.
*   **Invest in Quality Hangers:** Use slim, uniform hangers to save space and give your closet a neat appearance. Velvet hangers prevent clothes from slipping.
*   **Lighting:** Add battery-operated puck lights or LED strips to illuminate the closet interior. This makes finding items easier, especially in deep closets.
*   **Aromatics:** Place cedar blocks, lavender sachets, or activated charcoal bags to keep the closet smelling fresh and deter pests.

#### Outside the Closet: Complementing the Cover

*   **Integrated Decor:** Ensure the chosen cover complements the room's existing decor. The color, texture, and style of the cover should blend harmoniously. It should look like an intentional part of the design, not an afterthought.
*   **Accent Lighting:** If your cover is a decorative panel or a unique door, consider adding subtle accent lighting around it. This can highlight its features and create ambiance.
*   **Surrounding Wall Decor:** Decorate the wall space around the closet cover. Add framed art, mirrors, or shelving units that tie into the cover's design. This makes the entire wall feel cohesive.
*   **Furniture Placement:** Arrange furniture in a way that respects the closet cover. Ensure there is enough space for doors to open or curtains to be drawn back.
*   **Personal Touches:** Add personal decorative elements near the closet. A small plant, a decorative stool, or a piece of pottery can make the area feel inviting.

By focusing on both internal organization and external aesthetics, you transform your open closet from a source of frustration into a functional, beautiful, and integral part of your living space. The efforts you put into covering an open closet truly pay off in enhanced home comfort and style.
