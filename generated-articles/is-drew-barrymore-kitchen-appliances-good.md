Proper maintenance is essential for extending the life and beauty of any kitchen appliance. Drew Barrymore's Beautiful line is no exception. While they are designed for daily use, simple care steps keep them looking and performing their best. I always remind myself that a little effort goes a long way.

For most appliances, regular wiping down with a damp cloth is sufficient. This removes fingerprints and light spills. Use a soft cloth to avoid scratching the surfaces. The matte and glossy finishes clean easily. This keeps their aesthetic appeal intact.

For components that come into contact with food, like blender jars or air fryer baskets, thorough cleaning is key. Many parts are dishwasher safe. Always check the user manual first. For manual cleaning, use warm soapy water. Rinse thoroughly and allow parts to dry completely before reassembling. This prevents food residue buildup.

Avoid harsh abrasive cleaners or scouring pads. These can damage the finish. Natural cleaning solutions are often effective and safe. You can use a mixture of vinegar and water for general cleaning. This helps remove grease and grime without chemicals. [Discover how to clean kitchen appliances naturally.](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-kitchen-appliances-naturally)
