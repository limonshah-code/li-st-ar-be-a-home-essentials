By the end, you will have a clear picture of its air frying capabilities.

### Clear, Concise Answer to the Main Query

Yes, the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer performs air frying exceptionally well. It uses advanced convection technology to circulate hot air, achieving consistently crispy and evenly cooked results for a wide range of foods, often surpassing the performance of many dedicated air fryers.

## Understanding the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Technology

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is not just a simple toaster oven. It includes advanced heating and fan systems. This appliance uses a powerful convection fan. This fan circulates hot air rapidly inside the oven chamber. This intense air movement is what cooks food evenly and creates crispy textures.

Breville calls this "Super Convection." It means the fan spins faster than in a regular convection oven. This increased speed forces more hot air around the food. The element behind this technology is crucial for achieving air frying results. It mimics the deep-frying effect but without the excess oil. Food cooks faster because the heat surrounds it from all sides. This also helps in browning and crisping food surfaces effectively.

The oven has multiple heating elements. These elements are located at the top and bottom of the cooking cavity. They work with the fan to provide consistent heat. The digital temperature control ensures accuracy. This precision is vital for proper air frying. If the temperature fluctuates, food may cook unevenly. Breville's Element IQ system also plays a role. It directs power to where it is needed most. This smart system helps maintain the correct cooking environment. It ensures that your fries or chicken wings come out perfectly crispy.

Knowing this technology helps us understand its performance. The design focuses on maximum heat circulation. This is the core principle of effective air frying. Without strong, circulating hot air, food just bakes or roasts. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer aims to replicate the crispiness of fried food. It does this by superheating the air around your meal. This makes it a serious contender for your air frying needs.

## Air Frying Performance: Crispy Results You Can Expect

When it comes to air frying, performance is all about crispiness and even cooking. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer delivers excellent results in these areas. I have used it to make a variety of air-fried dishes. Chicken wings come out with wonderfully crispy skin. French fries get golden and crunchy on the outside, while staying soft inside.

The key to its success is the "Super Convection" setting. This mode cranks up the fan speed. It surrounds food with intense, dry heat. This process helps remove moisture from the food's surface quickly. This is what creates that desirable crispy texture. Unlike a traditional oven, you do not need much oil. Often, just a light spray or toss with a teaspoon of oil is enough. This makes your favorite "fried" foods much healthier.

I have cooked frozen foods like onion rings and mozzarella sticks. They consistently turn out hot and crispy. Fresh vegetables also air fry well. Broccoli florets get slightly charred edges and a tender bite. Brussels sprouts become caramelized and delicious. The oven's large capacity also means you can air fry more food at once. This is a big advantage over smaller, basket-style air fryers. You can make a batch of fries for the whole family, not just one serving.

Preheating time also affects overall cooking. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer preheats relatively quickly for an oven of its size. For instance, to reach 400째F (200째C), it might take around 5-7 minutes. This is comparable to, or faster than, many dedicated air fryers. Knowing [how long the Breville air fryer takes to preheat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-long-does-breville-air-fryer-take-to-preheat) helps in planning your meals. The consistent heat and rapid air circulation ensure that food cooks evenly. You get fewer soggy spots or burnt edges.

## Versatility Beyond Air Frying: A Multi-Functional Appliance

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is not just for air frying. It is a highly versatile kitchen appliance. This oven can replace several other gadgets in your kitchen. It performs many cooking functions. You can toast, bake, roast, broil, and dehydrate.

Think about baking cookies or roasting a chicken. This oven handles these tasks with ease. Its precise temperature control is excellent for baking. The consistent heat ensures cakes rise evenly. Roasting vegetables or a small chicken also yields great results. The large capacity allows for cooking bigger meals. This is a significant benefit compared to smaller single-purpose appliances.

Dehydration is another feature that sets it apart. You can make your own fruit leathers or dried herbs. This saves money on store-bought dehydrated foods. Knowing [if you can dehydrate in the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-dehydrate-in-the-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer) adds to its appeal. This multi-functionality makes it a true workhorse. You do not need a separate dehydrator or toaster oven.

Many people wonder if the Breville Smart Oven Pro can also air fry. The answer is nuanced. While the Pro model has convection, the "Air Fryer" model has "Super Convection," which is optimized for air frying. However, with some adjustments, you can achieve good results with the Pro model as well. You can learn [how to air fry in the Breville Smart Oven Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-air-fry-in-breville-smart-oven-pro). The Air Fryer model, however, offers dedicated air fry settings and accessories. This gives it an edge for air frying specific foods. Its multi-purpose design saves counter space. It streamlines your cooking process. This versatility makes it a valuable investment for any kitchen.

## Ease of Use and Smart Features

Operating the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is quite simple. The appliance features intuitive digital controls. A clear LCD screen displays cooking settings. You select functions using dials and buttons. This design makes it easy to choose your desired cooking mode.

The oven has preset functions for common foods. There are settings for toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, pizza, cookies, air fry, reheat, warm, and dehydrate. These presets take the guesswork out of cooking. You select the function, and the oven suggests a time and temperature. You can always adjust these settings to fit your specific needs. This flexibility is a plus for varied recipes.

Using the air fry function is straightforward. You select "Air Fry" from the menu. The oven typically suggests a temperature of around 400째F (200째C). You then adjust the cooking time based on your food. The oven includes an air fry basket and a roasting pan. You place your food in the basket. The basket allows air to circulate all around the food for maximum crispiness.

The "Smart" in its name comes from its Element IQ system. This system automatically adjusts power to the heating elements. It ensures even cooking and precise temperature control. This means less need for you to open the door and rotate food. This smart technology simplifies the cooking process. It helps beginners achieve professional-like results.

Cleaning is also a consideration for any appliance. While not entirely hands-off, many parts are easy to clean. The air fry basket can be washed in the sink. You can also place [Breville air fryer basket in the dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-breville-air-fryer-basket-in-dishwasher) for convenience. Understanding [how to clean the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer) helps maintain its performance. The non-stick interior also makes wiping down spills easier. Overall, the user experience is smooth and efficient.

## Capacity and Size Considerations

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer offers a generous cooking capacity. This is one of its major advantages. It can accommodate a whole chicken up to 14 pounds. You can also fit a 9x13 inch baking pan. This size is perfect for families or for preparing meals in larger batches.

A larger capacity means you can cook more food at once. This saves time and effort. For air frying, it means you can make a substantial amount of fries or chicken wings. You will not need to cook in multiple small batches. This makes it ideal for entertaining or meal prepping. Many smaller, basket-style air fryers are limited to just one or two servings. The Breville oven eliminates this limitation.

However, its large capacity comes with a trade-off: size. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is a considerable appliance. It requires significant counter space. Before purchasing, measure your available kitchen space. Ensure it fits comfortably under your cabinets. Some kitchens with limited counter area might find it too big.

Despite its size, the design is sleek and modern. It fits well in most contemporary kitchens. It can become a focal point of your counter. It is important to remember that this is an oven. It is not a compact air fryer. Its footprint is similar to that of a microwave oven. This size contributes to its versatility. It allows it to handle baking, roasting, and air frying for larger quantities. If counter space is a premium, this is a factor to weigh. But if you value multi-functionality and capacity, its size is a benefit.

## Durability and Build Quality

Breville is known for its high-quality kitchen appliances. The Smart Oven Air Fryer lives up to this reputation. It features a brushed stainless steel construction. This gives it a premium look and feel. The materials used are durable. They are designed to withstand regular use.

The build quality is evident in the details. The control knobs feel solid and precise. The oven door opens and closes smoothly. The internal components, like the heating elements and fan, are robust. This attention to detail suggests a long lifespan for the appliance. Investing in a durable product means it will serve you for many years. It reduces the need for frequent replacements.

Customers often praise Breville products for their longevity. This oven is no exception. It is built to perform consistently over time. The company backs its products with warranties. This provides peace of mind for buyers. While no appliance is indestructible, Breville aims for high reliability.

The internal parts are also designed for durability. The non-stick coating inside the oven is resilient. This makes cleaning easier and extends the oven's life. The included accessories, like the air fry basket and roasting pan, are also well-made. They are designed to withstand high temperatures. They hold up to repeated use and cleaning cycles. This solid construction ensures that the oven remains a reliable part of your kitchen.

## Value and Investment: Is the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Worth It?

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer carries a higher price tag than many dedicated air fryers or basic toaster ovens. This often leads people to ask: Is the Breville Smart Oven worth the money? My answer is often yes, especially if you consider its multi-functional capabilities and superior performance.

This appliance is not just an air fryer. It replaces a toaster oven, a regular toaster, and potentially a dehydrator. Its ability to bake, roast, broil, and air fry with precision means you save money on separate appliances. It also saves valuable counter space. This consolidation of functions adds significant value.

The quality of its cooking results also justifies the investment. For example, its air frying performance is consistently excellent. The "Super Convection" system genuinely delivers crispy food. Many dedicated air fryers cannot match this level of performance or capacity. Its precise temperature control and smart features contribute to better cooking outcomes. This reduces food waste from poorly cooked meals.

Consider the long-term benefits. Breville products are known for their durability. This oven is built to last. A well-made appliance that performs multiple tasks can be a central part of your kitchen for years. This makes its initial cost a worthwhile investment over time. While it is true that [the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer does go on sale](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer-ever-go-on-sale) periodically, its regular price reflects its premium features and build.

For someone looking to streamline their kitchen, improve cooking results, and invest in a reliable appliance, the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer offers strong value. It is more than just an air fryer; it is a complete countertop cooking solution. Its versatility and performance make it a smart choice for many households.

## Tips for Maximizing Air Frying Results

Getting the best air frying results from your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer involves a few simple tips. These can help ensure your food comes out perfectly crispy every time. I have learned these through personal experience.

First, always preheat the oven. Just like a regular oven, preheating is crucial for consistent cooking. The Breville oven tells you when it reaches the set temperature. This ensures the food starts cooking in a hot environment. Preheating allows the "Super Convection" to work immediately.

Second, avoid overcrowding the air fry basket. This is perhaps the most important tip. Air frying relies on hot air circulating around each piece of food. If you put too much food in the basket, the air cannot flow freely. This results in steamed or soggy food, not crispy. Cook in batches if necessary. It is better to have perfectly crispy food in two batches than mediocre food in one.

Third, consider using a small amount of oil. While air frying reduces the need for oil, a light spray or toss can enhance crispiness. It also helps with browning. Use high smoke point oils like avocado oil or canola oil. You can put [aluminum foil in the Breville air fryer oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-put-aluminum-foil-in-breville-air-fryer-oven) for easy cleanup, but avoid blocking the air flow around the food. Make sure foil does not touch the heating elements.

Fourth, shake or flip your food halfway through cooking. This promotes even browning and crispiness. For fries or smaller items, simply shake the basket. For larger items like chicken pieces, use tongs to flip them. This ensures all sides get exposed to the circulating hot air.

Finally, adjust cooking times and temperatures as needed. Air fryers can vary, and so can food thickness. The Breville presets are a great starting point. However, always check your food for doneness. A food thermometer is a great tool for meats. Learning [how to use the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer-pro) effectively will lead to better results. With practice, you will master air frying in your Breville oven.
