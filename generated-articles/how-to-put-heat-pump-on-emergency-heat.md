## Activating Emergency Heat on Your Heat Pump for Instant Warmth

Imagine a cold winter night. Your heat pump suddenly stops delivering warmth. What do you do? This situation feels worrying, but your heat pump often has a backup plan: emergency heat. Knowing how to put heat pump on emergency heat gives you a way to stay warm when your main system struggles. It is a critical skill for any homeowner with a heat pump. This guide explains why and how to use this important feature safely and effectively.

### Takeaway

*   **Locate EM Heat Setting:** Find the "Emergency Heat" or "EM Heat" switch on your thermostat.
*   **Activate Manually:** Switch the thermostat to EM Heat when the heat pump fails or during extreme cold.
*   **Monitor Energy Use:** Expect higher electricity bills; emergency heat uses more power.
*   **Call for Service:** Use emergency heat as a temporary fix. Contact an HVAC professional for repairs.

To put your heat pump on emergency heat, simply locate the "Emergency Heat" or "EM Heat" setting on your thermostat and switch it on. This action activates backup electric resistance coils, providing warmth directly to your home. It bypasses the outdoor heat pump unit, offering a temporary heating solution.

### Understanding Your Heat Pump's Emergency Heat Function

Your heat pump is a wonderful device. It moves heat, rather than creating it, which saves energy. But what happens when it cannot move enough heat? That is where emergency heat comes in. It is a vital safety net for your home's heating system.

Emergency heat uses electric resistance coils. Think of them like the coils inside a toaster or an electric oven. They heat up when electricity passes through them. This directly heats the air that moves into your home. This process is very different from your heat pump's normal operation. Your heat pump uses refrigerant to extract heat from outside air, even cold air, and then releases it inside.

Emergency heat also differs from auxiliary heat. Auxiliary heat, sometimes called "aux heat," turns on automatically. It supplements your heat pump's heating when outdoor temperatures drop very low. Or it turns on when your heat pump performs a defrost cycle. The heat pump and auxiliary heat often work together. The system decides when to use auxiliary heat. In contrast, you manually turn on emergency heat. This means you tell the system to rely *only* on the electric resistance coils. It completely bypasses the outdoor heat pump unit. This feature ensures you have warmth even if the main heat pump unit has problems. You can learn more about how auxiliary heat works by reading if a [heat pump shuts off when auxiliary heat is on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-heat-pump-shut-off-when-auxiliary-heat-is-on).

### When to Manually Turn On Emergency Heat

Knowing when to use emergency heat is important. It is not for everyday use. It serves specific situations when your main heat pump system cannot heat your home. Using it correctly can prevent discomfort and potential damage.

One common reason is a compressor failure. The compressor is the heart of your heat pump. If it stops working, your heat pump cannot move heat. You might notice your outdoor unit is silent or not running. In this case, turning on emergency heat provides warmth. Another scenario is extreme cold. While heat pumps work well in cold weather, very low temperatures can make them less efficient. Below certain temperatures, usually around 20-30 degrees Fahrenheit, your heat pump might struggle. If your home feels cold despite your heat pump running constantly, emergency heat can help.

Icing on your outdoor unit can also be a sign. A little frost is normal, but heavy ice buildup means trouble. Ice can prevent the unit from working properly. You should never try to chip ice off your unit. Instead, turn on emergency heat to keep your house warm. Call a professional to inspect the unit. Sometimes, the heat pump gets stuck in a defrost cycle. It tries to melt ice, but the cycle keeps repeating. Your system will not send heat inside. Emergency heat provides warmth until a technician fixes the issue. If your heat pump is not blowing hot air, this is a clear sign that something is wrong, and emergency heat might be needed.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Activating Emergency Heat

Turning on emergency heat is usually a simple process. The steps depend on your thermostat type. Most modern thermostats make it easy. Always consult your thermostat's user manual for exact instructions if you are unsure. This ensures you do it right.

#### Digital Thermostats

Many homes have digital thermostats. These thermostats often have clear displays and buttons. Look for a setting or button labeled "Emergency Heat" or "EM Heat." Sometimes it is a physical switch. Other times, it is an option in a menu.

To activate it:

1.  **Locate the switch or button:** Scan your thermostat screen or body.
2.  **Toggle the switch:** If it is a physical switch, move it from "Heat" or "Off" to "EM Heat."
3.  **Select the mode:** If it is a digital menu, press "Mode" and cycle through until "Emergency Heat" appears. Select it.
4.  **Confirm activation:** Your thermostat screen might show "EM Heat On" or a small light might illuminate, often red or orange. This light tells you emergency heat is active.

#### Smart Thermostats

Smart thermostats offer more features and often control via an app. The process is similar but may involve more on-screen navigation.

To activate it:

1.  **Access the thermostat:** Use the physical thermostat unit or its mobile app.
2.  **Go to heating modes:** Look for "Mode" or "System Mode" settings.
3.  **Find "Emergency Heat":** Select "Emergency Heat" from the list of options.
4.  **Confirm choice:** The thermostat or app will confirm the change.
5.  **Look for indicators:** A specific icon or color might appear on the screen to show emergency heat is running.

Once activated, you should hear your indoor fan turn on. It will start blowing warm air. Do not be surprised if the air feels warmer than your typical heat pump air. This is normal since it is direct electric heat. Remember to know [how to change your heat pump from F to C](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-heat-pump-from-f-to-c) if your thermostat display isn't in your preferred temperature unit.

### What Happens When Emergency Heat Is On?

When you switch your heat pump to emergency heat, a significant change happens within your heating system. It is important to understand this change. It affects both how your home gets warm and how much it costs to stay warm. This mode provides immediate warmth, but it has specific characteristics.

The heating process shifts entirely. Your outdoor heat pump unit shuts down. It stops moving heat from outside. Instead, your indoor unit activates electric resistance coils. These coils are similar to those in an electric furnace. Electricity flows through them, making them hot. A fan then blows air over these hot coils. This warmed air circulates through your home's ductwork. This is a very direct way to create heat.

Energy consumption increases significantly. Heat pumps are efficient because they move heat. They use less electricity than creating heat directly. Emergency heat, however, creates heat directly. This process uses a lot more electricity. You will likely see a noticeable jump in your electricity bill. This is why emergency heat is a temporary solution, not a primary heating method. To understand more about energy efficiency, consider researching [if the COP of a heat pump can be less than 1](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-cop-of-heat-pump-be-less-than-1). It explains the heat pump's efficiency rating. For tips on reducing energy consumption, check out [how to make your heat pump more efficient](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-your-heat-pump-more-efficient).

You might also notice differences in sound and performance. Your outdoor unit will be quiet because it is off. The indoor unit fan will likely run continuously to circulate the heat. The air coming from your vents will feel hotter than usual. It is a more intense heat, similar to a traditional electric furnace. This tells you the resistance coils are working. Knowing these changes helps you confirm emergency heat is active and working correctly.

### Important Considerations and Precautions

While emergency heat is a lifesaver in a pinch, it comes with important considerations. Using it correctly and sparingly is key. Ignoring these points can lead to higher costs or delay proper repairs. Your safety and comfort depend on smart choices.

First, never ignore the underlying issue. Emergency heat is a temporary band-aid. It does not fix why your primary heat pump failed. If your heat pump is malfunctioning, a professional needs to diagnose it. Continuing to run emergency heat for extended periods can mask a serious problem. This might make the repair more complex or costly later on. Always prioritize getting your main system fixed promptly. If you are wondering how to tell if your heat pump is working correctly, there are some simple checks you can perform before resorting to emergency heat. Learn [how to tell if your heat pump is working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-tell-if-heat-pump-is-working) to identify issues early.

Energy costs are a major factor. As discussed, emergency heat consumes much more electricity than your standard heat pump operation. This is because it generates heat directly, rather than moving it. Be prepared for a higher utility bill if you use emergency heat for several days. Budget accordingly. Limit its use to truly necessary times.

Always call a qualified HVAC technician for diagnosis and repair. Do not attempt complex repairs yourself. Modern heat pumps are intricate systems. They involve refrigerants, high voltage, and complex electronics. A professional has the tools and knowledge to fix problems safely. They can identify the root cause of your heat pump's failure. They will suggest the best repair. Regular maintenance, such as [cleaning your heat pump coils](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-heat-pump-coils), can prevent many issues that lead to needing emergency heat.

Remember, emergency heat keeps you warm, but it's not a long-term solution. Treat it as what it is: an emergency measure. Once your heat pump is repaired, switch back to its normal heating mode to enjoy efficient operation again.

### Troubleshooting Common Emergency Heat Issues

Even emergency heat can sometimes present issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot basic problems can save you a service call. It can also quickly restore warmth to your home. Most problems are minor, but some need professional help.

One common issue is emergency heat not turning on. First, check your thermostat settings. Ensure it is correctly set to "EM Heat" mode. Sometimes, a simple setting error is the culprit. Next, check your circuit breaker box. The electric resistance coils draw a lot of power. They often have their own dedicated breaker. If this breaker trips, the emergency heat will not work. Flip the breaker off and then back on firmly. If it immediately trips again, a serious electrical issue exists. Call an electrician or HVAC professional.

Another problem might be the emergency heat not heating enough. Your home might feel cool even with emergency heat on. First, confirm the thermostat setting is higher than the current room temperature. If it is set too low, the system will not run. Also, ensure your indoor air filter is clean. A dirty filter restricts airflow, which reduces heating efficiency. Change it if it looks clogged. If these steps do not help, the heating elements themselves might be faulty. This requires professional repair. If your heat pump keeps turning on and off, it could indicate a variety of issues that might eventually lead to needing emergency heat. You can learn more about [why your heat pump keeps turning on and off](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-heat-pump-keep-turning-on-and-off) to understand potential underlying problems.

Sometimes, emergency heat turns off too quickly. This could be due to a thermostat malfunction or a safety cutoff. Some systems have high-temperature limits. If the system gets too hot, it will shut down as a safety measure. This often points to an underlying issue with airflow or a faulty component. Do not try to bypass safety features. If your emergency heat cycles on and off rapidly, or if it does not produce heat, call an HVAC technician. They can diagnose the exact problem.

### Transitioning Back from Emergency Heat

Once your main heat pump system is repaired and fully functional, it is time to switch back from emergency heat. This step is as important as activating it. Returning to your heat pump's normal mode ensures energy efficiency and optimal comfort. It also prevents unnecessary wear on your emergency heating elements.

The process of switching back is the reverse of turning it on. Go to your thermostat. Locate the "Mode" or "System" setting. Change the selection from "Emergency Heat" or "EM Heat" back to "Heat." This tells your system to use the outdoor heat pump unit again. The "EM Heat On" indicator light should turn off. Your outdoor unit should start running. You might hear the fan start and feel the familiar gentle warmth from your vents.

After switching, monitor your system closely. Ensure your heat pump is now heating your home effectively. Check that the outdoor unit is running and that warm air comes from the vents. Listen for any unusual noises. Observe if the temperature in your home reaches your set point. If you notice any problems, like the heat pump not turning on or not providing enough heat, contact your HVAC technician again. It means the initial problem might not be fully resolved or a new issue has arisen. Do not hesitate to call them. Your comfort and your system's health are important.
