### What is the process for installing a split air conditioner?

Installing a split air conditioner involves mounting the indoor unit, placing the outdoor unit, connecting refrigerant lines, drainage, and electrical wiring, then evacuating the lines and testing for leaks. This ensures efficient and safe operation of the cooling system.

### Understanding Your Split AC System Before Installation

Before you begin any hands-on work, it is important to understand what a split air conditioner system is. This knowledge helps you appreciate each installation step. A split AC system has two main parts. There is an indoor unit and an outdoor unit. The indoor unit, or evaporator, blows cool air into your room. It absorbs heat from the air inside your home. The outdoor unit, or condenser, releases this heat outside. It contains the compressor and condenser coils. These two units connect through refrigerant lines and electrical wires. A drainage pipe also carries away condensation from the indoor unit. Knowing how these parts work together is key. It helps ensure a smooth installation process.
