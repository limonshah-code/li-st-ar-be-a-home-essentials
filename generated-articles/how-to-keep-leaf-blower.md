To keep a leaf blower performing well, regularly clean its air filter, spark plug, and carburetor. Use the correct fuel type and stabilize it for storage. Store the unit in a dry, protected place, especially during off-seasons, to prevent corrosion and damage.

## Understanding Your Leaf Blower's Fuel Needs

Getting the right fuel is the first step to keeping your leaf blower running well. Most leaf blowers use a two-stroke engine. This type of engine needs a mix of gasoline and oil. Using the wrong fuel causes major engine problems. It can damage your tool quickly.

Always check your leaf blower's manual for specific fuel requirements. I always follow the manufacturer's advice. This ensures the correct oil-to-gas ratio. Using premium, unleaded gasoline is best. It should have an octane rating of 89 or higher. Avoid gasoline with high ethanol content. Ethanol can harm the plastic and rubber parts in your fuel system over time.

### Why Fuel Stabilizer Matters
Fuel begins to break down after about 30 days. This breakdown creates gum and varnish deposits. These deposits clog fuel lines and carburetors. I always add a fuel stabilizer to my mixed fuel. This keeps the fuel fresh for much longer, sometimes up to a year.

Stabilizer is crucial for engines that sit idle. If you plan to store your leaf blower for more than a month, use stabilized fuel. Run the engine briefly with the stabilized fuel. This allows the mix to reach all parts of the fuel system. This simple step saves you from hard starting issues later. Knowing [what gas your leaf blower uses](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-gas-does-leaf-blower-use) is key to its longevity.

### Proper Fuel Handling
Store your mixed fuel in an approved container. Keep it away from direct sunlight and heat. A cool, dry place is ideal. Never use old or contaminated fuel. Old fuel causes poor performance. It also damages engine parts.

I often label my fuel cans with the mixing date. This helps me track its freshness. Discard any fuel that is older than recommended, even with stabilizer. Fresh fuel keeps your leaf blower reliable. It helps avoid unnecessary repairs.

## Essential Cleaning and Maintenance Tasks

Regular cleaning is vital for keeping your leaf blower. Dirt and debris can clog parts. This reduces efficiency. It also causes wear and tear. I make sure to clean my leaf blower after each use. This prevents buildup.

The air filter is one of the most important parts to keep clean. A dirty air filter restricts airflow. This makes the engine work harder. It also leads to overheating. A clogged filter can cause your leaf blower to lose power. It might even refuse to start.

### Cleaning the Air Filter
Cleaning the air filter is straightforward. First, locate the air filter cover. It is usually on the side of the engine. Remove the cover. Carefully take out the air filter element. Most leaf blowers use a foam or felt filter. If it is foam, you can wash it with soap and water. Rinse it thoroughly. Let it dry completely before reinstalling. Felt filters usually need replacement when dirty. I check my filter often. I clean or replace it as needed. For detailed steps on [how to clean your leaf blower air filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leaf-blower-air-filter), follow the guide.

### Spark Plug Inspection and Replacement
The spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture. A fouled or worn spark plug causes misfires. It also makes starting difficult. I inspect the spark plug annually or if performance drops. Remove the spark plug using a spark plug wrench. Check for carbon buildup or damage.

Clean light carbon deposits with a wire brush. If the electrode is worn, replace the plug. Always use the correct gap setting for your new spark plug. Your owner's manual will provide this specification. A fresh spark plug improves starting and engine efficiency.

### Carburetor Cleaning
The carburetor mixes fuel and air. A dirty carburetor leads to many problems. These include stalling, rough idling, or not starting. Fuel left sitting in the carburetor can leave sticky residues. This clogs small passages. Cleaning the carburetor can be more complex.

If your leaf blower is acting up, a dirty carburetor might be the cause. I use a carburetor cleaner spray to clear minor clogs. For more severe issues, I might disassemble the carburetor. This allows for a deeper clean. Be very careful with small parts. If you are unsure, consult a professional. Learning [how to clean your leaf blower carburetor](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-leaf-blower-carburetor) can save you money.

## Proper Storage for Off-Season Protection

Storing your leaf blower correctly is essential. Improper storage causes damage. It can lead to starting problems next season. I prepare my leaf blower for storage every fall. This prevents rust and fuel issues.

The first step is to drain the fuel system. Old fuel can become stale. It can also leave sticky deposits. These deposits clog the carburetor and fuel lines. Run the engine until it runs out of fuel. This ensures the carburetor is empty. If your unit has a fuel shut-off valve, turn it off.

### Winterizing Your Fuel System
After draining, I add a small amount of fresh, stabilized fuel to the tank. I then run the engine for a few minutes. This flushes out old fuel and coats internal parts with stabilizer. This prevents corrosion. It also keeps seals lubricated. I do not leave a full tank of fuel. Just enough to circulate the stabilizer.

Alternatively, you can drain all fuel. Then, spray carburetor cleaner into the intake. This helps protect the internal components. Always follow your specific model's instructions for winterization.

### Protecting the Engine and Exterior
Before storing, clean the exterior of the leaf blower. Remove any leaves, dirt, or grass clippings. These can hold moisture. Moisture leads to rust. Check all screws and fasteners. Tighten any loose ones.

Store the leaf blower in a dry, protected area. A garage or shed is ideal. Avoid extreme temperatures. Keep it off the floor if possible. Hanging it on a wall saves space. It also keeps it away from moisture. Consider covering it with a tarp or a specialized cover. This protects it from dust and dampness.

Beyond basic cleaning, some advanced steps ensure your leaf blower lasts. These tasks are not needed as often. They significantly extend your tool's lifespan. I perform these checks once a year.

Inspect the fan or impeller for damage. Debris can sometimes hit the impeller. This causes cracks or chips. A damaged impeller creates vibration. It also reduces airflow. Minor damage might be fixable. Severe damage requires replacement. Ensure the impeller area is free of wraps. String or wire around the shaft can cause issues.

### Checking Fuel Lines and Primer Bulb
Over time, fuel lines can crack. The primer bulb can also become brittle. Inspect these components for signs of wear. Cracked fuel lines cause air leaks. This leads to starting problems. A damaged primer bulb won't draw fuel. Replace these parts if they show damage. These small components are crucial for fuel delivery.

I gently squeeze the primer bulb. I check for cracks or softness. I also look for any wet spots around the fuel lines. This indicates a leak. Replacing these parts is usually simple. It prevents bigger fuel system issues.

### Inspecting the Spark Arrestor
Many leaf blowers have a spark arrestor. This is a screen in the muffler. It prevents sparks from exiting the exhaust. This is a fire safety feature. Over time, carbon buildup can clog this screen. A clogged spark arrestor restricts exhaust flow. This reduces engine power.

To clean it, remove the muffler or spark arrestor cover. Carefully remove the screen. Clean it with a wire brush. You can also burn off deposits with a propane torch. Be very careful with heat. Make sure it is cool before reinstalling. A clean spark arrestor ensures proper exhaust flow. It keeps your leaf blower running efficiently.
