The biggest question Canadians have about heat pumps is their ability to handle extreme cold. Our winters can be brutal. Temperatures often drop well below freezing for extended periods. Modern cold-climate heat pumps are engineered to perform efficiently in these conditions.

Older heat pump models did struggle when temperatures dipped very low. This often led to them relying heavily on backup electric resistance heat. However, today's technology has greatly improved. New heat pumps can extract heat from air as cold as -25°C or even -30°C.

### Minimum Operating Temperatures

Cold-climate air source heat pumps are rated for impressive low-temperature performance. Many models retain 70-80% of their heating capacity at -15°C. They still provide warmth at -25°C. Below this point, their efficiency might decrease. They might also need supplementary heating. This is where your existing furnace, if you keep it, can act as a backup.

A dual-fuel system pairs a heat pump with a gas furnace. The heat pump handles most heating needs. The furnace kicks in only on the coldest days. This ensures continuous comfort and energy savings. This setup provides peace of mind for even the most extreme cold snaps. If you find your system struggling, you might wonder [why can't my heat pump keep up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-cant-my-heat-pump-keep-up).

### Supplementary Heating Strategies

Even with advanced heat pumps, some Canadian homes may benefit from supplementary heat. This could be an existing fossil fuel furnace or electric resistance coils. The "balance point" is the outdoor temperature where the heat pump's capacity matches your home's heat loss. Below this point, supplemental heat can help.

The goal is to size your heat pump correctly. This ensures it meets most of your heating needs. A properly sized system will minimize reliance on supplemental heat. This maximizes your energy savings. Professional installers assess your home's insulation and windows to determine the best system.
