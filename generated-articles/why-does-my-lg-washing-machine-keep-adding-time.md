## LG Washing Machine Keeps Adding Time? Here's Why!

I've been there: you set your LG washing machine for a quick load, but the timer just keeps ticking up. It feels frustrating when your laundry cycle unexpectedly extends, taking much longer than planned. Many LG washer owners often wonder, "Why does my LG washing machine keep adding time?" This issue can disrupt your schedule and hint at underlying problems with your appliance. Understanding the common culprits behind these extended cycles can help you diagnose and fix the problem. This guide will explore the various reasons your LG washing machine adds time and provide practical steps to get your laundry routine back on track. I will share common causes and simple fixes.

### Takeaway

*   **Overloading or Unbalanced Loads:** Redistribute clothes evenly. Reduce load size.
*   **Drainage Issues:** Clean the drain pump filter. Check hoses for clogs.
*   **Water Pressure Problems:** Verify water supply. Inspect inlet hoses.
*   **Excessive Suds:** Use proper HE detergent amounts. Run a rinse cycle.
*   **Sensor Malfunctions:** Reset the machine. Consider professional help.

Your LG washing machine keeps adding time because it detects issues during the cycle, like an unbalanced load, drainage problems, or excessive suds. The machine extends the wash time to correct these issues, ensuring proper cleaning and rinsing before moving to the next stage. This is a safety feature and a diagnostic indicator.

## Understanding LG Washer Time Management

LG washing machines use smart technology. They adjust cycle times based on various factors. This is how they ensure clothes get clean. Many modern washers have sensors. These sensors detect load size, water levels, and suds. The machine adjusts the cycle duration for optimal performance. This is why the timer can change. It is not always a fault.

When your LG washer adds time, it usually indicates the machine is trying to compensate for an issue. For instance, if the load is too heavy, the washer might add more time to properly agitate and spin the items. If drainage is slow, it adds time for water to exit. This intelligent adaptation helps maintain wash quality. It also protects the machine from stress. Understanding this adaptive process is the first step to troubleshooting. You can then identify if the time addition is normal or a sign of a problem. I find this feature useful for proper cleaning.

These washers are designed to be efficient. They try to save water and energy. Sometimes, saving water means extra time for sensing. They may extend rinse cycles to ensure all detergent is gone. Spin cycles might extend to remove more water. This adaptability can seem confusing at first. But it is part of the machine's design. It ensures your clothes come out clean and well-rinsed. This is important for fabric care.

## Unbalanced Loads and Overloading Concerns

One of the most frequent reasons your LG washing machine keeps adding time is an unbalanced load. When clothes gather on one side of the drum, it creates an imbalance. This imbalance causes severe vibrations during the spin cycle. The washer detects this vibration. It tries to redistribute the laundry. This takes extra time. If it cannot rebalance, it adds more water and tries again. This can happen multiple times. The timer will increase each time the machine attempts to correct the balance.

Overloading the washing machine also contributes to this problem. A load that is too large does not allow clothes to move freely. This makes it harder for the machine to balance the load. It also prevents proper agitation and cleaning. The washer might sense the heavy load. It then extends the cycle to compensate. It tries to ensure clothes get enough wash time. Always make sure you leave enough space in the drum. I usually leave about a hand's width of space at the top. This allows items to tumble effectively. It helps prevent imbalances. If your LG washer gets stuck trying to balance, it might even show error codes. Sometimes, it just keeps trying, adding minutes. If your machine is constantly shaking during the spin, you might want to check why it keeps going off balance. This can be a sign of worn components.

To fix this, pause the cycle. Open the door. Manually redistribute the clothes evenly around the drum. Remove some items if the load is too big. This helps the washer balance more easily. Restart the cycle. The machine should then proceed without adding more time. Proper loading is a simple fix for many cycle extensions.

## Drainage and Water Fill Issues

Effective drainage is crucial for a washing machine cycle. If your LG washing machine has trouble draining water, it will add time. The machine cannot proceed to the spin cycle until all water has drained. Blockages in the drain pump filter, drain hose, or house drain can slow this process. The washer will wait for the water level to drop. If it detects water still present after a set time, it adds minutes to the cycle. This ensures the machine does not spin with water inside. Spinning with water could damage the machine or create a large mess.

A clogged drain pump filter is a very common culprit. This filter collects lint, coins, and other small items. Over time, it can become completely blocked. This prevents water from exiting quickly. I make it a point to clean my drain pump filter every few months. It is usually located at the bottom front of the washer. Refer to your LG manual for exact instructions.

Similarly, a kinked or blocked drain hose can also cause drainage problems. Check behind the washer. Ensure the hose is not bent or crushed.

Low water pressure or issues with water intake can also cause cycle extensions. If the washer takes too long to fill with water, it adds time. The machine waits for the correct water level before starting agitation. Check your water supply valves. Make sure they are fully open. Inspect the inlet hoses for kinks or blockages. Sometimes, sediment builds up in the inlet screens. You can disconnect the hoses and clean these screens. If your LG washing machine keeps filling up with water endlessly, it might also lead to extended cycles.

These issues delay the entire wash process. They force the machine to add time while it waits for proper water levels.

## Excessive Suds and Detergent Use

Too much detergent is a very common problem that makes your LG washing machine add time. High-efficiency (HE) washing machines use very little water. They need specific HE detergents. Using non-HE detergent or too much HE detergent creates excessive suds. These suds can trick the washer's sensors. The machine detects too many suds. It believes the clothes are not fully rinsed. It then adds extra rinse cycles to remove the foam. This dramatically increases the overall wash time. The cycle might extend by 30 minutes or more.

I learned this the hard way myself. I used to eyeball my detergent. Now I measure it carefully. Always use the recommended amount of HE detergent. Check the detergent packaging for guidelines. The amount depends on load size and soil level. If you have soft water, you may need even less detergent. Soft water creates more suds. LG washers are very sensitive to suds. They are designed to be water-efficient. Excess suds can also leave detergent residue on your clothes. This is not ideal for clean laundry.

If you suspect suds are the problem, try running an empty rinse cycle. This helps clear out excess soap from the machine. You can also reduce the detergent for your next few loads. Observe if the cycle time returns to normal. Preventing suds is a simple step. It keeps your LG washing machine running efficiently. It ensures accurate cycle times. This also helps maintain the machine's internal parts. A clean machine performs better. Regular cleaning can prevent soap buildup inside the washer.

## Sensor Malfunctions and Electronics

LG washing machines use various sensors. These sensors monitor water levels, temperature, load size, and even suds. If any of these sensors malfunction, it can lead to incorrect readings. This causes the washer to behave unusually. An inaccurate water level sensor might make the machine add more water than needed. It could also make the machine wait endlessly for the correct level. Both situations extend the cycle time. The machine might add time to try and get a proper reading.

The main control board manages all these sensors. It also controls the cycle timing. A glitch in the control board can lead to erratic behavior. This includes unexpected time additions. Sometimes, a simple power reset can fix minor electronic glitches. Unplug the washer from the wall outlet. Wait for about five to ten minutes. Then plug it back in. This clears the machine's memory. It allows the control board to reboot. This often resolves temporary sensor errors.

If the problem persists, a sensor might need replacement. Or, the control board could be faulty. These are more complex repairs. They often require professional assistance. LG washers are smart appliances. They rely heavily on their electronic components. When these parts do not communicate correctly, the washer struggles. It tries to compensate by adding time. This is its way of trying to complete the wash cycle correctly. For example, if your LG washing machine gets stuck on the spin cycle, it could be a sensor issue. [Discover why your LG washing machine gets stuck on the spin cycle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-washing-machine-get-stuck-on-the-spin-cycle). Or, if it gets stuck on a specific time, like 7 minutes, it points to a specific issue.

## Spin and Rinse Cycle Problems

Issues during the spin or rinse cycles are major contributors to extended wash times. The machine adds time when it struggles to complete these stages. For example, if your LG washing machine is not rinsing and spinning effectively, it will try again and again. [Find out why your LG washing machine is not rinsing and spinning](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-washing-machine-not-rinsing-and-spinning). This causes the timer to increase significantly. The washer needs to remove as much water as possible before the cycle finishes. This prepares clothes for drying.

During the rinse cycle, the machine ensures all detergent is gone. If it detects remaining suds or believes the clothes are not clean enough, it will add more rinses. This extends the cycle. A common cause is too much detergent, as mentioned before. But it can also be a water pressure issue. If the water flow for rinsing is too weak, the machine might take longer.

For the spin cycle, an unbalanced load is the primary culprit. If the machine cannot balance the load, it cannot reach high spin speeds. It will stop, redistribute, and try spinning again. Each attempt adds minutes to the cycle. This process repeats until the machine either successfully spins or gives up. If it gives up, clothes remain wet. This is why addressing imbalances is critical. Worn shock absorbers or suspension rods can also affect spin. They prevent the drum from stabilizing properly during high-speed rotation. These parts absorb vibrations. If they fail, the machine struggles to spin correctly.

Regular maintenance can prevent some of these issues. Cleaning the drain filter helps ensure proper water removal. Using the correct detergent prevents excessive suds. Proper loading techniques avoid imbalances. These steps contribute to smooth, timely cycles. If the problem persists, you might need a service technician to check internal components.

## Maintenance and Prevention Tips

Regular maintenance is key to preventing your LG washing machine from adding time unexpectedly. A well-maintained appliance runs efficiently. It is less likely to encounter common issues. I make sure to follow a consistent maintenance schedule for my washer. This includes cleaning various components. It also involves being mindful of how I use the machine daily.

First, always use the correct detergent. For LG HE washing machines, always use HE detergent. Use the recommended amount. Overdosing detergent creates suds problems. This can extend rinse cycles. It also leads to residue buildup. I use a measuring cup for accuracy.

Second, clean the drain pump filter regularly. This filter catches lint and small items. A clogged filter restricts drainage. This causes water to back up. It forces the machine to add time. You should clean it every few months. Refer to your owner's manual for its location. Most are at the bottom front. It is a simple task that prevents many headaches.

Third, clean the washer drum itself. Detergent residue, fabric softener, and hard water minerals can build up inside. This can affect sensor readings. It can also cause odors. LG recommends running a Tub Clean cycle monthly. You can also use washing machine cleaner or vinegar. [Discover how to clean your washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-vinegar). This keeps the drum fresh and functioning optimally.

Fourth, check water inlet hoses and screens. Sediment can build up in the screens. This restricts water flow. Reduced water flow makes the washer take longer to fill. Check these annually. Clean them if necessary. Finally, avoid overloading. Give your clothes room to tumble. This helps prevent unbalanced loads. It ensures efficient washing and spinning. By following these tips, you can keep your LG washer running smoothly. You can minimize unexpected cycle extensions.

## When to Call a Professional

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your LG washing machine continues to add time. This indicates a more serious underlying problem. Knowing when to call a professional technician is important. It prevents further damage to your appliance. It also ensures safety. I know my limits when it comes to appliance repair.

If you have tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned and the problem persists, professional help is likely needed. For example, you have checked for unbalanced loads. You have cleaned all filters. You have confirmed water supply. Yet, the cycle still extends unexpectedly. This suggests a component failure.

Specific issues that warrant a service call include:
*   **Persistent Error Codes:** If your LG washer displays error codes related to drainage, motor, or sensor issues after you have performed basic troubleshooting, it is time for a professional diagnosis.
*   **Unusual Noises:** Grinding, clanking, or loud thumping noises during operation might indicate motor problems or issues with the drum bearings. These require expert repair.
*   **Water Leaks:** Any water leaking from the machine during a cycle is a serious concern. It could be a hose, pump, or tub seal problem. This requires immediate attention.
*   **Complete Cycle Failure:** If the washer simply stops mid-cycle and refuses to proceed, even after a reset, a technician can identify the root cause.
*   **Sensor or Control Board Malfunction:** Diagnosing and replacing faulty sensors or the main control board requires specialized tools and knowledge. Attempting these repairs yourself can void your warranty or cause more damage.

A qualified appliance technician has the tools and experience. They can accurately diagnose complex issues. They can safely replace faulty parts. They will ensure your LG washing machine returns to optimal performance. Do not hesitate to seek expert help when basic fixes are not enough. Protecting your investment is important.
