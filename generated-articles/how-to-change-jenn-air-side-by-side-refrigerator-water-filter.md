## Changing Your Jenn Air Refrigerator Water Filter

Has your Jenn Air side by side refrigerator's water dispenser slowed down? Perhaps the ice tastes a bit off? These are clear signs it is time to change your Jenn Air water filter. Maintaining a clean water filter is important for your health and your appliance. It ensures your family enjoys fresh, clean water and ice. This guide provides steps to help you change your Jenn Air side by side refrigerator water filter. I will walk you through everything you need to know. We will cover finding the right filter and solving common issues after installation.

### Takeaway

*   Replace your Jenn Air water filter every six months for best performance.
*   Identify your specific filter type and location before starting.
*   Gather tools like a small towel and the new filter before you begin.
*   Flush the new filter for several minutes to remove air and carbon fines.

To change your Jenn Air side by side refrigerator water filter, locate the filter cartridge inside the refrigerator compartment or in the base grille. Turn the old filter counter-clockwise to remove it. Insert the new filter and turn it clockwise until it locks. Run water through the dispenser for 3-5 minutes to flush the system.

## Why Change Your Jenn Air Refrigerator Water Filter?

Changing your Jenn Air refrigerator water filter is more than a chore. It is a vital task for your health. A fresh filter provides clean, filtered water for drinking and ice. Over time, filters collect impurities from your water supply. This includes chlorine, sediment, and other contaminants. A clogged filter cannot trap these particles. This means they end up in your drinking water.

Ignoring the filter replacement warning light leads to several problems. First, water flow from the dispenser often slows down. You might notice a strange taste or smell in your water and ice. These are clear signs the filter is no longer doing its job. A dirty filter also puts strain on your refrigerator's water system. This can lead to decreased efficiency. It might even cause more serious problems over time. Regular replacement maintains the lifespan of your appliance. It also keeps your water tasting great.

Think of the filter as a screen. It catches unwanted particles. When the screen fills, nothing can pass cleanly. Water quality directly affects your well-being. Using clean water for cooking and drinking is important. It helps avoid health issues from contaminants. I prioritize changing my filter on schedule. This gives me peace of mind. It ensures my family always has access to pure water.

## Locating Your Jenn Air Side By Side Water Filter

Finding the water filter on your Jenn Air side by side refrigerator is the first step. Jenn Air refrigerators place filters in different spots. The location often depends on the specific model. Knowing where to look saves you time and effort. Most Jenn Air side by side models have the filter in one of two common places.

One popular location is inside the fresh food compartment. You might find it in the upper right corner. It can be a cylindrical or disc-shaped cartridge. Sometimes it is behind a small cover. Another common spot is in the base grille at the bottom front of the refrigerator. This location is usually marked by a small door or panel. You might need to kneel down to see it. Some older models might have the filter at the back. However, this is less common for side by side units.

To pinpoint your filter, check your refrigerator's owner's manual. The manual shows exact diagrams and instructions. It also tells you the specific part number for your filter. If you do not have the manual, look for a filter indicator light on your dispenser panel. This light tells you when to change the filter. Once you find the filter, note its orientation. This helps you insert the new one correctly. Understanding the filter's home simplifies the replacement process. I always consult my manual first for specific details about my model.

## Choosing the Right Jenn Air Water Filter

Selecting the correct replacement water filter is important. Using the wrong filter can cause issues. It might not fit properly, or it might not filter water effectively. Jenn Air refrigerators use specific filter models. These are designed to work with your appliance. There are a few things to consider when buying a new filter.

First, identify your current filter's model number. This number is usually printed on the filter itself. It can also be found in your refrigerator's owner's manual. Jenn Air filters often start with "P" or "W." For example, you might see "PBF" or "W10295370." Knowing this exact number ensures you get a perfect match. You can buy genuine Jenn Air filters. These are original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts. They guarantee compatibility and performance.

You can also find compatible or "aftermarket" filters. These filters are made by other companies. They are designed to fit Jenn Air refrigerators. Many compatible filters offer similar filtration performance. They often come at a lower price. If you choose a compatible filter, check reviews carefully. Ensure it is certified to meet NSF standards for water filtration. NSF International is a public health and safety organization. Their certification means the filter removes specified contaminants. I prefer sticking to OEM filters or highly-rated NSF-certified compatibles. This gives me confidence in the water quality. It helps prevent problems like [water dispenser not working after filter replacement](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kitchenaid-refrigerator-water-dispenser-not-working-after-replacing-filter).

## Tools and Supplies for Filter Replacement

Changing your Jenn Air water filter is a simple DIY task. You do not need many tools. Having the right items ready makes the job quick and easy. Before you start, gather these basic supplies. This preparation prevents interruptions during the process.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **New Jenn Air Water Filter:** This is the most important item. Ensure it is the correct model for your refrigerator.
*   **Small Towel or Cloth:** Water can drip during the filter change. A towel catches any spills. This prevents water from going onto the floor or inside your refrigerator. I always have a few on hand.
*   **Shallow Pan or Bowl (Optional):** If your filter is in the base grille, a pan can catch more significant drips. This is especially helpful if you expect a lot of residual water.
*   **Owner's Manual (Optional but Recommended):** Your manual provides specific instructions for your model. It often includes diagrams. This can be very useful if you are unsure about the steps.

You usually do not need special wrenches or tools. Most Jenn Air filters use a simple twist-and-lock mechanism. Some models might require a slight push before twisting. Prepare your workspace. Clear any items from the area around the filter. This gives you room to work comfortably. Having everything ready saves time. It makes the filter replacement process smooth and hassle-free.

## Step-by-Step Filter Replacement Guide

Now, let us get to the core task: changing your Jenn Air side by side refrigerator water filter. The process is straightforward, but steps can vary slightly based on filter location. I will cover the most common methods. Follow these steps carefully for a successful replacement.

### Changing a Filter in the Base Grille

Many Jenn Air side by side models have the filter in the bottom front grille.

1.  **Turn Off Water Supply (Optional but Recommended):** While not always strictly necessary for filter changes, turning off the water supply to the refrigerator is a good safety measure. This prevents unexpected leaks. You can usually find the shut-off valve behind the fridge or under your sink. Some refrigerators like LG allow you to change filters without turning off the water, but it is safer to do so for Jenn Air models to avoid splashes.
2.  **Locate and Open Filter Cover:** Kneel in front of your refrigerator. Look for a small round or rectangular cover in the base grille. Push or pull the latch to open it.
3.  **Twist and Remove Old Filter:** The old filter will be visible. It might have a push-button release or a simple twist mechanism. For most Jenn Air base grille filters, twist the filter counter-clockwise a quarter turn. It should then release and slide out. Have your towel ready to catch any drips.
4.  **Insert New Filter:** Remove the protective cap from the new filter. Align the new filter with the housing. Push it in firmly. Turn it clockwise a quarter turn until it locks into place. You should feel it click.
5.  **Close Cover:** Close the filter cover securely.
6.  **Turn On Water Supply:** If you turned off the water, open the shut-off valve.

### Changing a Filter Inside the Refrigerator

Some Jenn Air side by side models have the filter inside the fresh food compartment.

1.  **Locate Filter Housing:** Open the fresh food door. Look for the filter in the upper right corner or possibly on a shelf. It might be behind a hinged cover.
2.  **Twist and Remove Old Filter:** Twist the filter counter-clockwise until it releases from its housing. Pull it straight out. Have a towel underneath to catch drips.
3.  **Insert New Filter:** Take the new filter and remove its protective cap. Push the new filter into the housing firmly. Turn it clockwise until it locks into place. You should feel a click.
4.  **Close Cover (If Applicable):** If there was a cover, close it.

### Flushing the System

This is a critical step after replacing any water filter. It removes air from the water lines and carbon fines from the new filter.

1.  **Dispense Water:** Place a large container under the water dispenser. Dispense water for 3 to 5 minutes. You might notice sputtering or air bubbles at first. This is normal.
2.  **Check for Clarity:** The water should become clear and steady. If not, continue dispensing until it is. This flushing process ensures the best taste and flow. It also prevents [refrigerator water dispenser mold](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-refrigerator-water-dispenser-mold) by ensuring all components are properly flushed.
3.  **Reset Filter Indicator Light:** Most Jenn Air models have a filter reset button. This button is usually on the dispenser panel. Press and hold it for about 3 seconds until the light turns off. Consult your manual for specific reset instructions if you cannot find it.

## Troubleshooting After Replacing Your Jenn Air Filter

You might encounter minor issues after changing your Jenn Air side by side refrigerator water filter. Do not worry. Most problems have simple solutions. I have faced these myself. Here are common issues and how to fix them.

### Water Dispenser Not Working or Slow Flow

This is a frequent complaint. If your water flow is weak or nonexistent:

*   **Check Water Shut-off Valve:** Ensure the water supply valve to your refrigerator is fully open. If you closed it during the filter change, make sure it is completely reopened.
*   **Flush the System Again:** Air pockets can get trapped in the lines. Dispense water for another 5 minutes. This helps clear any remaining air. You might hear gurgling sounds as air escapes.
*   **Re-seat the Filter:** Sometimes, the filter is not fully seated. Remove the new filter and reinsert it. Ensure it clicks firmly into place. A loose connection prevents water flow. Problems like this are common across brands. For example, [troubleshooting a KitchenAid water dispenser](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-kitchenaid-refrigerator-water-dispenser-not-working-after-replacing-filter) often involves similar steps.
*   **Check Water Pressure:** Low household water pressure can also affect dispenser performance. This is less common immediately after a filter change. Still, it is worth considering if other faucets in your home have low pressure.

### Leaking Water After Filter Change

A small drip during the change is normal. Continuous leaking needs attention.

*   **Check Filter Seating:** The most common cause of leaks is an improperly installed filter. Remove the filter. Inspect the O-rings on the new filter. Ensure they are not pinched or twisted. Reinsert the filter, making sure it twists and locks securely into its housing.
*   **Inspect Housing:** Look for cracks or damage on the filter housing itself. This is rare but can happen. If you find damage, you might need a service professional.
*   **Check Water Lines:** Ensure no water lines leading to the refrigerator or dispenser were dislodged. Sometimes, moving the fridge slightly can loosen connections. Be mindful of potential issues like a [Whirlpool side by side refrigerator leaking water from the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-whirlpool-side-by-side-refrigerator-leaking-water-from-the-bottom) if leaks persist.

### Strange Taste or Odor in Water

This indicates the filter is not working or needs more flushing.

*   **Flush More Water:** New carbon filters release fine carbon particles. This can cause a cloudy appearance or a slight taste. Flush several more gallons of water through the dispenser. This usually clears it up.
*   **Verify Filter Type:** Double-check that you installed the correct filter for your model. An incorrect filter may not remove contaminants effectively.
*   **Check Filter Installation Date:** Ensure the filter is new and not past its shelf life. Old filters might not perform as expected. If you need to know [how to clean a water filter in the fridge](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-water-filter-in-fridge), it often refers to external parts or reservoirs, as the internal filter is disposable.

Remember, patience is key. Most post-replacement issues resolve with a little troubleshooting.

## Maintaining Your Jenn Air Refrigerator for Optimal Water Quality

Changing the water filter is a big step. However, it is part of a larger maintenance routine. Regular care ensures your Jenn Air side by side refrigerator provides clean water consistently. It also keeps your appliance running efficiently. Good maintenance extends the life of your refrigerator. It prevents many common issues.

First, **stick to a regular replacement schedule.** Jenn Air recommends changing your water filter every six months. If your household uses a lot of water or has poor water quality, you might need to change it more often. The filter indicator light is a helpful reminder. But do not wait for the light if you notice a decline in water quality or flow. I set a calendar reminder to avoid forgetting.

Second, **flush the system thoroughly after every filter change.** I cannot stress this enough. Running several gallons of water through the dispenser clears out air bubbles. It also removes loose carbon particles. This ensures your first glass of water from the new filter is clean and tastes great. It sets up the filter for optimal performance from day one.

Third, **keep the water dispenser and ice maker clean.** Mold and mildew can grow in damp areas. Regularly wipe down the dispenser nozzle. Clean the ice bin. Use a mild soap solution and rinse thoroughly. This prevents contamination of your filtered water and ice. A clean environment supports the filter's work.

Fourth, **inspect the water lines periodically.** Look for any kinks, leaks, or damage. Damaged lines can affect water flow or cause leaks. Addressing these issues early prevents larger problems. While you are at it, consider regular general cleaning of your refrigerator. This includes cleaning under the fridge to remove dust and debris. This helps the appliance run more efficiently.

By following these maintenance tips, you can maximize your Jenn Air refrigerator's performance. You will ensure a continuous supply of fresh, clean, and great-tasting water for your family. This proactive approach saves money on repairs and gives you peace of mind.

A clogged filter also puts extra strain on your refrigerator's water system, potentially leading to reduced efficiency or more significant problems over time.

### Can I use a generic water filter with my Jenn Air refrigerator?
You can use a generic or compatible water filter, but ensure it is specifically designed for Jenn Air models and is certified. Look for certifications like NSF/ANSI standards 42 and 53.
