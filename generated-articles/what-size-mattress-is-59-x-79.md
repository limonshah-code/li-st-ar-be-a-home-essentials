## Unraveling the Mystery: What Size Mattress Is 59 x 79 Inches?

Have you ever found yourself puzzling over mattress dimensions? Perhaps you are measuring an existing bed frame or an RV sleeping area. You might encounter an unusual size, like 59 inches by 79 inches. This specific measurement does not align with typical household mattress standards. So, what size mattress is 59 x 79 inches, and why does it exist?

I understand the confusion these unique sizes cause. Standard mattress names like King or Queen are easy to identify. However, when dimensions like 59x79 appear, they require a closer look. This article will clarify this specific mattress size. We will explore its common names, where you typically find it, and how to find suitable bedding. We will also discuss options if you need a mattress of these exact dimensions. My goal is to help you understand this particular mattress size. You will gain confidence in choosing the right sleep solution.

### Takeaway

*   A 59 x 79 inch mattress is typically known as an RV Queen or Short Queen.
*   It is slightly smaller than a standard Queen mattress.
*   RV Queen mattresses are common in recreational vehicles due to space limitations.
*   Finding bedding may require specific "Short Queen" products or custom options.
*   Measure your space precisely before buying any mattress.

**What size mattress is 59 x 79?** A 59 x 79 inch mattress is commonly known as an RV Queen or Short Queen. This size is specifically designed to fit into recreational vehicles (RVs) and some older or custom bed frames. It is one inch narrower and one inch shorter than a standard Queen mattress.

## Identifying the 59 x 79 Mattress Size: A Deeper Look

When you measure a mattress at 59 inches by 79 inches, you are looking at a non-standard size in the context of typical home bedrooms. Standard mattresses in the United States follow specific dimensions. For example, a standard Queen mattress measures 60 inches wide by 80 inches long. A full-size mattress is 54 inches wide by 75 inches long. The 59x79 dimensions fall between these common sizes. They indicate a specialized use.

This particular mattress size has earned a few common names. Most often, people refer to it as an RV Queen or a Short Queen. The "RV" in RV Queen directly points to its primary use: recreational vehicles. RVs have strict space constraints, making every inch count. A standard Queen mattress would simply be too large for many RV sleeping areas. Therefore, manufacturers created this slightly smaller version. This allows RV owners to enjoy near-Queen-sized comfort in a limited footprint. The "Short Queen" name highlights its slightly reduced length compared to a standard Queen. This size perfectly maximizes sleeping space in mobile living environments.

### RV Queen vs. Standard Queen Dimensions

Let us break down the differences between these two sizes. A standard Queen mattress measures 60 inches wide and 80 inches long. This offers ample space for two adults. The RV Queen, at 59 inches wide and 79 inches long, is just slightly smaller. It provides 1 inch less width and 1 inch less length. These seemingly small differences are crucial in tight spaces. That one inch can make a bed fit perfectly into a pre-defined RV alcove. It ensures proper clearance for walking or closing doors. You can see how precision matters in these situations.

### Where You Might Find a 59 x 79 Mattress

You will most likely encounter a 59 x 79 mattress in an RV or travel trailer. Many motorhomes, fifth wheels, and campers come equipped with this specific mattress size from the factory. Their interiors are designed around these precise dimensions. This ensures optimal use of limited square footage. However, RVs are not the only place you might find such a mattress. Some older bed frames, particularly antique or European models, may also have slightly different dimensions. This could lead to a need for a custom-sized mattress. Even some modern platform beds or custom-built sleeping nooks might perfectly fit a 59x79 mattress. Knowing the exact dimensions helps you identify what you have. It also guides you in finding the right replacement or bedding.

## The RV Queen Mattress: Perfectly Sized for Mobile Living

The RV Queen mattress, specifically the 59 x 79 inch size, is a cornerstone of comfortable travel for many. This mattress is a prime example of how design adapts to environmental constraints. Recreational vehicles prioritize every square inch of space. They must accommodate living areas, kitchens, bathrooms, and sleeping quarters. Standard residential mattresses often do not fit these confined spaces. That is why the RV Queen became a necessary and popular solution. It offers a balance between sleeping comfort and efficient use of the vehicle's interior.

Imagine trying to maneuver a full 60x80 inch Queen mattress into a narrow RV doorway or around tight corners. Even moving a larger mattress in a house can be challenging, as some know from trying to get a king size mattress upstairs. The slightly smaller dimensions of the RV Queen make it much easier to install and replace within an RV. This thoughtful design helps RV manufacturers maximize sleeping areas without sacrificing too much living space.

The benefits of a slightly smaller queen are clear for mobile living. Firstly, it allows for more walking room around the bed. This is essential in a compact RV interior. Secondly, it ensures that overhead cabinets or built-in storage units can still be easily accessed. These are often located directly above or beside the sleeping area. Thirdly, it can allow for other amenities, such as a small wardrobe or a deeper bedside table. These would not fit if the bed was a standard Queen size. This specific sizing truly optimizes the functionality of the RV bedroom.

For RV owners, recognizing that your mattress is a 59 x 79 RV Queen is vital. This knowledge guides your decisions when replacing an old mattress. It also helps when you are looking for new bedding. You cannot simply grab standard Queen sheets from any store and expect a perfect fit. Understanding this distinction saves time and frustration. It ensures you buy products that truly match your unique mobile bedroom setup. The RV Queen allows travelers to enjoy restful nights on the road. It provides comfort without compromising the precious space within their home on wheels.

## Understanding Non-Standard Mattress Sizes and Their Origins

Finding a 59 x 79 inch mattress highlights the world of non-standard mattress sizes. Most people are familiar with Twin, Full, Queen, and King. However, many beds exist outside these common categories. These unique dimensions arise from various factors. They include specific furniture designs, historical influences, or the need for custom solutions. For instance, antique bed frames often predate modern mattress standardization. Their unique dimensions sometimes require a mattress that does not fit current norms. European bed sizes also differ from American ones. This means an imported bed frame might need a specific mattress size like the 59x79, which is close to a European Queen.

The need for such precise measurements is critical. A mattress that is even an inch too wide or too long may not fit properly into a fixed bed frame. This is especially true for built-in beds in RVs or custom-made furniture. Manufacturers sometimes produce these odd sizes to meet niche demands. They cater to customers with specific furniture needs. They also address space limitations, as seen with RVs. This specialization ensures every bed, regardless of its unique shape or size, can have a perfectly fitted mattress.

For those with highly specific needs, creating a mattress from scratch is an option. If you are handy, you can learn how to make my own mattress to fit truly unusual dimensions. This provides a precise solution when off-the-shelf options are not available. Custom mattress makers also specialize in these unique sizes. They can build a mattress to your exact specifications. This ensures a perfect fit for any non-standard bed frame. Such custom solutions ensure that even the most unique sleeping spaces can be comfortable and functional.

Ultimately, non-standard mattress sizes demonstrate the diversity in bedding needs. They cater to specific historical contexts, design choices, and practical limitations. Understanding their origins helps you appreciate why these specific dimensions exist. It empowers you to find the right solution for your unique sleeping setup. Always measure your space accurately. This ensures you get a mattress that fits perfectly, providing comfort and stability.

## Finding Bedding and Accessories for Your 59 x 79 Mattress

Once you confirm your mattress is a 59 x 79 RV Queen, the next challenge is finding suitable bedding. This specific size can make shopping for sheets, mattress protectors, and toppers tricky. Standard Queen bedding (60x80 inches) will be slightly too large. Full-size bedding (54x75 inches) will be too small. This means you cannot simply pick up any "Queen" sheet set from a department store and expect a perfect fit. The extra inch of width and length in standard Queen sheets will cause them to bunch up. They will not provide a taut, smooth sleeping surface.

Your primary option for a perfect fit is to look for bedding specifically labeled "Short Queen" or "RV Queen." Many online retailers and specialty RV supply stores carry these items. They are designed to precisely fit the 59 x 79 inch dimensions. This ensures a snug fit for your fitted sheet. It also means your flat sheet and duvet cover will drape appropriately without excessive overhang or bunching. Always double-check the listed dimensions on product descriptions before buying. Some "RV Queen" sizes might vary slightly by manufacturer.

If finding dedicated "Short Queen" bedding is difficult, you have a few alternatives. One option is to use standard Queen-size bedding and tuck it more tightly. The extra fabric can be tucked under the mattress. However, this may not result in the neatest appearance or the most secure fit. It can lead to the fitted sheet coming loose more easily. Another solution is to consider custom-made bedding. Several online companies specialize in creating sheets and mattress protectors for unusual mattress sizes. This option offers a perfect fit but typically comes at a higher cost.

When it comes to mattress pads and toppers, the same sizing challenges apply. Look for "Short Queen" or "RV Queen" specific options. If none are available, a standard Queen topper might work. You can carefully trim it to size, especially if it is a foam topper. However, this is not always ideal for all materials. Ensure any bedding you choose can be properly cared for. For larger items, you might even consider [what size washing machine for king size bedding](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-size-washing-machine-for-king-size-bedding) to ensure your machine can handle the bulk, though a Short Queen would be much smaller. Investing in the right bedding enhances your comfort. It also protects your mattress, extending its life.

## Is a 59 x 79 Mattress Right for Your Space? Pros and Cons

Deciding if a 59 x 79 inch mattress is the correct choice for your needs involves weighing its advantages and disadvantages. This size is not for everyone. Its suitability largely depends on your specific space and priorities. Understanding its pros and cons helps you make an informed decision.

### Pros of a 59 x 79 Mattress:

*   **Optimal for RVs and Campers:** This is where the 59 x 79 RV Queen truly shines. It is designed to fit snugly into the often-compact sleeping areas of recreational vehicles. It maximizes the available bed space without blocking walkways or access to cabinets. This size allows RV owners to enjoy a near-Queen-sized sleeping surface on the go.
*   **Ideal for Specific Bed Frames:** If you own an antique bed frame, a custom-built platform, or a unique imported bed, a 59 x 79 mattress might be the perfect fit. Standard sizes often do not work for these specialized frames. A custom or RV Queen size ensures a secure and stable sleeping surface. It prevents gaps or overhangs that can compromise comfort and safety.
*   **Space-Saving in Small Rooms:** For a very small bedroom where a standard Queen would overwhelm the space, a 59x79 mattress offers a slight reduction in footprint. While only an inch smaller in each dimension, this can sometimes make a difference in tight layouts. It allows for better room flow or the addition of a small bedside table.
*   **Comfort for One or Two:** Despite being slightly smaller than a standard Queen, the 59x79 size still provides comfortable sleeping space for one person. It can also accommodate two average-sized adults reasonably well. It gives more room than a Full size mattress. This makes it a good compromise for couples in limited spaces.

### Cons of a 59 x 79 Mattress:

*   **Limited Accessory Availability:** This is perhaps the biggest drawback. Finding sheets, mattress protectors, and mattress toppers specifically for a 59 x 79 inch mattress can be challenging. Most brick-and-mortar stores do not stock "Short Queen" items. You will likely need to order online from specialty RV suppliers or custom bedding manufacturers. This can limit your choices in terms of color, material, and price.
*   **Higher Cost for Custom Items:** If you cannot find pre-made "Short Queen" accessories, you might need to order custom-sized bedding. Custom items typically cost more than standard-sized products. This adds to the overall expense of owning this particular mattress size.
*   **Fewer Mattress Options:** While RV mattress manufacturers offer this size, your selection of brands, materials (e.g., memory foam, innerspring, hybrid), and firmness levels might be narrower compared to standard Queen mattresses. This can make it harder to find your ideal sleep surface.
*   **Resale Value and Future Upgrades:** If you ever decide to replace your bed frame or move to a home without an RV, this mattress size might not be easily reusable. Its specific dimensions mean it will not fit a standard Queen frame. This could make resale difficult or require a new mattress purchase.

In conclusion, a 59 x 79 mattress is an excellent solution for specific situations like RVs or unique bed frames. However, be prepared for the potential challenges in finding accessories and limited mattress options. Measure your space carefully, consider your long-term needs, and factor in the availability of bedding before committing to this size.

## Caring for Your Unique Mattress: Maintenance Tips

Regardless of its unique size, proper mattress care is crucial for longevity and hygiene. A 59 x 79 mattress, like any other, benefits greatly from regular maintenance. These simple steps ensure your sleeping surface remains comfortable and clean for years. They also help to prevent common issues like sagging or odors.

First, invest in a good quality mattress protector. This acts as a barrier against spills, stains, dust mites, and allergens. For your 59 x 79 mattress, you will need a "Short Queen" or "RV Queen" specific protector. A protector is much easier to clean than the mattress itself. It prolongs the life of your mattress significantly. You can learn more about how to clean stains from a mattress if accidents do happen.

Regular cleaning is also essential. Vacuuming your mattress every few months helps remove dust, dead skin cells, and other debris. Use the upholstery attachment on your vacuum cleaner. Pay special attention to seams and crevices. For deeper cleaning or refreshing, you might consider how to deep clean your mattress periodically. This can involve spot treating stains or using a mattress deodorizer.

Ventilation is another key aspect of mattress care. Mattresses can trap moisture, which can lead to mold or mildew growth. Whenever possible, air out your mattress. This means removing all bedding and allowing the mattress to breathe for a few hours. If your mattress is in an RV, opening windows and vents can help. If you notice an unusual smell, understanding why does my mattress smell can help you address the root cause.

Rotating your mattress is also beneficial. While some smaller RV mattresses might not allow for full rotation, if your 59 x 79 mattress is symmetrical, rotate it head-to-toe every three to six months. This helps distribute wear evenly across the surface. It prevents premature sagging in specific areas. If your mattress is one-sided, simply rotate it. If it is two-sided, you can flip it. Always check the manufacturer's recommendations for rotating or flipping.

Finally, avoid eating or drinking in bed to prevent spills and crumbs. If you do spill something, clean it immediately. Dab the area with a clean cloth and a mild cleaning solution. Do not saturate the mattress. By following these care tips, you will ensure your 59 x 79 mattress provides a healthy and comfortable sleep environment for many years.

## The Process of Ordering a Custom-Sized Mattress

Sometimes, even the "Short Queen" or RV Queen size at 59 x 79 inches is not quite right, or perhaps you have an even more unusual bed frame. In such cases, ordering a custom-sized mattress becomes a viable and often necessary solution. This process ensures a perfect fit for any unique sleeping space. It provides comfort where standard sizes simply do not work.

The first and most critical step is precise measurement. You must accurately measure the inside dimensions of your bed frame or the platform where the mattress will sit. Use a metal tape measure for the best accuracy. Measure both the width and the length at multiple points. Do this from inside edge to inside edge. Take down the smallest measurement for both dimensions. This prevents buying a mattress that is too large to fit. Also, consider the desired thickness or height of the mattress. Some frames have specific depth requirements.

Next, research manufacturers that specialize in custom mattresses. Many online companies and some local mattress stores offer this service. Look for companies with good reviews and experience in making non-standard sizes. Contact them with your exact measurements. Discuss the type of mattress you want. Most custom manufacturers offer various materials. These include innerspring, memory foam, latex, or hybrid options. They can also often create different firmness levels.

When speaking with a custom mattress maker, clarify all specifications. Ask about the materials used, the warranty, and the estimated production time. Understand the pricing structure. Custom mattresses typically cost more than standard sizes due to the specialized manufacturing process. Inquire about delivery options and any potential additional fees for shipping larger or unusually shaped items. Some companies might even offer guidance on how to make my own mattress if you are considering a DIY approach for a truly unique situation. However, for most, professional custom building is the best path.

The wait time for a custom mattress can vary, often ranging from a few weeks to a couple of months. Once your custom 59 x 79 mattress arrives, inspect it carefully. Ensure it matches your specified dimensions and quality expectations. A custom mattress is an investment in personalized comfort. It guarantees your unique bed frame finally has a perfectly fitting and comfortable sleeping surface. This tailored approach provides the best solution for any non-standard bedding need.

## FAQ Section

A "Short Queen" mattress is another name for a mattress that is typically 60 inches wide by 75 inches long, or sometimes 59 x 79 inches, specifically designed for recreational vehicles (RVs).

### Are 59x79 mattresses comfortable?

Yes, 59x79 mattresses can be very comfortable. Their comfort level depends on the materials and construction, just like any other mattress.
