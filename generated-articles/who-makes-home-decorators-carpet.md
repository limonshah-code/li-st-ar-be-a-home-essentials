### Who Makes Home Decorators Carpet? The Concise Answer

Home Decorators Carpet is a private label brand exclusively sold by Home Depot. Major, established carpet manufacturers produce these carpets. The primary manufacturers contributing to the Home Decorators Collection are Mohawk Industries and Shaw Industries. These companies manufacture the carpet lines under Home Depot's specifications, allowing Home Depot to offer a wide range of styles and qualities to its customers.

### The Mystery Behind Home Decorators Carpet: A Private Label Revealed

When you shop for carpet, you often see brand names like Shaw or Mohawk. However, Home Decorators Collection stands out as a unique label. This is because Home Decorators Collection is Home Depot's own private brand. Many large retailers use private labels to offer exclusive products. These products are often competitive in price and style.

The actual manufacturing of these carpets is outsourced to well-known, established carpet mills. Home Depot sets the specifications for design, quality, and materials. Then, these manufacturers produce the carpet according to those requirements. This approach benefits Home Depot by allowing them to control branding and pricing. It also benefits customers by providing unique options that are not available elsewhere. Understanding this relationship helps you appreciate the true origins of your Home Decorators Carpet.

This model is not uncommon in the retail world. It allows a retailer to offer a diverse product range without owning the manufacturing facilities. For you, the customer, it means you get a product designed for the Home Depot market. These carpets aim to balance style, durability, and affordability. They often incorporate features that resonate with a wide range of homeowners.

### Unveiling the Key Manufacturers: Mohawk Industries' Contribution

Mohawk Industries stands as one of the largest flooring manufacturers in the world. It is no surprise that they play a significant role in producing Home Decorators Carpet. Mohawk has a long history of making various flooring products, including broadloom carpet. They are known for their innovation in fiber technology and carpet construction. When you see a Home Decorators Collection carpet, there is a good chance it came from a Mohawk factory.

Mohawk brings its extensive expertise to the Home Decorators Collection. This includes using advanced stain and soil protection treatments. They also contribute to the durability of the carpets through their fiber engineering. Many of Mohawk's proprietary technologies might be integrated into these private label lines. This ensures a certain level of quality and performance for the customer.

I have personally seen many carpets from Home Depot that exhibit characteristics similar to Mohawk's main lines. This often includes specific yarn types or backing systems. Mohawk's involvement provides assurance of quality for the Home Decorators Collection. They are a reputable company with a strong commitment to carpet manufacturing. Their production scales allow Home Depot to offer competitive prices. This collaboration helps bring a wide array of carpet options to your local store.

### Shaw Industries: A Major Contributor to Home Decorators' Success

Another giant in the flooring industry, Shaw Industries, is also a primary manufacturer for Home Decorators Carpet. Shaw is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway and is known for its vast array of carpet styles and innovative products. Like Mohawk, Shaw has a strong reputation for producing high-quality and durable carpets. Their participation is crucial in making Home Decorators Collection a comprehensive brand.

Shaw's manufacturing capabilities are extensive. They produce carpet for both residential and commercial applications. This vast experience translates into the Home Decorators Collection. You might find carpets with Shaw's advanced stain protection systems or unique fiber blends. Their commitment to sustainability is also a factor, with many Shaw carpets incorporating recycled materials. These practices often extend to the products they make for private labels.

I often compare Shaw and Mohawk carpets when helping friends choose flooring. Both companies offer excellent products. Shaw's strength lies in its diverse styling and focus on consumer needs. Their involvement with Home Decorators Collection ensures a broad selection. This includes various pile heights, textures, and color palettes. Home Depot benefits from Shaw's manufacturing prowess. This partnership provides consumers with reliable and attractive carpet choices. Shaw's strong distribution network also helps ensure availability in Home Depot stores nationwide.

### Other Potential Makers: Beyond the Giants

While Mohawk and Shaw are the biggest players, other manufacturers might contribute to the Home Decorators Collection. The carpet industry is vast, and many reputable mills operate. Sometimes, Home Depot might work with smaller or specialized manufacturers for specific product lines. This helps them diversify their offerings even further. These smaller collaborations allow for unique textures or specialized performance features.

One such potential contributor could be Beaulieu of America. They are another large North American carpet manufacturer. Beaulieu produces a wide range of residential and commercial carpets. They are known for their focus on value and style. Their product lines often feature innovative fibers and durable construction. It is plausible that some Home Decorators Carpet lines originate from Beaulieu facilities.

Phenix Flooring is another company that has grown significantly in recent years. They are known for stylish and affordable carpet options. Engineered Floors, a relatively newer but rapidly expanding company, also produces a large volume of carpet. These companies possess the manufacturing capacity and expertise to produce private label carpets. Home Depot might leverage these manufacturers to fill specific niches within the Home Decorators Collection. This strategy ensures a diverse selection for customers. It also allows Home Depot to offer carpets across various price points and quality levels.

### Understanding Home Decorators Carpet Quality and Features

When you buy Home Decorators Carpet, you are investing in specific features and quality levels. Since major manufacturers produce these carpets, you can expect certain standards. The quality often depends on the fiber type, carpet construction, and any applied treatments. It is important to look at these details to understand what you are getting.

**Fiber Types:**
*   **Polyester (PET):** Many Home Decorators carpets use polyester fibers. Polyester is known for its softness and resistance to stains. It holds color well and is often made from recycled materials. However, it can be less resilient to crushing than nylon.
*   **Nylon:** Nylon is a highly durable and resilient fiber. It handles heavy foot traffic well and resists crushing. Nylon carpets often come with good stain protection. They tend to be more expensive than polyester but offer superior longevity.
*   **Triexta (PTT):** This fiber combines some benefits of both nylon and polyester. It offers excellent stain resistance and good durability. Brands like SmartStrand (Mohawk) often use Triexta. Some Home Decorators lines might feature similar fibers.

**Carpet Construction:**
*   **Pile Height and Density:** Denser carpets with shorter piles generally wear better. They resist crushing and matting more effectively. Looser, taller piles can feel luxurious but might show traffic patterns sooner.
*   **Twist Level:** A higher twist level in the yarn means the carpet fibers are more tightly wound. This increases durability and helps the carpet resist unraveling.
*   **Backing:** The carpet backing provides stability and strength. Better backings resist stretching and buckling. A good backing extends the life of the carpet. A strong backing helps prevent issues like [what makes a carpet buckle](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-makes-a-carpet-buckle). Also, a proper backing helps prevent carpet bubbling up over time. [What makes carpet bubble up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-makes-carpet-bubble-up) is often related to inadequate installation or backing.

**Treatments:**
Many Home Decorators carpets come with stain-resistant treatments. These treatments help repel liquids and make spills easier to clean. They also often include soil protection to prevent dirt from adhering to the fibers. These features enhance the carpet's longevity and ease of maintenance.

### Choosing Your Home Decorators Carpet: Styles and Aesthetics

The Home Decorators Collection offers a vast array of styles and aesthetics. This allows you to find carpet that matches your home's decor and your personal taste. When choosing, consider the visual impact and how the carpet will function in your specific room. Different styles offer varied textures and looks.

**Common Carpet Styles:**
*   **Plush (Velvet):** This style has a smooth, uniform surface. The fibers are cut to the same height. It creates a formal and luxurious look. However, it can show footprints and vacuum marks easily.
*   **Frieze (Twist):** Frieze carpet has long, twisted fibers that curl at the ends. It creates a textured, informal look. Frieze is very durable and hides footprints and dirt well. It is a good choice for high-traffic areas.
*   **Saxony:** Similar to plush, but with a slightly less uniform surface. The fibers are cut and twisted. It offers a soft, elegant look. Saxony carpets can also show footprints.
*   **Textured:** This style uses fibers cut at different heights. It creates a multi-tonal, varied surface. Textured carpets are very popular due to their ability to hide traffic patterns and their casual appearance.
*   **Loop Pile (Berber):** Loop pile carpet has uncut loops. Berber is a common type, featuring large, chunky loops. It is very durable and resistant to crushing. Berber is excellent for high-traffic areas and basements. It offers a more natural, informal look.

**Color and Pattern:**
Color plays a huge role in the feel of a room. Light colors make rooms feel larger and brighter. Darker colors add warmth and sophistication. They also tend to hide stains better. Home Decorators Collection offers a wide palette of colors. You can find neutrals, bold hues, and patterned options. Patterns can add visual interest. They can also help disguise dirt and wear in busy households. Always bring samples home. See how the color looks in your room's natural and artificial light before making a final choice.

### Installation and Maintenance of Your Home Decorators Carpet

Once you select your Home Decorators Carpet, proper installation and ongoing maintenance are crucial. These steps ensure your carpet looks good and lasts a long time. Home Depot often offers installation services. Using their professional installers can save you time and effort. Professional installation also ensures the warranty remains valid.

**Professional Installation Benefits:**
*   **Expertise:** Installers have the tools and skills to correctly stretch and secure the carpet. This prevents issues like buckling or wrinkles.
*   **Warranty:** Many carpet warranties require professional installation.
*   **Efficiency:** Professionals complete the job quickly and effectively.
*   **Preparation:** They will correctly prepare your subfloor. This step is important for a smooth and even finish.
*   Sometimes you may need to [replace all the carpet in my home](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-all-the-carpet-in-my-home). This is a big job. Professional help makes it much easier.

**Carpet Maintenance Tips:**
Regular cleaning is key to keeping your carpet looking fresh. I always recommend vacuuming frequently, especially in high-traffic areas. This removes loose dirt before it gets embedded in the fibers. For spills, act quickly. Blot the spill with a clean cloth, do not rub. Many Home Decorators carpets have stain-resistant treatments, but prompt action is still important.

For deeper cleaning, consider professional carpet cleaning every 12-18 months. You can also [clean carpet at home](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-carpet-at-home) yourself using a carpet cleaner machine. These machines can be rented or purchased. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for any cleaning products. If you are unsure how to clean carpet at home, many guides can help.
