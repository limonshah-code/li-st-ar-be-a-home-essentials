Size is the most important factor. A rug too small makes a room feel disconnected. A rug too large can overwhelm the space. Measure your room carefully. Decide how much furniture you want on the rug.

Think about the room's traffic. High-traffic areas need durable, easy-to-clean materials. Low-traffic areas can handle more delicate rugs. Choose a material that suits your lifestyle and household needs.
