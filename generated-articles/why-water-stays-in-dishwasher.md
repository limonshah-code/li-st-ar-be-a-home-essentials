## Why Water Stays In Your Dishwasher: Common Causes and Solutions

Finding standing water at the bottom of your dishwasher after a cycle is a frustrating sight. It often means your dishes are not clean, and you cannot load new ones. This common problem affects many homeowners. You want your appliance to work correctly and drain all water.

This issue stops your dishwasher from completing its main job. You might wonder why water stays in the dishwasher, or if you need to call a repair person. Many reasons cause this problem, from simple clogs to mechanical failures. I will explore the main reasons water collects in your dishwasher. We will also cover how you can troubleshoot and fix these issues yourself. Understanding the cause helps you solve the problem fast.

### Takeaway

*   **Check the Filter:** A clogged filter is the most common reason for standing water.
*   **Inspect the Drain Hose:** Kinks or blockages in the drain hose prevent proper drainage.
*   **Clear the Air Gap:** If present, a clogged air gap can stop water from draining.
*   **Examine the Drain Pump:** A faulty drain pump or blockages within it will cause water to remain.
*   **Test the Drain Valve:** An obstructed or broken drain valve keeps water in the tub.

**Why water stays in a dishwasher:** Water stays in your dishwasher when the drainage system fails. This often happens due to a clogged filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, a malfunctioning drain pump, or an obstructed air gap. These issues prevent water from exiting the appliance properly after a wash cycle.

### Clogged Dishwasher Filter: A Primary Cause

One of the most frequent reasons for standing water in your dishwasher is a clogged filter. Over time, food particles, grease, and debris accumulate in the filter. This buildup blocks water from reaching the drain pump. When the filter is blocked, water cannot flow out freely.

Dishwasher filters sit at the bottom of the tub. They catch large food scraps to prevent them from entering the drain system. If you do not clean your filter regularly, it becomes completely blocked. This blockage makes it impossible for the water to drain. Cleaning the filter is a simple first step in troubleshooting standing water.

I usually check my filter first when I see water. It is amazing how much gunk can gather there. A dirty filter makes the dishwasher less efficient too. This includes not only draining but also cleaning dishes effectively. Maintaining a clean filter is crucial for the overall performance of your appliance. Regularly inspect this component.

*   **Locating the Filter:** Most dishwashers have a filter assembly at the bottom of the wash tub. It is usually a cylindrical or flat screen you can twist or lift out.
*   **Cleaning Process:** Remove the filter according to your dishwasher's manual. Rinse it under running water to remove all debris. You might need a brush for stubborn particles.
*   **Frequency:** I recommend cleaning your dishwasher filter at least once a month. If you wash many heavily soiled dishes, clean it more often.

If you suspect your filter is the culprit, you can often see visible debris on its surface. For more specific issues related to filter clogs, you might find more help on why your [dishwasher filter is full of water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-dishwasher-filter-full-of-water). This general maintenance step often solves the problem.

### Inspecting the Dishwasher Drain Hose

After checking the filter, your next step should be the drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. If this hose has a kink or a blockage, water cannot flow out. A kink often occurs during installation or if the dishwasher shifts.

Blockages in the drain hose are also common. Food debris, grease, or even small objects can get stuck inside. These obstructions prevent the water from draining properly. You might see standing water even if the pump sounds like it is running. The water has nowhere to go.

I once found a toy car stuck in my drain hose; my kids were surprised. Always ensure the hose runs smoothly without sharp bends. The hose should also have a high loop to prevent dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. This high loop is a standard installation requirement.

*   **Checking for Kinks:** Pull the dishwasher out slightly if possible. Look behind it for any sharp bends or crimps in the hose. Straighten any kinks you find.
*   **Clearing Blockages:** Disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink/disposal connection. You may need a bucket to catch any water. Use a thin brush or a straightened coat hanger to clear any obstructions inside the hose.
*   **High Loop:** Ensure the drain hose has a high loop. This loop should be above the dishwasher's drain connection. This prevents backflow from your sink drain into the dishwasher.

A clear and correctly installed drain hose is essential for proper drainage. A blocked drain hose can cause water to stay in various brands of dishwashers. For example, some people ask [why their LG dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom). The drain hose is a common cause for this issue across all brands.

### Issues with the Dishwasher Drain Pump

The drain pump is a vital component for removing water from your dishwasher. It actively pushes water out through the drain hose. If the drain pump malfunctions or is obstructed, water will stay in the bottom of your dishwasher. A pump can fail due to electrical issues or mechanical problems.

Sometimes, small items like broken glass, fruit pits, or even a piece of cutlery can get past the filter and jam the pump impeller. The impeller is the part of the pump that spins to push water. If it cannot spin freely, the pump cannot do its job. You might hear a humming sound, but no water drains. This means the motor is running, but the impeller is stuck.

I have found coins stuck in drain pumps before. It is always a good idea to check for foreign objects. If the pump sounds like it is struggling or not making any sound at all, it might be faulty.

*   **Listen to the Pump:** During the drain cycle, listen for the pump. A healthy pump makes a distinct whirring sound. A humming sound without water draining suggests a blockage. No sound at all might mean a power issue or a completely failed pump.
*   **Check for Obstructions:** Disconnect power to the dishwasher. Access the drain pump, usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher near the filter. Carefully remove any visible debris or objects jamming the impeller.
*   **Test the Pump:** If no obstructions are found, the pump itself might be faulty. This often requires professional diagnosis or replacement. Some dishwashers, like [Whirlpool dishwashers, can have water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-whirlpool-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) due to pump issues.

If you suspect a faulty drain pump, it is often a more complex repair. You might need to consult a technician. However, checking for blockages is a good DIY step first.

### Understanding Dishwasher Air Gaps and Blockages

Some dishwashers have an air gap installed on the countertop, usually near the faucet. The air gap prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It is a safety feature, but it can also become a point of blockage. Food debris or grease can build up inside the air gap.

If the air gap is clogged, water cannot drain from the dishwasher effectively. The water backs up into the dishwasher tub. You might see water bubbling out of the air gap cover on your countertop. This is a clear sign of a blockage within the air gap itself.

I have seen many air gaps overflow onto the counter. It is a messy but clear indicator. Cleaning the air gap is usually a simple task. It is a good idea to check this component if you have one.

*   **Identify the Air Gap:** Look for a small, cylindrical cap on your countertop, usually 2-3 inches tall, often near the sink.
*   **Clean the Air Gap:** Remove the cap. You will see a small, inner cap or housing. Remove this and clear any debris with a brush or a paper towel. Ensure both hoses connected to the air gap are clear as well.
*   **Test Drainage:** After cleaning, run a quick cycle to see if the water drains properly.

If your dishwasher uses an air gap, it is a common point for clogs. Addressing this can quickly resolve the standing water issue.

### Issues with the Drain Valve or Check Valve

Some dishwasher models have a drain valve that opens to allow water out during the drain cycle. This valve ensures water only flows one way and does not back up into the tub. If this valve gets stuck in a closed position or is obstructed, water will remain in the dishwasher. This is less common in newer dishwashers, as many rely solely on the pump and high loop for one-way flow.

Similarly, a check valve, sometimes integrated into the drain pump or hose, performs a similar function. It prevents water from returning to the tub after it has been pumped out. If the check valve fails or becomes clogged, water can seep back in. You might notice the water level slowly rising after a cycle finishes.

I once encountered a stubborn piece of plastic stuck in a drain valve. It was just enough to prevent a full opening. These small parts can cause big drainage problems.

*   **Locating the Valve:** The drain valve is usually near the drain pump. Consult your dishwasher's service manual for its exact location.
*   **Checking for Obstructions:** With power disconnected, inspect the valve for any debris that might prevent it from opening or closing fully. Clear any obstructions carefully.
*   **Testing the Valve:** If the valve appears clear but still causes issues, it might be faulty. A malfunctioning valve might need replacement, which often requires a technician.

Understanding these less common but possible causes helps in a complete diagnosis. For specific models, like a [Bosch dishwasher with water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-bosch-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom), these internal components can be the root cause.

### Garbage Disposal Connection or Clog

If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, an issue with the disposal itself can prevent proper drainage. A common mistake during installation is forgetting to remove the knockout plug in the disposal's dishwasher inlet. If this plug is not removed, water from the dishwasher cannot enter the disposal. It will back up into the dishwasher tub.

Even if the plug was removed, a clogged garbage disposal can also cause drainage problems. Food waste, especially starchy or greasy items, can block the disposal's drain line. This backup prevents the dishwasher from emptying its water into the disposal. You might notice your sink draining slowly as well.

I always tell people to check the knockout plug first if their dishwasher is new or newly installed. It is a small detail that causes big problems. Running your garbage disposal regularly helps prevent clogs.

*   **Check the Knockout Plug:** If your dishwasher is new and connecting to a garbage disposal for the first time, ensure the knockout plug inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet has been removed. This usually requires a hammer and screwdriver.
*   **Run the Disposal:** Make sure your garbage disposal is clear. Run it with plenty of cold water for about 30 seconds before and after using the dishwasher. This clears any food debris.
*   **Clear Disposal Clogs:** If the disposal itself is clogged, clear it using standard methods like plunging or disassembling the P-trap. If your [KitchenAid dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-kitchenaid-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom), the garbage disposal connection is a frequent, often overlooked, cause.

Ensuring your garbage disposal is clear and properly set up is a quick fix for many drainage issues.

### Other Potential Issues and Professional Help

While filter clogs, drain hose issues, pump failures, and air gap blockages are the most common reasons water stays in your dishwasher, other less frequent problems can occur. These might include issues with the main drain line of your home, electrical problems affecting the pump, or even a faulty control board.

If you have checked all the common culprits and water still remains, the problem might be more complex. Sometimes, the main plumbing in your house could be the issue. If your sink drains slowly or other drains are backed up, your home's main drain line might need attention. This is outside the dishwasher's direct system.

At this point, you may need professional help. Appliance repair technicians have specialized tools and knowledge to diagnose and fix these trickier problems. They can test electrical components, check control boards, and perform repairs that require specific expertise. I usually recommend calling a pro if you've exhausted all DIY options.

*   **Main Drain Line Clog:** If multiple drains in your home are slow or backed up, the main household drain line might be clogged. This requires a plumber, not an appliance technician.
*   **Electrical Problems:** A loose wire or a faulty control board might prevent the drain pump from getting power. This requires electrical testing, which can be dangerous without proper knowledge.
*   **Sump Assembly Issues:** Some dishwashers have a sump assembly at the bottom that can get clogged or damaged. This requires more involved disassembly.
*   **When to Call a Pro:** If you have tried all troubleshooting steps, and the water still stays, it is time to call a qualified appliance repair technician. They can diagnose internal component failures and perform complex repairs safely. You can also review how to [drain water from your dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-out-water-from-dishwasher) manually while you wait for a technician.

Don't hesitate to seek professional assistance if you are unsure or uncomfortable performing complex repairs. It protects both you and your appliance.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why is there dirty water in the bottom of my dishwasher?
Dirty water in your dishwasher's bottom means the drainage system is completely blocked or malfunctioning. This can be due to a severely clogged filter, a kinked or blocked drain hose, or a non-functional drain pump. The dirty water is usually the last wash cycle's water that failed to drain out properly.

#### How do I force my dishwasher to drain?
To force your dishwasher to drain, first turn off the power. Remove any visible standing water manually with a cup or towel. Then, check and clear the filter, drain hose, and air gap for obstructions. Running a short rinse cycle after clearing may help test the drainage.

#### Is a small amount of water at the bottom of the dishwasher normal?
A very small amount of residual water, typically less than an inch, can be normal in some dishwasher models. This water often sits in the sump area below the filter and prevents the pump seals from drying out. However, standing water covering the entire bottom or rising above the filter is not normal.

#### Can a clogged kitchen sink cause dishwasher not to drain?
Yes, a clogged kitchen sink can absolutely cause your dishwasher not to drain. If your dishwasher drains into your sink's drain or garbage disposal, a clog in the sink's plumbing or the disposal itself will prevent the dishwasher water from exiting. The water will back up into the dishwasher.

#### How much does it cost to fix a dishwasher that won't drain?
The cost to fix a dishwasher that won't drain varies widely. Simple fixes like clearing a filter or drain hose might cost nothing if you do it yourself. If a part needs replacement, like a drain pump, costs can range from $150 to $300 or more, including parts and labor. It depends on the part and technician rates.

#### How often should I clean my dishwasher filter?
You should clean your dishwasher filter at least once a month. If you wash dishes with heavy food debris often, or if you do not pre-rinse dishes, you might need to clean it more frequently, perhaps every two weeks. Regular cleaning prevents clogs and ensures efficient operation.
