These factors include the type of microwave, its size, the power it uses, and special features it offers. Samsung makes models for all kinds of budgets and needs. You can find a simple, affordable microwave or a high-tech one.

Basic countertop models are the most budget-friendly. They offer essential heating and defrosting functions. As you add more features, the price goes up. For example, a larger capacity or higher wattage will increase the cost. If you want a microwave that also bakes or connects to your phone, expect to pay more. These advanced features provide more convenience and cooking options. This makes them a greater investment.

## Types of Samsung Microwaves and Their Costs

Samsung makes several types of microwave ovens. Each type fits a different kitchen setup and comes with a different price. Knowing the types helps you understand the cost. I will explain the most common options below.

### Countertop Samsung Microwave Ovens

Countertop models are the most popular choice. They sit directly on your kitchen counter. These are often the most affordable Samsung microwave ovens. Their price usually ranges from $100 to $250. This depends on their size and power. They are easy to set up. You just plug them in.

They are great for simple tasks like reheating leftovers or popping popcorn. Some basic models might offer quick-start buttons. Higher-end countertop models can have sensor cooking. Sensor cooking adjusts the time based on how much steam the food creates. This ensures your food cooks perfectly without guesswork.

### Over-the-Range (OTR) Samsung Microwave Ovens

Over-the-range microwaves install above your stove. They save counter space. These models also include a built-in ventilation system. This system helps remove smoke and odors from your cooking. OTR Samsung microwave ovens typically cost more than countertop models. Their price range is usually between $250 and $450.

The installation for OTR models is more complex. You might need professional help for this. They are a good choice if you have limited counter space. They also work well if you want a cleaner look in your kitchen. Many OTR models have multiple fan speeds and bright cooktop lighting.

### Built-in Samsung Microwave Ovens

Built-in microwaves integrate directly into your kitchen cabinets or wall. They offer a very sleek and custom look. These are the most expensive type of Samsung microwave oven. Their price usually starts around $400 and can go up to $700 or more. The higher cost covers the design and often larger capacity.

Built-in models require specific cabinet cutouts. This can add to the overall cost if you need custom installation. They are perfect for modern kitchens. They blend seamlessly with your other appliances. Many built-in Samsung microwaves have advanced features. These include convection cooking or smart connectivity.

### Convection Samsung Microwave Ovens

Some Samsung microwaves offer convection cooking. A convection microwave can act as a second oven. It bakes and roasts food using a fan and heating element. This feature greatly increases the versatility of your microwave. You can bake a cake or roast a chicken. This means you do not need to use your main oven for smaller meals.

Samsung convection microwave ovens are available in all types: countertop, OTR, and built-in. Their prices start around $300 and can exceed $600. The specific price depends on the model type and other features. If you are interested in using your microwave for more than just reheating, a convection model is a great choice. You can learn more about how to use Samsung microwave convection oven features to bake and roast. For example, many users find they can even [bake in Samsung microwave](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-bake-in-samsung-microwave) models with convection functionality. You can also explore how to use your [Samsung microwave oven for baking cake](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-samsung-microwave-oven-for-baking-cake) if it has convection capabilities.

### Smart Samsung Microwave Ovens

Samsung also offers smart microwave ovens. These microwaves connect to your home Wi-Fi. You can control them with your smartphone. You can also use voice commands through smart home assistants like Bixby or Alexa. Smart features might include remote start, cooking preset downloads, or diagnostic tools.

These smart models are typically at the higher end of the price spectrum. They usually cost from $350 to over $600. The convenience of remote control and integration with your smart home system adds value. If you like smart home technology, a Samsung smart microwave oven is a great choice.

## Key Features Impacting Samsung Microwave Price

Beyond the type, specific features play a big role in how much a Samsung microwave oven costs. Understanding these features helps you choose a model that meets your needs without overspending. I will detail the main features that affect price.

### Wattage and Capacity

Higher wattage means faster cooking. Basic Samsung microwaves might have 700-900 watts. These are good for simple tasks. More powerful models can have 1000-1200 watts. They cook food more evenly and quickly. Higher wattage usually means a higher price.

Capacity refers to the interior space, measured in cubic feet. Smaller models (0.7-0.9 cu. ft.) are cheaper. They fit well in small kitchens. Larger models (1.6-2.2 cu. ft. or more) can accommodate bigger dishes. These are more expensive but offer more versatility. Consider your typical dish sizes before buying.

### Sensor Cooking Technology

Sensor cooking is a valuable feature. Microwaves with this technology have a humidity sensor. The sensor detects the moisture released from food as it cooks. It then adjusts the cooking time and power level automatically. This prevents overcooking or undercooking.

This feature adds to the price of a Samsung microwave oven. It provides convenience and better cooking results. If you often find your food dry or unevenly heated, sensor cooking is a feature worth paying for. It takes the guesswork out of cooking.

### Advanced Cooking Modes

Many Samsung microwaves offer more than just basic reheating. Some models include specific cooking modes like:

*   **Defrost:** Advanced defrost cycles that thaw food more evenly.
*   **Reheat:** Optimized settings for different types of leftovers.
*   **Melt/Soften:** Gentle heat for butter, chocolate, or ice cream.
*   **Air Fry:** Some newer models can even air fry foods, offering crisp results. This adds a lot to the microwave's function.

Convection is another advanced mode, as discussed earlier. Each added cooking mode generally increases the price. If you plan to use your microwave for diverse cooking tasks, these modes are beneficial.

### Design and Finish

The design and finish of a Samsung microwave also affect its cost. Stainless steel finishes are common and often cost more than black or white models. They offer a sleek, modern look. Fingerprint-resistant finishes are also available on some models. These help keep your appliance looking clean with less effort.

Premium designs, such as hidden controls or unique handle styles, can also drive up the price. Consider how the microwave will look in your kitchen. A good design choice can enhance your kitchen's overall appearance.

## Where to Buy Samsung Microwave Ovens and Find Deals

You have many options when buying a Samsung microwave oven. Knowing where to look helps you find the best price. I will share common places to buy and tips for finding deals.

They also offer delivery and installation services. This is especially helpful for over-the-range or built-in models. Sales events at these retailers are common. Keep an eye out for holiday sales or special promotions.

### Online Marketplaces

When buying online, check shipping costs and return policies. Look for customer reviews to help guide your decision. Sometimes, you can find exclusive online deals. Signing up for email newsletters from these sites can alert you to sales.

### Discount and Outlet Stores

For the most budget-conscious shoppers, discount and outlet stores might offer good deals. Stores like Costco, Sam's Club, or appliance outlet centers sometimes have special pricing. They might sell floor models, open-box items, or slightly dented appliances at a reduced cost.

Always inspect items carefully at these stores. Make sure the warranty is still valid. While you might save money, the selection can be limited. It is worth checking if you are flexible on the exact model.
