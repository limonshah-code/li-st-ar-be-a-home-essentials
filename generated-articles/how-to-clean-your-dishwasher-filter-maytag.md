### How do I clean my Maytag dishwasher filter?

To clean your Maytag dishwasher filter, first, remove the bottom rack. Locate the filter assembly in the tub's base. Twist or lift out the coarse filter and fine mesh filter.

## Why Cleaning Your Maytag Dishwasher Filter Matters

Maintaining your Maytag dishwasher requires regular cleaning of its filter. This small component plays a big role in how well your appliance works. Think of it as your dishwasherâ€™s primary defense against food debris. It catches leftover food bits, grease, and other particles from your dishes. Without a clean filter, these particles recirculate during the wash cycle. This leaves grime on your "clean" dishes.

A dirty filter affects more than just dish cleanliness. It can cause unpleasant odors inside your dishwasher. Food particles trapped in the filter break down over time. This creates a stale, rotten smell. Your kitchen can also start to smell bad. Furthermore, a clogged filter stresses your dishwasher's pump and motor. This leads to inefficient operation and potential breakdowns. You might notice your Maytag dishwasher not cleaning dishes properly or [why your Maytag dishwasher is not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-maytag-dishwasher-not-draining). Cleaning the filter extends your appliance's life. It also ensures efficient and effective cleaning results.

Ignoring filter cleaning can lead to bigger problems. The dishwasher might struggle to spray water with enough force. This is because the pump works harder to push water through a restricted flow. Over time, this constant strain can wear out parts. It means more costly repairs or even needing a new dishwasher. Regular maintenance, including knowing [how often you should clean your dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-often-should-you-clean-your-dishwasher-filter), saves you money.

## Identifying Your Maytag Dishwasher Filter Type

Maytag dishwashers use different filter designs. Knowing your model's specific filter type helps you clean it properly. Most Maytag dishwashers feature a two-part filter system. This system includes a coarse filter and a fine mesh filter. The coarse filter is usually a cylindrical part. It sits at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It catches larger food pieces. The fine mesh filter surrounds or sits inside the coarse filter. It traps smaller particles. Together, they prevent debris from recirculating onto your dishes.

Some older Maytag models might have a self-cleaning filter system. These systems typically use a hard food disposer. The disposer grinds up food particles. This means less manual filter cleaning for you. However, most modern Maytag dishwashers use manual filters. This design is quieter and more energy-efficient. It does require regular maintenance. You must manually remove and clean these filters. Check your dishwasher's user manual if you are unsure about your model's filter type. The manual provides specific instructions and diagrams.

To identify your filter, open the dishwasher door. Look at the bottom of the tub. You will see a round or cylindrical part in the center or back. This is typically the filter assembly.

Next, apply a small amount of mild dish soap to the filter parts. Use your soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to gently scrub all surfaces. Pay close attention to the mesh screens. These tiny holes often trap stubborn bits of food and grease. Scrub both the inside and outside of the cylindrical coarse filter. Also, clean the fine mesh filter thoroughly. Make sure you get into all the grooves and crevices. You might see a slimy film or dark residue. This is normal. It indicates trapped grease and hard water deposits. Scrub until these areas feel clean and smooth.

For heavily soiled filters, consider soaking them first. Fill a small bowl with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Let the filter components soak for 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen dried-on food and grease. After soaking, proceed with the scrubbing. Once you finish scrubbing, rinse both filter parts under warm water again.

## Reinstalling Your Maytag Dishwasher Filter Correctly

Once your Maytag dishwasher filter components are sparkling clean and fully rinsed, it is time to put them back. Correct reinstallation is just as important as proper cleaning. A poorly installed filter can lead to leaks or continued poor dishwasher performance. Take your time with this step. It ensures your dishwasher works as it should.

First, make sure both the coarse filter and fine mesh filter are completely dry. You can use a paper towel to absorb any excess water. Dry components are less likely to harbor mildew or attract new debris quickly. Locate the filter housing at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. It is the same spot you removed the filter from. Ensure no debris or particles remain inside the housing itself. You can wipe it clean with a damp cloth if needed.

The fine mesh filter creates a tight seal. Next, carefully insert the coarse filter. It should fit over or inside the fine mesh filter. Align its tabs or arrows with the corresponding slots in the dishwasher tub. Gently press down and twist clockwise until it locks into place. You should feel a click or a firm stop. This means the filter is secure. Give it a gentle tug to ensure it is not loose. Replacing the filter correctly prevents problems. Now you know [how to put a dishwasher filter back in](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-dishwasher-filter-back-in) on your Maytag appliance.

## Maintaining Your Maytag Dishwasher Filter: Frequency and Tips

Regular maintenance of your Maytag dishwasher filter keeps your appliance running at its best. Cleaning the filter is not a one-time task. It is an ongoing part of good appliance care. How often you clean it depends on your dishwasher usage. For most households, cleaning the filter once a month is a good rule. If you use your dishwasher daily or wash very dirty dishes, you might need to clean it more often. A good indicator is when you start to see food particles on your dishes or notice bad odors.

Beyond regular cleaning, there are other tips for maintaining your Maytag dishwasher filter. Scrape large food particles off plates before loading them. This reduces the amount of debris that reaches the filter. While pre-rinsing is often unnecessary with modern detergents, removing bulky food helps. Avoid overloading your dishwasher. Too many dishes can block spray arms and prevent proper water circulation. This allows more food particles to settle in the filter. Using a high-quality dishwasher detergent also helps. Some detergents include enzymes that break down food particles.

Consider running an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner every few months. This helps remove grease buildup in the entire system, including the filter housing. This prevents it from getting clogged again quickly. Regularly checking the filter is a simple habit. It ensures your Maytag dishwasher continues to deliver sparkling clean dishes. Consistent filter maintenance also extends the lifespan of your appliance. It prevents issues like [why your Maytag dishwasher is not getting water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-maytag-dishwasher-not-getting-water) because of blockages.

*   **Pre-Scrape Dishes:** Remove large food scraps before loading.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Ensure water can circulate freely.
