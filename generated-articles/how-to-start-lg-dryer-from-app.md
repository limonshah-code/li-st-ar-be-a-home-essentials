*   **Install ThinQ App:** Download and set up the LG ThinQ app on your smartphone.
*   **Connect Dryer:** Register your LG dryer to your ThinQ account via Wi-Fi.

### How do I start my LG dryer remotely using the LG ThinQ app?

To start your LG dryer remotely using the LG ThinQ app, first ensure your dryer is Wi-Fi connected and the "Remote Start" function is activated on its control panel. Then, load your laundry and close the dryer door. Open the LG ThinQ app, select your dryer, choose the desired drying cycle and options, then tap the "Start" button to begin the cycle.

## Embracing Smart Drying: The LG ThinQ Advantage

Smart home technology simplifies daily tasks. LG smart dryers exemplify this trend. They offer advanced features that connect to your smartphone. The LG ThinQ app acts as your command center. I find it very helpful to manage laundry on the go.

This connectivity means you do not need to be physically present to start a cycle. You can start your LG dryer from the app while at work or running errands. This saves time and provides peace of mind. You can manage your home from anywhere.

The LG ThinQ app does more than just start cycles. It provides status updates. You can see how much time remains. It also sends notifications when the cycle finishes. This prevents clothes from sitting too long. Remote control makes laundry more efficient. This is a clear benefit of owning a smart appliance. It truly integrates into a modern lifestyle.

## Checking Compatibility: Is Your LG Dryer Smart-Ready?

Before you attempt to start your LG dryer from the app, confirm its smart capabilities. Not all LG dryer models are Wi-Fi enabled. Only models with LG ThinQ or SmartThinQ technology can connect to the app. You need to verify this feature.

Look for a Wi-Fi logo or "ThinQ" branding on your dryer's control panel. You can also check your dryer's user manual. It will list smart features and connectivity requirements. My experience confirms that identifying the correct model is the first step. You can also visit LG's official website. They provide lists of smart appliance models.

If your dryer is not smart-ready, it cannot connect to the app. You will not be able to start it remotely. Upgrading your dryer might be an option if remote control is important to you. Many newer LG dryer models come with this feature standard. It is worth checking your current appliance first.

## Getting Started: Setting Up Your LG ThinQ App and Dryer

Setting up your LG ThinQ app and connecting your dryer is a straightforward process. This is the foundation for remote operation. First, download the LG ThinQ app onto your smartphone. It is available for both iOS and Android devices. Search for "LG ThinQ" in your device's app store.

Once installed, open the app and create an LG account. If you already have an LG account, simply log in. The app will guide you through the registration process. You will need to agree to terms and conditions. I found this part quick and easy.

Next, you need to add your LG dryer to the app. Select the "Add Appliance" option within the app. Choose "Dryer" from the list of appliance types. The app will then instruct you on how to connect your specific dryer model to your home Wi-Fi network. This usually involves pressing a button combination on the dryer. You then connect your phone to a temporary dryer network. Finally, you choose your home Wi-Fi and enter the password. Follow the on-screen prompts carefully. Once connected, your dryer will appear in your app's dashboard. You can then begin to explore its remote capabilities.

## Enabling Remote Control: Preparing Your LG Dryer for App Start

Before you can start your LG dryer from the app, you must activate the remote control function on the dryer itself. This is a crucial safety measure. LG designs its appliances so they cannot be started unexpectedly from outside the home. You need to prepare the dryer first.

Most LG smart dryers have a "Remote Start" or "Smart Grid" button. You must press this button on the dryer's control panel. Pressing it enables the remote operation mode. The dryer will usually display an icon, such as a Wi-Fi symbol or a house, to indicate that remote start is active. This setting typically remains active for a period. Sometimes it resets after a cycle or after the door is opened.

For many LG dryers, the door must be closed for remote start to function. The lint filter must also be clean and properly seated. These are standard safety checks. Additionally, ensure the dryer has power. The control panel must be responsive. If the dryer enters a "sleep" mode, you may need to wake it up first. This ensures the appliance is ready to receive commands.

### Key Considerations for Remote Start:

*   **Door Closed:** The dryer door must be fully shut.
*   **Remote Start Button:** Activate the "Remote Start" or "Smart Grid" button on the dryer's panel.
*   **Power On:** Ensure the dryer is plugged in and has power.
*   **Lint Filter:** Clean and properly install the lint filter.
*   **No Active Cycle:** The dryer cannot be running a cycle already.
*   **Child Lock (if applicable):** Ensure child lock is not enabled, as this can prevent remote start.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues: When Your LG Dryer Won't Start Remotely

Sometimes, your LG dryer might not start from the app. This can be frustrating, but most issues have simple solutions. I have encountered a few of these myself. Understanding common problems helps resolve them quickly. You can often fix these issues without calling for service.

First, check your Wi-Fi connection. Both your phone and your dryer need a stable internet connection. Ensure your home Wi-Fi is working. Confirm the dryer is connected to the network. Sometimes, simply restarting your home router can fix connectivity issues. Also, make sure the dryer is within range of your Wi-Fi signal.

Next, verify the dryer's physical state. Is the door fully closed? Is the lint filter clean and correctly inserted? Has the "Remote Start" button been pressed on the dryer's control panel? This button needs activation before each remote start. The dryer will not obey commands otherwise. If the dryer enters "sleep" mode, you might need to manually wake it up first. Lastly, check for any error codes on the dryer's display. These codes can point to specific problems preventing operation. Refer to your dryer's manual for error code meanings.

*   **App Status:** Is the LG ThinQ app updated to the latest version? Is it logged in correctly?
*   **Dryer Readiness:**
    *   Is the dryer door completely closed?
    *   Is the lint filter clean and properly seated?
    *   Did you press the "Remote Start" or "Smart Grid" button on the dryer's panel?
    *   Is the dryer powered on and not in standby or sleep mode?
*   **Error Codes:** Check the dryer's display for any error messages.
*   **Obstructions:** Ensure nothing is blocking the door latch.
*   **Power Supply:** Verify the dryer is plugged in and receiving power.
*   **App Restart:** Try closing and reopening the LG ThinQ app on your phone.
*   **Dryer Reset:** Unplug the dryer for a few minutes, then plug it back in. This can sometimes clear minor glitches.
