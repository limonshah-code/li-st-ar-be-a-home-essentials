## Why Does My Kenmore Dishwasher Not Drain?

Imagine opening your dishwasher door after a cycle, ready to put away sparkling clean dishes. Instead, you find standing water at the bottom, and your dishes are still dirty. This is a frustrating problem. When your Kenmore dishwasher does not drain, it stops working properly. It can leave food particles and dirty water inside the appliance.

This issue is common for many homeowners. You might wonder what went wrong. I understand your frustration. Many times, you can fix this problem yourself without calling a technician. This guide will help you understand why your Kenmore dishwasher might not drain. We will cover common causes, step-by-step troubleshooting, and simple solutions. By the end, you will know how to get your Kenmore dishwasher draining smoothly again. Let's get started.

### Takeaway

If your Kenmore dishwasher does not drain, check these common issues first:
*   Clear the filter and drain basket.
*   Inspect the drain hose for kinks or clogs.
*   Check the air gap for blockages.
*   Ensure your garbage disposal is clear.
*   Look for issues with the drain pump or electrical supply.

### Why Your Kenmore Dishwasher Is Not Draining

Your Kenmore dishwasher likely is not draining due to a clog in the filter, drain hose, or air gap. A problem with your garbage disposal connection, a failing drain pump, or an electrical issue can also stop drainage. Most times, simple cleaning or minor adjustments resolve these problems.

## Understanding Why Your Kenmore Dishwasher Doesn't Drain

When your Kenmore dishwasher leaves standing water, several common culprits are usually at play. Knowing these potential problems helps you find the right solution quickly. I have seen many people feel overwhelmed by this issue. However, breaking it down makes it much easier to tackle. We will look at each main reason why your Kenmore might refuse to drain water. This will give you a clear starting point for your investigation.

### Clogged Filters and Drain Baskets

One of the most frequent reasons a Kenmore dishwasher does not drain is a clogged filter or drain basket. Over time, food particles, grease, and debris accumulate in these areas. The filter prevents large items from entering the drain pump. When it gets too full, water cannot pass through efficiently. This blockage stops the water from draining out of the tub. Regular cleaning of these parts prevents many drainage issues.

### Issues with the Drain Hose

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. This hose can develop kinks or blockages. A kink in the hose restricts water flow completely. Food debris or grease can also build up inside the hose, forming a clog. Checking the drain hose for proper routing and clear passage is a key troubleshooting step. Sometimes, the hose just needs a simple adjustment. You can learn more about general drainage issues by visiting our guide on [when dishwasher does not drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/when-dishwasher-does-not-drain).

### Problems with the Air Gap

Some Kenmore dishwashers use an air gap. This small cylinder sits on your sink counter near the faucet. It prevents dirty sink water from flowing back into the dishwasher. If the air gap gets clogged with food particles or gunk, it can stop your dishwasher from draining. Water may even bubble up from the air gap cover. Cleaning this device is simple but often overlooked.

### Garbage Disposal Connection Hiccups

If your Kenmore dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, the disposal must be clear. New garbage disposals often have a knockout plug inside the inlet. If this plug is not removed during installation, the dishwasher cannot drain. Even an existing disposal can become clogged. Running the disposal regularly, especially before starting the dishwasher, helps prevent this issue. Make sure the disposal is not full of food waste.

### A Failing Drain Pump

The drain pump moves water out of the dishwasher. If the pump motor fails or an object jams its impeller, water will not drain. You might hear a humming sound from the dishwasher without any water movement. This indicates the pump is trying to work but cannot. A faulty pump requires replacement. Sometimes, a small piece of glass or bone can get stuck in the pump. Understanding [how to get the dishwasher to drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-the-dishwasher-to-drain) often involves checking this crucial component.

### Electrical Glitches and Resets

Sometimes, the problem is not a clog but an electrical hiccup. A power surge can cause the dishwasher's control panel to malfunction. This can prevent it from starting the drain cycle. A simple reset of the dishwasher or its circuit breaker might resolve the issue. This is a quick fix that should always be tried first. It costs nothing and often works.

## First Steps: Cleaning Your Kenmore Dishwasher's Filter

Before you dive into complex fixes, start with the easiest and most common solution: cleaning the dishwasher filter. This step often resolves Kenmore dishwasher drainage issues. I recommend doing this regularly as part of your appliance maintenance. It prevents future clogs. You will need gloves, a sponge, and a small brush for this task. It is a straightforward process.

### Locating the Filter

First, open your Kenmore dishwasher door. Look at the bottom of the tub. You will see a cylindrical or flat filter assembly. Kenmore models often have a multi-part filter system. It usually includes a coarse filter and a fine filter. The coarse filter is typically a larger cup or basket. The fine filter is a mesh screen beneath it. Refer to your owner's manual if you have trouble finding it. Each Kenmore model might have slight variations.

### Removing the Filter

Most Kenmore dishwasher filters twist counter-clockwise to unlock. Some might have clips or latches. Gently lift the filter assembly out of the dishwasher. Be prepared for some residual water and debris. Place the removed filter in your sink. You will notice accumulated food particles, grease, and other grime. This is completely normal but needs to be cleaned. This buildup is often why your Kenmore dishwasher is not draining.

### Cleaning the Filter Thoroughly

Rinse the filter under warm running water. Use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away any stuck-on debris. You can use a mild dish soap to cut through grease. Pay close attention to the mesh screen. Ensure all holes are clear. If you find stubborn particles, a toothpick can help dislodge them. After cleaning, inspect the filter to make sure it is spotless. Every little bit of gunk needs to go. For detailed instructions on your specific model, review our guide on [how to clean dishwasher filter kenmore](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-kenmore).

### Cleaning the Filter Housing and Reassembly

While the filter is out, wipe the filter housing area at the bottom of the dishwasher. Food bits can collect there too. Use a damp cloth or sponge. Once the filter is clean and the housing is wiped down, place the filter back into its spot. Twist it clockwise or secure the clips until it locks firmly. Run a short rinse cycle with no dishes to test the drainage. This process helps ensure water flows freely. Regular cleaning, perhaps once a month, will prevent many future problems. You can also refer to our guide on [how to clean dishwasher filter and drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-filter-and-drain) for a broader approach to drain maintenance.

## Inspecting and Clearing the Kenmore Dishwasher Drain Hose

Once you have checked the filter, the next common culprit for a Kenmore dishwasher not draining is the drain hose. This hose connects the dishwasher to your sink's drain or garbage disposal. It can easily become kinked or clogged. Checking this hose requires a bit more effort than the filter. However, it is still a DIY task. I always recommend disconnecting power before touching any appliance parts.

### Locating and Accessing the Drain Hose

The drain hose typically runs from the back of the dishwasher to under your kitchen sink. You might need to pull the dishwasher slightly out of its cabinet for full access to the back. If the hose connects directly to the sink drain, it will be visible under the sink. If it goes to a garbage disposal, it connects to an inlet port on the disposal unit. Make sure you can see the entire length of the hose. This lets you spot any obvious issues.

### Checking for Kinks and Bends

Visually inspect the entire length of the drain hose. Look for any sharp bends or kinks. A hose that is not properly installed or has been pushed against a wall can get crimped. This immediately stops water flow. Gently straighten any kinks you find. Ensure the hose has a gradual slope from the dishwasher to the drain. Proper elevation helps water drain by gravity. If the hose sags, it can create a trap where water sits. This is called a low loop.

### Checking for Clogs Inside the Hose

Clogs inside the hose are harder to spot. They are often caused by food debris, grease, or even small foreign objects that bypassed the filter.
You might need to disconnect the hose from both ends to check for blockages.
1.  **Disconnect:** Place a towel and bucket under the hose connections before disconnecting. Water will likely spill out. Loosen the clamps holding the hose at the dishwasher and at the sink/disposal.
2.  **Inspect:** Look inside the hose from both ends with a flashlight. You might see the clog.
3.  **Clear:** Use a long, flexible brush, like a bottle brush, or a plumber's snake to clear any obstructions. Push it through the hose gently.
4.  **Rinse:** Run water through the hose in the sink to confirm it is clear.
Reconnect the hose securely with clamps. Ensure there are no leaks. You can find more tips on how to effectively [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain) in a comprehensive guide.

### Ensuring Proper Hose Installation

Make sure the drain hose has a high loop. The highest point of the hose should be above the dishwasher's drain connection. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It also stops water from draining continuously. The high loop is crucial for proper drainage. Secure the hose in place with a clamp or zip tie if needed. After ensuring the hose is clear and properly routed, run another test cycle. This will confirm if your Kenmore dishwasher now drains as it should.

## Checking the Air Gap and Garbage Disposal for Kenmore Drain Issues

Beyond the dishwasher itself, external components often affect drainage. The air gap and your garbage disposal are two common areas to check. If your Kenmore dishwasher does not drain, problems with these can be the root cause. I have seen many people overlook these external checks. They are relatively easy to inspect and clear.

### Inspecting and Clearing the Air Gap

If your dishwasher uses an air gap, it is typically a small, chrome cylinder on your kitchen counter, usually near the faucet.
1.  **Remove the Cover:** Twist off the top cover of the air gap.
2.  **Remove the Cap:** Pull off the decorative cap beneath it.
3.  **Check for Clogs:** You will see two hoses connected to the air gap. One comes from the dishwasher, and the other goes to the garbage disposal or drain. Look for any visible debris or gunk inside the air gap.
4.  **Clear Blockages:** Use a small brush or a toothpick to clear any obstructions. You can also run water through the sink to see if it backs up into the air gap. If water bubbles up, it means there's a clog.
5.  **Reassemble:** Put the cap and cover back on securely.

A clogged air gap prevents proper air circulation, which is vital for the dishwasher to drain effectively.

### Addressing Garbage Disposal Connection Issues

Many Kenmore dishwashers drain directly into the garbage disposal unit. If you have a disposal, its condition directly impacts dishwasher drainage.
1.  **Run the Disposal:** Always run your garbage disposal for about 30 seconds before starting the dishwasher. This clears any food waste that might be blocking the drain path.
2.  **Check for Knockout Plug:** If you recently installed a new garbage disposal, ensure the knockout plug was removed. This plug is inside the disposal's dishwasher inlet port. If it is still there, your dishwasher will never drain. To check, disconnect the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Look inside the inlet port. If you see a metal plug, carefully knock it out with a hammer and screwdriver. Then reattach the hose.
3.  **Clear Disposal Clogs:** Even without a knockout plug, the disposal can become clogged. Run the disposal with plenty of water. If it is struggling, try clearing it with ice cubes and a bit of dish soap. Avoid putting your hand inside the disposal.
4.  **Hose Connection:** Ensure the dishwasher drain hose is securely clamped to the garbage disposal's inlet. A loose connection can cause leaks or drainage issues.

By ensuring your air gap and garbage disposal are functioning correctly, you eliminate two major external reasons why your Kenmore dishwasher is not draining. These are simple checks that can save you a service call.

## Troubleshooting the Kenmore Dishwasher Drain Pump

If you have checked the filters, drain hose, air gap, and garbage disposal, and your Kenmore dishwasher still does not drain, the issue might be with the drain pump. The drain pump is a motor that actively pushes water out of the dishwasher tub. When it fails or gets jammed, water has nowhere to go. Identifying a faulty drain pump often involves listening to the appliance and performing a few simple checks.

### Signs of a Failing Drain Pump

You might notice specific signs if the drain pump is the problem.
*   **Humming Sound, No Drain:** You hear a humming noise during the drain cycle, but no water moves out of the tub. This often means the motor is trying to run but is jammed or defective.
*   **No Sound at All:** The dishwasher completes its cycle, but you hear no sound during the drain phase. This could indicate a completely failed motor or an electrical issue preventing the pump from starting.
*   **Partial Drain:** Some water drains, but a significant amount remains. This might indicate a weak pump or a partial obstruction within the pump assembly.

### Accessing the Drain Pump

Accessing the drain pump can be more involved than previous steps. It usually requires pulling the dishwasher out from its cabinet.
1.  **Disconnect Power:** Always unplug the dishwasher or turn off its circuit breaker before attempting any internal repairs. Safety first is my rule.
2.  **Remove Kick Plate:** Most dishwashers have a lower access panel or kick plate. Remove the screws holding it in place. This will give you access to the components underneath the tub.
3.  **Locate the Pump:** The drain pump is typically found at the bottom front of the dishwasher, usually below the motor. It is a round component with hoses connected to it.

### Checking for Obstructions in the Pump

Sometimes, a small object can get past the filter and jam the pump's impeller.
1.  **Disconnect Hoses:** You might need to disconnect the drain hoses attached to the pump. Have towels ready for any water spills.
2.  **Inspect Impeller:** Look into the pump opening for any foreign objects. Small pieces of glass, bone, or even plastic can jam the impeller blades.
3.  **Remove Debris:** Carefully remove any visible obstructions. You might need needle-nose pliers or tweezers. Be gentle to avoid damaging the impeller.
4.  **Test Impeller:** Once clear, try to spin the impeller manually. It should turn freely. If it feels stiff or does not move, the pump may be defective.

### Testing the Drain Pump (Advanced)

If no visible obstruction is present, the pump motor itself might be bad. This usually requires a multimeter to test for continuity or proper voltage. If you are not comfortable with electrical testing, this is a good point to call a professional. A new drain pump for a Kenmore dishwasher can be purchased and installed. However, it requires some technical skill. If water is just standing, you can manually drain out the water from the dishwasher before tackling the pump. Our guide on [how to drain out water from dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-out-water-from-dishwasher) provides steps for this. If the pump is confirmed faulty, replacing it should resolve your Kenmore dishwasher's drainage problem.

## Electrical Resets and Other Simple Fixes for Kenmore Dishwasher Not Draining

Sometimes, the issue is not a clog or a broken part but a simple electrical problem. A Kenmore dishwasher might stop draining if its control system encounters a glitch. These issues are often easy to fix with a quick reset. I always try these steps before considering more complex repairs. They take very little time and cost nothing.

### Performing a Hard Reset

A hard reset can clear temporary errors in the dishwasher's control board.
1.  **Turn Off Power:** Go to your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position.
2.  **Wait:** Leave the power off for at least 5 minutes. This allows the control board to fully discharge and reset.
3.  **Restore Power:** Flip the breaker back to the "on" position.
4.  **Test:** Run a short cycle or the drain cycle on your dishwasher. See if it drains properly now. This simple power cycle often resolves electronic glitches that cause a Kenmore dishwasher not to drain.

### Checking the Dishwasher's Control Panel

Some Kenmore dishwashers have specific reset procedures built into their control panels. Consult your owner's manual for your specific model's reset sequence. This might involve pressing certain buttons in a specific order. For example, some models require pressing the "Heated Dry" button five times in a row. This type of soft reset can also clear minor programming errors. Ensure no error codes are displayed on the panel. If an error code appears, look it up in your manual. It can point to a specific component failure.

### Ensuring Proper Cycle Selection

It might seem obvious, but sometimes the issue is simply an incorrect cycle selection. Some cycles, like "Sani Rinse" or "Extra Dry," add more water or extend drying time. If the dishwasher stops mid-cycle, it might still be in a phase that holds water. Ensure the cycle has fully completed. If the cycle finishes but water remains, then it is a drainage problem. Pressing the "Cancel/Drain" button (if your model has one) can force the dishwasher into a drain-only cycle. This helps confirm if the pump is operational.

### Inspecting Power Cords and Outlets

While rare, a loose power cord or a faulty outlet can sometimes interrupt power to the drain pump. Ensure the dishwasher's power cord is securely plugged into a working outlet. Avoid using extension cords. If the outlet seems dead, test it with another small appliance. If your Kenmore dishwasher is hardwired, inspect the wiring connections at the junction box. If you are not comfortable with electrical work, contact a qualified electrician. These basic electrical checks ensure your dishwasher is receiving consistent power to complete all its functions, including draining water.

## When Professional Help is Needed for Your Kenmore Dishwasher

While many Kenmore dishwasher drainage issues are fixable by the homeowner, some problems require professional expertise. Knowing when to call a technician can save you time, further damage, and frustration. I always advise calling a pro if you are unsure or if the problem persists after trying all DIY steps. Do not risk personal injury or further appliance damage.

### Persistent Drainage Problems

You have tried cleaning the filter, checking the hose, clearing the air gap, and resetting the dishwasher. You have even checked the garbage disposal. Yet, your Kenmore dishwasher still does not drain. If you have exhausted all common troubleshooting steps, it is time to consider professional help. A persistent issue suggests a deeper, possibly mechanical or electrical problem. These complex issues often need specialized tools and knowledge to diagnose and repair.

### Suspected Component Failure

If you suspect the drain pump, control board, or other internal components are faulty, a technician is your best bet.
*   **Drain Pump:** If the pump hums but does not drain, or makes no sound at all after power resets, it likely needs replacement. Replacing a pump involves dealing with water, electrical connections, and sometimes disassembling parts of the dishwasher.
*   **Control Board:** If the dishwasher behaves erratically, displays unusual error codes, or does not respond to commands, the control board might be faulty. These are expensive parts, and precise diagnosis is crucial.
*   **Wiring Issues:** If you find burned wires, frayed connections, or smell burning plastic, immediately disconnect power and call an electrician or appliance repair specialist. Electrical issues are serious.

Attempting to replace complex parts without proper training can lead to further damage. It can also void your warranty.
