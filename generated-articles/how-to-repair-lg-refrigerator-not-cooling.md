## Fixing Your LG Refrigerator: When It Stops Cooling

Imagine opening your LG refrigerator door, expecting a cool rush, but finding everything warm. This situation causes frustration. A refrigerator not cooling can spoil food quickly. I know this feeling well from my own experiences. This article helps you understand why your LG refrigerator stops cooling. We will guide you through common problems and simple repair steps. You can diagnose the issue yourself. This guide saves you time and money on service calls.

### Takeaway

When your LG refrigerator stops cooling, take specific actions to find the problem.
*   **Check basic power and temperature settings first.** A simple adjustment fixes many issues.

*   **Consider professional help for sealed system issues.** These repairs need specialized tools.

A typical LG refrigerator not cooling issue comes from problems with the condenser coils, condenser fan, evaporator fan, or defrost system. You can often fix these problems yourself. Start with basic checks. Then move to internal component inspection.

### Initial Checks: Power, Settings, and Placement

Before diving into complex repairs, perform some basic checks. These steps solve many common refrigerator problems. Sometimes, the fix is very simple. I always start here when my own fridge acts up.

#### Power Supply and Circuit Breaker

First, ensure your LG refrigerator receives power. Check if the power cord is securely plugged into the wall outlet. A loose plug stops power flow. Next, go to your home's circuit breaker box. Locate the breaker labeled for your kitchen or refrigerator. Ensure the breaker is in the "ON" position. If it tripped, reset it by flipping it to "OFF" and then back to "ON." Sometimes, a power surge trips the breaker. Your refrigerator needs a dedicated circuit. Overloaded circuits cause trips.

Also, test the outlet itself. Plug in a small appliance, like a lamp, into the same outlet. If the lamp does not turn on, the outlet has no power. This indicates an electrical issue outside the refrigerator. You might need an electrician for outlet problems. Always unplug the refrigerator before any deeper inspection. Safety is very important.

#### Temperature Settings and Modes

Check the temperature settings on your LG refrigerator. Accidentally changed settings can cause cooling issues. Make sure the refrigerator temperature is set between 35 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 4.4 degrees Celsius). The freezer should be set to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius). Many LG models have a digital display. Verify these settings are correct.

Some LG refrigerators have a "Demo Mode" or "Showroom Mode." In this mode, the lights and display work, but the cooling system turns off. This prevents energy use in a store setting. Refer to your LG refrigerator's user manual to disable this mode. The method varies by model. Usually, it involves holding down a combination of buttons for a few seconds. If your refrigerator lights are on but it makes no cooling sounds, check for this mode.

#### Refrigerator Placement and Airflow

Proper placement is important for your refrigerator's performance. The condenser coils release heat. They need enough space to dissipate this heat effectively. Ensure your LG refrigerator has at least a few inches of clearance from walls and cabinets. Do not push it too close to any surface. Poor air circulation around the coils leads to overheating. This reduces cooling efficiency.

Check for obstructions behind or on top of the unit. Objects blocking vents or the condenser area limit airflow. Overheating components struggle to cool the interior. Also, avoid placing the refrigerator in direct sunlight or near heat sources like ovens. External heat makes the refrigerator work harder. This can strain the cooling system. Proper ventilation helps your LG refrigerator run at its best.

### The Condenser System: Coils & Fan

The condenser system is crucial for cooling. It releases heat from inside the refrigerator into the room. This system includes condenser coils and a condenser fan motor. If these parts fail, your LG refrigerator stops cooling properly. I have seen many refrigerators fail due to dirty coils.

#### Dirty Condenser Coils

Dirty condenser coils are a leading cause of cooling problems. The coils are usually located on the back or bottom of your LG refrigerator. They collect dust, pet hair, and debris over time. This layer of grime acts as an insulator. It prevents the coils from releasing heat efficiently. When heat cannot escape, the refrigerator struggles to cool down. The compressor works harder, leading to higher energy bills and potential part failure.

To clean the coils, first unplug the refrigerator. Locate the coils. For coils on the back, pull the refrigerator away from the wall. For coils on the bottom, remove the kick plate or access panel. Use a coil brush or a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment. Carefully remove all accumulated dust and debris. Do this at least once or twice a year. Regular cleaning improves cooling performance. It also extends the life of your LG refrigerator. After cleaning, replace any panels. Push the refrigerator back into its place.

#### Faulty Condenser Fan Motor

The condenser fan motor pulls air through the condenser coils. This helps dissipate the heat. If the condenser fan motor fails, the coils overheat. This prevents the refrigerant from cooling. You might hear strange noises from the back of the refrigerator. Or, you might hear no fan noise at all. A faulty fan motor can cause the refrigerator to stop cooling.

First, unplug the refrigerator for safety. Access the condenser fan. It is usually near the compressor at the bottom rear of the unit. Inspect the fan blades. Make sure nothing obstructs their movement. Spin the blades by hand. They should spin freely. If they are stiff or wobbly, the motor might be bad. You can also test the motor for continuity with a multimeter. A lack of continuity indicates a failed motor. Replacing the condenser fan motor is a DIY task for many people. You will need a new motor specific to your LG model. Disconnect the old motor's wires. Then, install the new motor. Reconnect the wires. This repair can bring your cooling back.

### Evaporator Fan & Frost Buildup

Inside the freezer, the evaporator fan circulates cold air throughout the refrigerator and freezer compartments. If this fan stops working, the refrigerator will not cool. Excessive frost buildup can also block airflow. I experienced this with my old refrigerator. The freezer was cold, but the fridge was warm.

#### Evaporator Fan Motor Failure

The evaporator fan motor is inside the freezer compartment. It draws air over the evaporator coils. These coils become cold through the refrigeration process. The fan then pushes this cold air into both the freezer and fresh food sections. If the evaporator fan motor fails, cold air cannot reach the refrigerator compartment. This leaves the fresh food section warm. You might notice the freezer is still cold, but the refrigerator is not.

To check the evaporator fan, first unplug your LG refrigerator. Open the freezer door. Remove any shelves or ice makers that block access. Locate the evaporator fan cover, usually at the back of the freezer. Remove the screws to take off the cover. You will see the fan blades. Try to spin the blades by hand. They should turn freely. If they are stiff or do not turn, the motor is likely faulty. You can also listen for the fan running when the freezer door is closed and power is on. If you hear no fan noise, the motor is likely bad. Replacing this motor involves disconnecting wires and mounting screws. A new evaporator fan motor restores cold air circulation.

#### Excessive Frost Buildup Blocking Airflow

Excessive frost or ice buildup on the evaporator coils is another common problem. This happens if the defrost system fails. The ice acts as an insulator. It prevents cold air from passing over the coils. It also blocks the evaporator fan blades. When the coils are covered in ice, the refrigerator cannot cool the air effectively. The fan might even hit the ice, making noise or stopping completely.

To diagnose this, unplug the refrigerator. Access the evaporator coils in the freezer. If you see a thick layer of ice covering the coils, this is the problem. You can manually defrost the refrigerator. Remove all food. Turn off the refrigerator for 24-48 hours. Keep the doors open. Place towels to catch melting water. This allows all ice to melt. After defrosting, plug the refrigerator back in. If the frost returns quickly, a component in the defrost system is faulty. This suggests a deeper issue needing further repair. For more comprehensive troubleshooting, you can refer to our article on [how to troubleshoot LG refrigerator not cooling](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-troubleshoot-lg-refrigerator-not-cooling).

### Understanding the Defrost System

The defrost system prevents ice buildup on the evaporator coils. It turns on periodically to melt any frost. This system has several key components: a defrost heater, a defrost thermostat, and a defrost control board or timer. A failure in any of these parts leads to cooling issues.

#### Defrost Heater

The defrost heater melts frost from the evaporator coils. This ensures good airflow. If the defrost heater fails, ice builds up on the coils. This stops the coils from absorbing heat from the refrigerator compartment. Over time, the ice becomes a thick block. It obstructs the evaporator fan and prevents cooling. You can test the defrost heater with a multimeter. First, unplug the refrigerator. Access the evaporator coils in the freezer. The heater element usually looks like a long glass tube or metal rod. Disconnect its wires. Set your multimeter to the ohms setting. Place the probes on the heater terminals. A reading of infinity (open circuit) means the heater is faulty and needs replacement. A proper heater will show some resistance.

#### Defrost Thermostat (Bimetal Thermostat)

The defrost thermostat is a safety device. It monitors the temperature of the evaporator coils. When the coil temperature drops below a certain point (usually around 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit), the thermostat closes. This allows power to flow to the defrost heater. Once the ice melts and the coil temperature rises, the thermostat opens. This turns off the heater. If the defrost thermostat fails to close, the heater will not activate. Ice will build up. If it fails to open, the heater might run too long, causing other problems. You can test the defrost thermostat for continuity. It must be very cold for the test to be accurate. You may need to use ice or a freezer for this. If it does not show continuity when cold, it is defective.

#### Defrost Control Board or Timer

Some LG refrigerators use a defrost timer. Other, newer models use a main control board or a dedicated defrost control board. This component regulates the defrost cycle. It tells the defrost heater when to turn on and off. If the timer or board malfunctions, the defrost cycle may not run at all. This leads to severe ice buildup. Or, it might run too often, causing other problems. Testing a defrost timer or control board is more complex. You often need to check continuity at different points in the cycle. Or, you might observe if the heater activates. If other defrost components test good, the board or timer is likely the problem. Replacing a control board or timer can be more costly. Ensure other components are not the cause first. Issues related to a refrigerator not cooling or freezing can sometimes be brand-specific. For example, similar problems can occur in [Frigidaire refrigerators not cooling or freezing](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-frigidaire-refrigerator-not-cooling-or-freezing).

### Damper Control & Temperature Sensors

Proper temperature inside your refrigerator depends on regulated airflow and accurate temperature readings. The damper control and thermistors play key roles. If they malfunction, cooling becomes inconsistent or stops entirely. I have seen instances where a small part like a sensor caused a major cooling problem.

#### Air Damper Control Malfunction

The air damper control regulates the flow of cold air from the freezer to the fresh food compartment. It opens and closes to maintain the set temperature in the refrigerator. If the damper is stuck closed, no cold air reaches the fresh food section. This leaves your food warm. If it is stuck open, the refrigerator might get too cold, potentially freezing items. LG refrigerators often have electronic dampers. These are controlled by the main control board.

To check the damper, first unplug the refrigerator. Locate the damper, usually at the top or back of the fresh food compartment. You might need to remove some shelves or panels. Inspect the damper visually. Check for any obstructions or ice that prevents it from opening or closing. You can manually try to move the damper blade. It should move smoothly. If it is visibly broken or stuck, it needs replacement. You can also listen for the damper motor. If it does not operate when you adjust the temperature, the motor or the control board signal might be faulty. Replacing a faulty damper assembly restores proper air circulation. A similar issue could arise in a [side-by-side refrigerator not cooling](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-side-by-side-refrigerator-not-cooling), indicating a shared design vulnerability across different fridge types.

#### Faulty Thermistor/Temperature Sensor

Thermistors are temperature sensors. They monitor the temperature inside the refrigerator and freezer. They send resistance readings to the main control board. The board uses these readings to control the compressor, fan motors, and defrost system. If a thermistor is faulty, it sends incorrect temperature readings. This can cause the control board to incorrectly cycle the compressor or fans. The refrigerator might not cool enough. Or, it might overcool.

You can test thermistors with a multimeter. First, unplug the refrigerator. Locate the thermistors. There is usually one in the fresh food section and one in the freezer section. They look like small probes. Disconnect the thermistor wires. Measure the resistance (ohms) across the thermistor terminals. Compare the reading to a temperature-resistance chart for your specific LG model. These charts are often in the service manual. If the reading is far off, the thermistor is bad. Replacing a thermistor is generally straightforward. You just disconnect the old one and connect the new one. Ensure the replacement part is compatible with your LG refrigerator model. This small part can have a big impact on cooling performance.

### Compressor & Sealed System Concerns

The compressor and sealed system form the core of your refrigerator's cooling process. They circulate refrigerant to remove heat. Problems here are serious. They often require professional repair. I always advise caution when dealing with these components.

#### Compressor Malfunction

The compressor is the "heart" of your LG refrigerator's cooling system. It pumps refrigerant through the coils. If the compressor fails, the refrigerator will not cool at all. You might hear a clicking sound but no humming, or no sound at all from the compressor area. A faulty compressor is a common reason for total cooling loss. You can usually locate the compressor at the bottom rear of your refrigerator. It looks like a black, dome-shaped component.

To diagnose a compressor issue, listen for it running. Feel if it is vibrating or getting warm when it should be running. If it is silent and cold, it is likely not working. You can also check the start relay on the compressor. This component helps the compressor start. Sometimes, the start relay fails, not the compressor itself. Test the start relay for continuity. If the relay is bad, replacing it might solve the problem. However, if the compressor itself is faulty, replacing it is a complex job. It requires specialized tools and handling of refrigerants. This is not a DIY repair for most homeowners. A certified appliance technician should handle compressor replacements. This helps avoid refrigerant leaks and electrical hazards.

#### Refrigerant Leaks and Blockages

Refrigerant circulates through the sealed system, absorbing and releasing heat. A leak in the sealed system causes a loss of refrigerant. Without enough refrigerant, the refrigerator cannot cool properly. Signs of a refrigerant leak include a lack of cooling and sometimes a faint chemical smell. You might also see oily residue around the coils. Blockages in the sealed system, like a clogged capillary tube, also stop refrigerant flow. This prevents cooling.

Diagnosing refrigerant leaks or blockages requires specialized equipment. Technicians use leak detectors to pinpoint leaks. They also use gauges to measure refrigerant pressure. Attempting to repair a sealed system or add refrigerant without proper training is dangerous and illegal in many places. It also requires specific tools like vacuum pumps and charging stations. If you suspect a refrigerant issue, call a qualified appliance technician. They can safely diagnose and repair sealed system problems. This type of repair is one of the more expensive ones. It means you might need to decide if repairing an older refrigerator is cost-effective.

### Other Common Issues and Prevention

Sometimes, the reason your LG refrigerator is not cooling is simpler than a major component failure. Basic usage and maintenance affect cooling performance. I always remind people about these simple checks. Prevention is always better than repair.

#### Door Seals (Gaskets)

The door seals, also known as gaskets, create an airtight barrier. This barrier keeps cold air inside and warm air out. Over time, door seals can become worn, cracked, or torn. This allows warm air to seep into the refrigerator compartment. The compressor then runs almost constantly. It tries to maintain the set temperature. This leads to poor cooling performance and higher energy bills.

To check your door seals, perform the "dollar bill test." Close the refrigerator door on a dollar bill. If you can easily pull the bill out, the seal is weak at that spot. Repeat this test around the entire door perimeter. Visually inspect the seals for any cracks, tears, or signs of wear. Clean the seals regularly with warm, soapy water. This removes any sticky residue that prevents a good seal. If the seals are damaged, you can often replace them yourself. New door gaskets are available from appliance parts suppliers. Replacing them is a straightforward process. You typically pull off the old gasket and push the new one into place. This quick fix can significantly improve cooling efficiency.

#### Overstuffing and Blocked Vents

Overstuffing your LG refrigerator prevents proper air circulation. Cold air needs space to move around food items. If shelves are too full, or if items block the air vents, cold air cannot reach all areas. This results in warm spots. The fresh food compartment often suffers the most. Do not pack food tightly against the back wall or vents inside the refrigerator and freezer.

Make sure nothing blocks the air vents. These vents are usually located at the back or sides of the compartments. They allow cold air to flow in. Rearrange food items to allow for proper airflow. Maintain a reasonable fill level. This ensures efficient cooling throughout the entire refrigerator. A refrigerator that is too empty can also have problems. An empty refrigerator has less thermal mass to hold cold. It will warm up faster when the door opens. For general troubleshooting, similar principles apply to other brands like [Bosch refrigerators not cooling](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-bosch-refrigerator-not-cooling).

#### Leveling and Ventilation

Your LG refrigerator should be level. Proper leveling ensures the doors close properly and seals effectively. An unlevel refrigerator can stress the door hinges and seals. This leads to gaps that let in warm air. Use a level tool on top of the refrigerator. Adjust the leveling feet at the bottom corners of the unit. Turn the feet clockwise to raise a corner. Turn them counter-clockwise to lower a corner.

Ensure adequate ventilation around the refrigerator. The condenser coils release heat to the surroundings. The refrigerator needs proper clearance from walls and cabinets. Do not push the refrigerator flush against a wall. Allow at least a few inches of space at the back and sides. This space allows heat to dissipate efficiently. If heat gets trapped, the compressor works harder. This reduces cooling performance and shortens the appliance's lifespan. Good ventilation is a simple, yet vital, maintenance step.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Why is my LG refrigerator freezer cold but the fridge is warm?
This often indicates a problem with the evaporator fan or a blockage in the air vent between the freezer and fresh food sections. The evaporator fan circulates cold air from the freezer to the fridge. If it fails, cold air cannot reach the fresh food compartment. Ice buildup on evaporator coils can also block the airflow.

#### How do I reset my LG refrigerator when it's not cooling?
First, unplug the refrigerator for about 5-10 minutes. Then, plug it back in. This hard reset can clear minor electronic glitches. You might also find a specific reset procedure in your LG refrigerator's manual. This often involves holding down certain buttons on the control panel.

#### What is the average lifespan of an LG refrigerator compressor?
LG refrigerator compressors typically last between 10 to 20 years. However, several factors affect this lifespan. These include usage patterns, maintenance frequency, and environmental conditions. Regular cleaning of condenser coils and ensuring proper ventilation can help extend the compressor's life.

#### Can a dirty condenser coil stop my LG fridge from cooling?
Yes, absolutely. Dirty condenser coils are a very common reason for poor cooling. Dust and debris on the coils act as insulation. This prevents the refrigerator from releasing heat efficiently. The compressor then runs harder and hotter. This reduces cooling capacity and increases energy consumption.

#### How much does it cost to fix an LG refrigerator not cooling?
The cost varies greatly depending on the part that needs repair or replacement. Simple fixes like cleaning coils are free. Replacing a fan motor might cost $100-$300 for parts and labor. A new control board could be $200-$600. Compressor replacement or sealed system issues can
