Other manufacturers, including Electrolux and formerly GE Appliances, also produce Kenmore models. The specific manufacturer often depends on the individual model number and the production year.

## The Manufacturing Model for Kenmore Elite Appliances

Sears has a unique business model for its Kenmore line. It does not operate its own appliance factories. Instead, Sears contracts with established appliance manufacturers. These manufacturers design and build appliances. Then, they brand them as Kenmore or Kenmore Elite. This approach allows Sears to offer a wide range of products. It leverages the expertise of top industry players.

This strategy benefits consumers in several ways. You get access to proven technologies. You also benefit from the manufacturing quality of leading brands.

For instance, you might find a Kenmore Elite dishwasher with a design similar to a Whirlpool model. Another might look like an LG product. This is due to the OEM relationship. It is crucial for understanding the product's true origins. This system provides flexibility and innovation.

## Whirlpool's Significant Role in Kenmore Production

Whirlpool Corporation has historically been a primary manufacturer for Kenmore appliances. This includes many Kenmore Elite dishwashers. Their partnership with Sears dates back decades. Whirlpool produces a wide array of home appliances. These include refrigerators, washing machines, and dishwashers. Their manufacturing expertise is vast. Many Kenmore models share core components with Whirlpool-branded appliances.

You might find that a Kenmore Elite dishwasher has similar internal parts to a Whirlpool model. This is because Whirlpool's factories build these units. They then apply the Kenmore branding. This collaboration has been a cornerstone of the Kenmore brand's success. It ensures a consistent level of quality and performance. Whirlpool's strong presence in the market reinforces the reliability of these units. Consumers often trust products made by Whirlpool.

If you own an older Kenmore Elite dishwasher, there is a good chance Whirlpool made it. Their influence extends across various Kenmore appliance categories. They help Sears deliver dependable products to consumers. Knowing this can assist with troubleshooting or parts replacement. Many parts are interchangeable with Whirlpool's own brand. This long-standing relationship has shaped the Kenmore brand significantly.

## LG's Contribution to Kenmore Elite Innovation

LG Electronics has become another major player in manufacturing Kenmore Elite dishwashers. LG is known for its innovative technology and sleek designs. Their involvement has brought new features to the Kenmore Elite lineup. Many advanced models now incorporate LG's patented technologies. These technologies often include quiet operation and efficient washing systems. LG's dishwashers are recognized for their performance.

When you see a Kenmore Elite dishwasher with a modern touch panel or unique rack system, LG might be the manufacturer. LG's commitment to consumer electronics translates into their appliance division. They often introduce smart features and energy-efficient designs. This partnership allows Sears to offer cutting-edge dishwashers. These models compete with other high-end brands. Consumers benefit from LG's research and development.

LG's manufacturing process emphasizes precision and durability. This results in reliable Kenmore Elite dishwashers. If your dishwasher has features like a TrueSteam system or a Linear Compressor motor, LG likely made it. The collaboration ensures Kenmore Elite remains competitive. It offers consumers premium options. This is especially true for those seeking modern appliance solutions.

## The Role of Electrolux and Other Manufacturers

While Whirlpool and LG are prominent, other manufacturers also contribute to the Kenmore Elite line. Electrolux is one such company. Electrolux is a global appliance giant. They produce appliances under various brand names. These include Frigidaire and Electrolux itself. Their expertise in dishwashing technology is considerable. Some Kenmore Elite models might trace their origins back to Electrolux factories.

Electrolux dishwashers are known for their effective cleaning cycles. They also offer thoughtful design elements. Their contributions to Kenmore Elite often focus on these strengths. You might find specific washing programs or rack configurations typical of Electrolux designs. These models still carry the Kenmore Elite branding. This allows Sears to diversify its offerings further. It gives consumers more choices.

Historically, GE Appliances also produced some Kenmore models. However, GE Appliances is now owned by Haier. The landscape of appliance manufacturing changes. New partnerships form over time. The key is that Sears consistently seeks out leading manufacturers. They do this to maintain the quality and variety of their Kenmore Elite line. Understanding this helps when you research your specific appliance. It confirms that Kenmore Elite products come from reputable sources.

## Identifying the Actual Manufacturer of Your Dishwasher

Determining the exact manufacturer of your Kenmore Elite dishwasher can be helpful. This information is useful for repairs, parts ordering, or even understanding features. The easiest way to identify the manufacturer is through the model number. Look for a sticker or plate on your dishwasher. It is usually found on the edge of the door, inside the door frame, or on the side of the tub. The model number often contains a prefix of three digits followed by a period. These three digits indicate the manufacturer code.

Here are some common manufacturer codes for Kenmore appliances:

*   **106, 110, 198, 665:** Often indicate Whirlpool manufacturing.
*   **795:** Generally points to LG Electronics.
*   **417:** Often signifies Electrolux (or formerly Frigidaire).
*   **363:** Could indicate General Electric (GE Appliances).

Once you have this prefix, you can cross-reference it with online databases. Many appliance parts websites also list these codes. This process removes the guesswork. You can then access specific repair guides or technical support. Knowing the original manufacturer helps ensure you get the correct parts. It also helps you understand the specific design philosophy behind your unit. This knowledge empowers you as a homeowner.

## What Makes Kenmore Elite Dishwashers Stand Out?

Kenmore Elite dishwashers are positioned as premium appliances. They offer a range of features designed for superior cleaning and convenience. These models often incorporate the best technologies from their original manufacturers. This makes them competitive with stand-alone brand names. They typically feature advanced washing cycles. These cycles can handle tough stains and delicate items. Many units also prioritize quiet operation.

One significant aspect is their interior design. Kenmore Elite dishwashers frequently include adjustable racks and specialized wash zones. This provides flexibility for various dish loads. Stainless steel tubs are also common. They help with durability and drying efficiency. Energy efficiency is another hallmark. Most Kenmore Elite models meet or exceed ENERGY STAR standards. This saves on utility costs.

Performance is a key differentiator. You can expect thorough cleaning and effective drying. This is due to powerful wash arms and heating elements. The "Elite" designation signifies these enhanced capabilities. These appliances aim to simplify your daily chores. They do so with robust construction and intelligent features. They strive to provide a top-tier dishwashing experience.

### Key Features Often Found in Kenmore Elite Dishwashers:

*   **Advanced Sensor Wash Cycles:** These cycles detect soil levels. They adjust water and temperature automatically.
*   **Quiet Operation:** Many models boast low decibel ratings. They operate almost silently.
*   **Flexible Racking Systems:** Adjustable racks, fold-down tines, and third racks optimize loading space.
*   **Powerful Drying Options:** Heated dry, fan-assist dry, or condensation dry ensure dishes are ready.
*   **Stainless Steel Tubs:** They provide durability and help improve drying performance.
*   **Water Filtration Systems:** Multi-stage filtration helps remove food particles. This keeps water clean for washing. Knowing [where the filter is in a Kenmore Elite dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-filter-in-a-kenmore-elite-dishwasher) is crucial for maintenance.

## Maintenance and Longevity of Kenmore Elite Dishwashers

Proper maintenance extends the life of any appliance, including Kenmore Elite dishwashers. Regular cleaning of the filter is essential. The filter traps food particles.

### Essential Maintenance Tips:

*   **Clean the Filter:** Remove and rinse the filter regularly. This prevents odors and improves wash quality. You can learn more about [how to remove Kenmore Elite dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-kenmore-elite-dishwasher-filter).

*   **Clean the Interior:** Wipe down the door gasket and interior walls. This removes grime and mold buildup.
*   **Run a Cleaning Cycle:** Use a dishwasher cleaner or vinegar solution. Run it on an empty hot water cycle. This helps remove hard water deposits and odors.
*   **Inspect Spray Arms:** Ensure spray arm holes are clear. Remove any debris blocking them.

Longevity also depends on the quality of the initial manufacturing. Since major brands like Whirlpool and LG make these units, they benefit from robust construction. However, even the best appliances need care. Addressing minor issues quickly can prevent larger problems. Following the manufacturer's guidelines for use and care is always best. This ensures your Kenmore Elite dishwasher serves you well for many years.
