SmartThings also offers routines. You can set your washing machine to start at a specific time. You can also link it with other smart devices. For example, lights could turn on when the wash finishes. This level of automation simplifies daily tasks. It makes your home work smarter for you.

## Step-by-Step Setup: Connecting Your Washer

Connecting your Samsung washing machine to the SmartThings app is a straightforward process. You need to prepare your machine and your app. First, ensure your washing machine is powered on. It must also have access to your home Wi-Fi network. This connection is vital for remote commands to reach your appliance.

### Initial Setup Steps

You must put your washing machine into pairing mode. Look for a "Smart Control" button or an equivalent option on the control panel. Press and hold this button until the Wi-Fi indicator blinks. This tells you the machine is ready to connect. Without this step, the app cannot find your washer.

Next, open the SmartThings app on your phone. Tap the plus sign (+) to add a new device. The app might automatically detect your washing machine. If not, you can manually select "Washing Machine" from the list of devices. Follow the on-screen prompts to proceed with the pairing. This typically involves selecting your Wi-Fi network and entering the password.

### Connecting to Wi-Fi

The app will then attempt to connect your washer to your Wi-Fi. This might take a few moments. Make sure your phone is close to the washing machine during this process. A strong Wi-Fi signal helps ensure a successful connection. Once connected, the Wi-Fi indicator on your washer will become solid. The SmartThings app will confirm the successful pairing.

After connecting, name your washing machine within the app. This helps identify it easily, especially if you have multiple smart appliances. You can assign it to a specific room in your SmartThings setup. This organization makes managing your smart home simpler. Now your Samsung washing machine is part of your smart home. You can start exploring its remote capabilities. Knowing how to [put your Samsung washing machine on spin only](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-samsung-washing-machine-on-spin-only) or other specific functions can also be managed through the app once connected.

Before you can start a cycle remotely, you must physically load the clothes. You also need to add detergent and fabric softener to the dispenser. The app cannot perform these physical actions. Once loaded, ensure the washer door is securely closed. If the door is open, the machine will not start. This is a safety feature common to all washing machines, including [how to start a Maytag washing machine top loader](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-start-maytag-washing-machine-top-loader) or any other brand.

This includes water temperature, spin speed, and rinse options. Make sure all your preferences are set before you proceed.

Before pressing start in the app, remember a few key things. You must have loaded the clothes into the drum. Detergent and fabric softener must be in their compartments. The washer door needs to be fully closed. If any of these conditions are not met, the machine will not start remotely. It will often send you a notification about the issue. This prevents problems like water leaks or incomplete washes. If your [Samsung washing machine is leaking from the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-washing-machine-leaking-from-the-bottom), app control will not resolve that underlying issue.

### Energy Savings and Monitoring

Many smart Samsung washing machines offer energy monitoring features. The SmartThings app can track your energy consumption for each wash cycle. This data helps you understand your appliance's usage. You can identify opportunities to save energy. For example, you might choose to run cycles during off-peak hours if your utility company offers time-of-use rates.

## Troubleshooting App Control Issues

While starting your Samsung washing machine from an app is convenient, you might encounter issues. Problems can arise from various sources. Understanding common troubleshooting steps helps resolve these quickly. Most issues relate to connectivity or machine readiness.

### Wi-Fi Connectivity Problems

The most common problem is a lost Wi-Fi connection. Your washing machine needs a stable Wi-Fi signal to communicate with the SmartThings app. First, check your home Wi-Fi network. Ensure your router is working correctly. Try restarting your router if other devices also have connection issues.

Next, verify the washer's Wi-Fi status. Look for the Wi-Fi indicator light on the machine's control panel. If it is off or blinking, the washer might have lost its connection. You might need to reconnect the washer to your Wi-Fi network through the SmartThings app. Follow the initial setup steps again. Make sure the washer is close enough to your router for a strong signal. If the signal is weak, consider a Wi-Fi extender.

Sometimes, a simple restart of the washing machine can fix connectivity. Unplug it from the power outlet for a minute. Then plug it back in. This can refresh its internal systems and re-establish a connection. You can also try restarting the SmartThings app on your phone. Close it completely and then reopen it.

### Washer Settings Issues

For remote start to work, the "Smart Control" feature must be enabled on your Samsung washing machine. This is usually a button or an option on the control panel. If this feature is not active, the app cannot send commands. The washer will not respond to remote requests. Make sure you press the "Smart Control" button each time you want to enable remote access. Some models require you to enable it every time you want to use the app to start a cycle.

The washer door must be completely closed and latched. If the door is even slightly ajar, the machine will not start. This is a crucial safety mechanism. Check the door and push it firmly shut. You might hear a click when it locks into place. If your washer's door is stuck or won't unlock, you may need to learn [how to get your Samsung washing machine to unlock](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-samsung-washing-machine-to-unlock) before it can start.

Also, ensure the washer is not in a paused or error state. If there is an error code on the display, you need to address it first. For example, if you find your [Miele washing machine will not start](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-will-my-miele-washing-machine-not-start), it might be due to a specific error code. The app will usually show you if the machine has a problem. Resolve the error before attempting remote start.

### Physical Obstacles

The washing machine needs detergent and laundry loaded inside. The app cannot add these for you. Double-check that you have loaded clothes. Ensure you have added the correct amount of detergent. If the machine senses no load, or insufficient detergent in some advanced models, it might not start.

If you have performed maintenance recently, like learning [how to clean your Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-samsung-washing-machine), ensure all components are back in place. For instance, the detergent drawer must be fully inserted. If your [Samsung washing machine drawer is out](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-samsung-washing-machine-drawer-out) or not properly seated, it could prevent the cycle from starting. Some models have sensors for this. Fixing these simple physical conditions can often resolve "not starting" issues quickly.

## Advanced SmartThings Washer Features

Adjust the water temperature, spin speed, and rinse options. This level of detail helps you care for different fabric types. It ensures optimal cleaning results for your specific load.

Some Samsung washing machines offer "Cycle Download" or "My Cycle" features. Through the app, you can download specialized wash cycles. These cycles might not be available on the machine's control panel. Examples include cycles for activewear, pet bedding, or specific stain removal. This expands the versatility of your washing machine. You can create a truly customized laundry experience. This is part of the modern way to [use a Samsung washing machine front loader](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-samsung-washing-machine-front-loader).

You can also save your favorite customized settings as presets in the app. This saves time for future washes. Instead of adjusting settings every time, you can select your saved preset. This ensures consistent results for frequently washed items. It simplifies the process for everyone in the household.

### Maintenance Alerts

The SmartThings app helps you maintain your washing machine. It can send you helpful alerts and reminders. For example, it might remind you to clean the drum. This prevents odors and ensures hygiene. It also suggests when to clean the lint filter if you have a combo unit. Regular maintenance extends your appliance's lifespan.

This helps you quickly diagnose and resolve minor issues. This reduces the need for service calls. It empowers you to keep your machine running smoothly.

For example, if your washer detects an unbalanced load, the app might notify you. It could suggest pausing the cycle to redistribute items. This prevents excessive vibration and potential damage. These proactive alerts make appliance ownership easier. They help you stay on top of maintenance tasks.

## Comparing Samsung's App Control with Other Brands
