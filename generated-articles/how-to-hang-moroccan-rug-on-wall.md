## How To Hang Moroccan Rug On Wall

Do you own a beautiful Moroccan rug? These unique pieces are not just for floors. Many people use them as wall art. Hanging a Moroccan rug transforms any room. It adds warmth, texture, and a global feel. This guide helps you hang your rug securely. We will cover preparation, different hanging methods, and care tips.

### Takeaway:

*   Choose a hanging method that protects your rug.
*   Prepare your rug and wall properly.
*   Gather the right tools before you start.
*   Maintain your wall-hung rug to keep it beautiful.

You can hang a Moroccan rug on a wall using several methods. The most common methods involve a fabric sleeve and a wooden dowel or Velcro strips. These approaches spread the rug's weight evenly. This prevents damage and keeps the rug flat against the wall.

### Why Hang a Moroccan Rug? Displaying Your Textile Art

Moroccan rugs are more than floor coverings. They are true works of art. Each rug tells a story through its patterns and colors. Hanging a Moroccan rug makes a strong visual statement. It becomes the focal point of a room. This use allows you to enjoy its beauty every day.

These rugs come in many styles. Beni Ourain rugs feature simple geometric designs. Azilal rugs use vibrant colors and abstract patterns. Boucherouite rugs are made from recycled fabrics. Each style offers a different aesthetic. When you hang them, their unique textures stand out. They add a layer of warmth and authenticity to your home decor.

Using a rug as wall art saves floor space. This is helpful in smaller rooms. It also protects the rug from foot traffic. This helps preserve its fibers and colors for a long time. Consider your rug's size and weight. A heavier rug needs a stronger hanging system. A light rug might work with simpler methods.

### Preparing Your Moroccan Rug for Wall Display

Before you hang your Moroccan rug, prepare it. Proper preparation ensures its beauty and longevity. Start by cleaning the rug. Even a new rug might have dust or loose fibers. A clean rug looks its best on the wall.

You can gently vacuum the rug. Use a low suction setting. For a deeper clean, consider professional cleaning. If you clean it yourself, use a mild soap meant for wool. Moroccan rugs are often made from wool. Always test cleaning solutions on a small, hidden area first. This checks for colorfastness. You can learn more about proper cleaning by reading [how to clean a wool rug](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-a-wool-rug).

Inspect the rug for any damage. Look for loose threads or worn spots. Repair these areas before hanging. This prevents further fraying or damage once it is on the wall. Make sure the rug lies flat. If it has creases, lay it flat on the floor for a few days. You can place weights on the corners to help flatten it.

Consider which side of the rug you want to display. Many Moroccan rugs have a distinct front and back. The front usually has a richer texture or clearer pattern. Position your rug to show off its best features. This step ensures your wall art looks perfect.

### Selecting the Best Hanging Method for Your Rug

Choosing the right hanging method is important. The method depends on the rug's size, weight, and value. It also depends on how much damage you can accept on your wall or rug. Some methods are more permanent. Others are easier to remove. I always recommend methods that protect the rug.

The fabric sleeve method is a popular choice. It involves sewing a sleeve onto the back of the rug. A rod slides through this sleeve. This distributes the rug's weight evenly across the top edge. It prevents sagging and strain on any single point. This method is good for heavy or valuable rugs. It offers strong support and keeps the rug straight.

Velcro is another option. One strip of Velcro attaches to the back of the rug. Another strip attaches to the wall. This method is less visible. It works well for lighter rugs. It also allows for easy removal and repositioning. Make sure to use industrial-strength Velcro for a secure hold. This helps prevent the rug from falling.

Clips or clamps are temporary solutions. They are not ideal for heavy rugs. They can cause damage over time. This is because they concentrate weight on small areas. A rod or dowel can also support the rug directly. This might work for smaller, lighter pieces. However, for larger pieces, sewing a sleeve is better. This ensures the rugâ€™s long-term preservation.

### Method 1: The Fabric Sleeve Approach (Most Recommended)

The fabric sleeve method is widely preferred for hanging rugs. It is safe for the rug and provides stable support. This method distributes the rug's weight across its entire top edge. This prevents stress on the fibers. It is perfect for both large and small Moroccan rugs.

**Steps to Install a Fabric Sleeve:**

1.  **Gather Materials:** You will need sturdy fabric, like canvas or heavy cotton. The fabric should be about 4-6 inches wide and the length of your rug's top edge. You also need a sewing machine, strong thread, and a wooden or metal dowel. The dowel should be slightly shorter than the rug's width. Wall brackets are also necessary.
2.  **Prepare the Sleeve:** Fold the fabric strip in half lengthwise. Iron it flat. This creates a strong, neat edge.
3.  **Attach to Rug:** Lay your rug face down on a clean surface. Place the folded fabric strip along the top edge of the rug. Position it about 1-2 inches from the top edge. Use pins to hold it in place. Ensure it is perfectly straight.
4.  **Sew the Sleeve:** Sew the fabric sleeve to the rug. Use strong thread. Sew along the top and bottom edges of the fabric strip. Make sure your stitches go through the rug's backing, but not through to the front. You want the stitches to be hidden from the front. If your rug has a loose weave, you may need to hand-stitch for more control.
5.  **Insert the Dowel:** Once sewn, you have a pocket. Slide the wooden or metal dowel through this sleeve. The dowel should fit snugly.
6.  **Mount the Dowel:** Install wall brackets on your chosen wall. Make sure they are level. The distance between the brackets should match the dowel's length. Place the dowel into the brackets. The rug will hang down from the dowel.

This method gives a clean, professional look. It also protects your rug from damage. I use this method for my most cherished textile pieces. It ensures they last for many years.

### Method 2: Velcro Strip System (Gentle and Adjustable)

The Velcro strip system offers flexibility. It is a good option for medium to light-weight Moroccan rugs. This method allows you to easily remove the rug for cleaning or repositioning. It is also less visible than a dowel system. You can achieve a very flat display with Velcro.

**Steps to Use a Velcro System:**

1.  **Select Velcro:** Buy a wide strip of industrial-strength hook-and-
