## LG Refrigerator Ice Maker: No Ice, Water Works?

Discovering your LG refrigerator is not making ice, but the water dispenser still works, can be confusing. Many homeowners face this exact issue. It suggests the problem is specific to the ice-making system, not the general water supply. I understand your frustration. My goal is to help you diagnose and fix this common appliance problem. This article explains the LG ice maker system. We will explore common reasons for ice maker failure. We will also provide clear steps to troubleshoot your unit. You will learn how to check the water filter, verify temperature settings, and inspect the ice maker assembly. We will also discuss when to seek professional help.

### Takeaway

*   **Verify Water Supply:** Ensure the water line to the ice maker is not kinked or frozen.
*   **Check Water Filter:** A clogged water filter restricts water flow to the ice maker.
*   **Inspect Ice Maker Arm/Sensor:** The ice maker may stop production if it senses a full bin.
*   **Confirm Freezer Temperature:** Temperatures above 0°F (-18°C) prevent proper ice formation.
*   **Reset Ice Maker:** Perform a simple reset to clear minor glitches.

If your LG refrigerator is not making ice but water works, the issue often stems from a clogged water filter, a frozen fill tube, a faulty ice maker mold thermostat, a malfunctioning ice maker assembly, or incorrect freezer temperature settings specific to the ice production system.

### Understanding Your LG Ice Maker System

Your LG refrigerator's ice maker is a complex system. It depends on several parts working together. Water flows from your home supply through a filter. Then it moves into the ice maker's fill tube. This tube directs water into the ice mold. A sensor detects when the mold is full. The water freezes in the mold. This freezing process takes time.

Once the water turns to solid ice, a heating element warms the mold slightly. This makes the ice cubes release. An ejector arm pushes the cubes out. They drop into the ice bin. A shut-off arm or optical sensor signals the ice maker. It stops production when the bin is full. If any part of this sequence fails, ice production stops. Water still flows to the dispenser because it bypasses the ice maker's specific water path and sensors. This explains why your water dispenser works. It uses a separate, more direct pathway from the filter to the front dispenser. Understanding these steps helps in troubleshooting.

Every component must function correctly. The water valve must open fully. The fill tube must be clear. The mold must heat and eject properly. The freezer temperature must be cold enough. A problem in any of these areas stops ice production. My LG refrigerator once had this exact issue. I traced the problem back to a clogged water filter. Replacing it fixed the problem quickly. It is good to learn these system basics. This knowledge helps you understand where to look for problems. It also makes you feel more confident in addressing the issue.

### Common Causes for No Ice Production

Many things can stop your LG refrigerator from making ice. Even if the water dispenser works. I have seen several common culprits. First, a clogged water filter restricts water flow to the ice maker. The water dispenser might still push water through. The ice maker needs a stronger, consistent flow. Second, a frozen fill tube is a frequent problem. Water enters the tube to fill the ice mold. If a small amount freezes in the tube, it blocks more water. This stops the ice maker from getting water.

Third, the ice maker shut-off arm or optical sensor might be faulty. The arm lifts or the sensor detects the ice bin. If it thinks the bin is full, it tells the ice maker to stop. This happens even if the bin is empty. Fourth, the freezer temperature might be too warm. Ice needs a very cold temperature to form. If the freezer is above 0°F (-18°C), ice won't freeze properly. The ice maker will not cycle. Finally, the ice maker assembly itself might be broken. This includes the motor, gears, or thermostat. Any of these parts can fail over time.

Each of these issues specifically impacts ice production. They do not affect the water dispenser. The dispenser uses a direct route from the filter to the spout. The ice maker has its own specific path and controls. This explains why you get water but no ice. Pinpointing the exact cause helps you focus your repair efforts.

### Initial Troubleshooting Steps for Your LG

When your LG refrigerator stops making ice, start with simple checks. These steps often resolve the issue. I always begin here. First, reset the ice maker. Locate the test button on your ice maker assembly. It is often a small red or black button. Press and hold it for a few seconds. This can clear minor electronic glitches. The ice maker might run a cycle. Check your refrigerator manual if you cannot find the button.

Second, ensure the ice maker is turned on. Some LG models have a switch on the ice maker or on the control panel. Make sure it is in the "on" position. Sometimes, it gets accidentally switched off. My kids once turned ours off while getting ice. Third, check for ice jams in the ice bucket or dispenser chute. Clear any clumped ice. Old ice can fuse together. This blocks new ice from forming or dispensing. Use a plastic utensil to gently break up ice.

Fourth, inspect the ice bin. Make sure it is correctly seated. If the bin is not properly aligned, the ice maker sensor might think it is missing or full. This prevents ice production. Lastly, look for any visible obstructions. Are there ice cubes stuck in the mold? Is anything blocking the ejector arm? Clear any blockages. These initial steps are quick. They require no tools. They often fix the problem without further effort.

### Checking Water Supply and Filtration

The water supply is crucial for ice production. If your LG refrigerator is not making ice, but water works, the problem might be here. The water filter is a common culprit. A clogged filter restricts water flow. While enough water might push through for the dispenser, the ice maker needs a strong, consistent flow. I always check this first. Locate your LG water filter. It is usually inside the refrigerator compartment or in the grille at the bottom. Replace it if it is old. Most manufacturers recommend changing filters every six months. You can often change an [LG refrigerator water filter without turning off water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-change-an-lg-refrigerator-water-filter-without-turning-off-water).

After the filter, check the water line. This line runs from your home's water supply to the refrigerator. It connects to a small valve on the back of the fridge. Inspect the line for kinks or bends. A kink restricts water flow. Trace the line carefully. Ensure it is not pinched behind the refrigerator. Also, check the fill tube. This is a narrow tube that brings water into the ice maker mold. It can freeze. If it freezes, water cannot enter the mold. Use a hairdryer on a low setting to gently melt any ice. Keep the dryer moving to prevent plastic damage.

The water inlet valve could also be faulty. This valve controls water flow into the ice maker. It is an electromagnetic valve. If it fails, it won't open to allow water in. This is a less common issue. It usually requires professional diagnosis. Make sure the water supply to the house is on. Confirm the saddle valve on your copper water line is open. These simple checks on the water supply and filter often reveal the issue. Maintaining your [refrigerator ice maker water line](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-refrigerator-ice-maker-water-line) is vital for consistent ice.

### Addressing Temperature and Control Settings

The freezer temperature directly affects ice production. If your LG refrigerator is not making ice, but water works, confirm the freezer setting. Ice needs a temperature of 0°F (-18°C) or lower to freeze properly. If your freezer is set too warm, or if there is a temperature fluctuation, water will not freeze into solid cubes. The ice maker will not cycle. Use a thermometer to verify the actual temperature inside your freezer. Adjust the thermostat if needed. Give the refrigerator several hours to reach the new temperature.

Next, check for any special ice maker settings on your LG control panel. Some LG models have an "Ice Plus" or "Fast Freeze" option. Activating this setting temporarily lowers the freezer temperature. It speeds up ice production. If this setting is off, or if it was accidentally deactivated, it might slow down or stop ice making. Ensure it is enabled if you want faster ice. Also, look for a "lock" feature on the control panel. If the panel is locked, you cannot change settings. Unlock it before making adjustments.

Ensure nothing blocks the freezer vents. Blocked vents can lead to uneven cooling. This results in warm spots, especially around the ice maker. Rearrange items in your freezer for proper airflow. Overfilling the freezer can also hinder air circulation. Make sure the freezer door seals properly. A faulty door seal lets warm air in. This raises the internal temperature. Test the seal by closing the door on a dollar bill. If you can pull the bill out easily, the seal might need replacement. Proper temperature and settings are fundamental for consistent ice making.

### Inspecting the Ice Maker Assembly

If water supply and temperature are fine, the ice maker assembly might be the problem. Your LG refrigerator's ice maker is a mechanical and electrical unit. Many issues can arise here. First, examine the ice mold. Is there a layer of frost or ice built up in the mold or around the ejector arms? This can prevent new water from filling or existing ice from ejecting. Use a plastic utensil to gently scrape away any excess ice. You can also carefully use a hairdryer on a low setting. Direct the warm air at the mold to melt frost. Do not overheat the plastic.

Next, check the ice maker's shut-off arm or optical sensors. Many LG models use an optical sensor to detect ice levels. These are small infrared beams located on the side of the ice maker unit and the ice bucket. If dust, debris, or a stray ice cube blocks the beam, the ice maker thinks the bin is full. It stops production. Carefully wipe the lenses of the sensors with a soft cloth. Ensure nothing obstructs their view. If your model has a metal shut-off arm, make sure it moves freely. It should not be bent or stuck in the "up" position.

Finally, consider the ice maker motor or thermostat. The motor drives the ejector arms. If you hear no sounds or see no movement after resetting, the motor might be faulty. The thermostat in the ice maker mold senses when water is frozen. If this thermostat fails, the ice maker won't know when to cycle. These parts are more complex to test. They often require a multimeter. If you suspect these components, it might be time for a professional. Sometimes, replacing the entire ice maker assembly is the easiest solution. Many people choose to [clean refrigerator ice maker](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-refrigerator-ice-maker) components as part of maintenance.

### When to Call a Professional for LG Ice Maker Issues

You have followed all the troubleshooting steps. Your LG refrigerator is still not making ice, but water works. At this point, it is wise to consider calling a professional appliance technician. Some problems are complex. They require specialized tools or knowledge. I know the feeling of hitting a wall during a DIY repair. It is good to know when to ask for help.

Here are situations where a professional is best:
