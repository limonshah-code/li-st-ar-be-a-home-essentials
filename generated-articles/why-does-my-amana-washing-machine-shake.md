## Why Does My Amana Washing Machine Shake

Imagine this: you start a laundry load, and moments later, your entire house begins to rumble. Your Amana washing machine shakes, vibrates, and might even walk across the floor. This is a common and frustrating problem for many homeowners. A noisy, vibrating washer is not just an annoyance; it signals that something is wrong.

I understand how concerning it feels when your reliable appliance starts acting up. An Amana washing machine shake can stem from several issues, from simple fixes you can handle yourself to more serious mechanical problems requiring expert attention. In this article, I will explore the main reasons why your Amana washer shakes. I will also provide clear steps you can take to diagnose and resolve these issues. My goal is to help you restore peace and quiet to your laundry routine.

### Takeaway

If your Amana washing machine shakes, address the issue quickly. Simple steps often solve the problem.

*   Check if the machine is level on the floor.
*   Ensure laundry loads are balanced inside the drum.
*   Inspect internal parts like shock absorbers or suspension rods.
*   Clean the drain filter to prevent water flow issues.
*   Consider professional help for complex mechanical failures.

### Answer to the Main Query

Your Amana washing machine likely shakes due to an imbalance. This imbalance can come from an unlevel machine, an unevenly distributed laundry load, or worn internal components like shock absorbers or suspension rods. Drainage issues or a clogged filter can also cause excessive vibration during the spin cycle.

### The Foundation: Ensuring Your Amana Washing Machine is Level

One of the most frequent reasons your Amana washing machine shakes is an unlevel setup. A washing machine needs to sit perfectly flat on the floor. If it does not, the spinning drum creates strong vibrations. These vibrations then transfer to the machine's body and the floor.

### Checking the Installation Site

First, check the floor where your Amana washer sits. Is it sturdy and even? Sometimes, a weak floor structure can contribute to vibrations, even if the machine itself is level. You want to make sure the machine has a solid base. If your laundry area has a flexible or warped floor, it can worsen shaking.

Next, try to rock your Amana washing machine. Push on different corners. If the machine wobbles, it is not level. A simple spirit level tool can confirm this. Place the level on top of the washer, from front to back and side to side. Small differences in height become very clear with this tool.

### Adjusting the Leveling Legs

Every Amana washing machine has adjustable leveling legs. These are usually found at the bottom corners of the unit. You can turn these legs clockwise or counter-clockwise to raise or lower each corner. Most machines require you to tilt the washer back or lift a corner slightly to access the legs. Some models may have a locking nut that you must loosen first.

Carefully adjust each leg until the machine is stable and does not wobble. Check the level again after each adjustment. This process takes patience, but it is crucial for a smooth operation. Make sure all four legs make firm contact with the floor. Proper leveling significantly reduces vibrations.

Ensuring your machine is level is a fundamental step in appliance care.

### Unbalanced Loads: The Most Common Culprit for Washer Shakes

An unbalanced load is probably the most common reason your Amana washing machine shakes. When clothes clump together on one side of the drum, it creates an uneven weight distribution. During the spin cycle, this uneven weight causes the drum to spin erratically. This erratic spin then causes violent shaking and banging noises.

### Overloading Your Amana Washer

Many people fill their washing machines to the brim. Overloading is a big mistake. A drum packed with too many clothes does not allow items to move freely. This prevents proper distribution during the wash and rinse cycles. The result is a heavy, dense clump of wet laundry that gets thrown around during the spin.

Always leave enough space in the drum for clothes to tumble. This allows water to circulate better and helps distribute the load. A good rule is to fill the drum about three-quarters full. This leaves room for the clothes to expand and move. Overloading stresses the motor and suspension, too.

### Underloading and Small Items

While overloading is bad, underloading can also cause problems. Washing just one or two heavy items, like a large blanket or a single pair of jeans, can create an unbalanced load. These items may stick to one side of the drum. This makes the machine struggle to balance itself.

Small, very absorbent items can also cause issues. A single heavy towel or a small rug can absorb a lot of water. If it spins alone, it can cling to the drum wall and create an imbalance. Try to wash these items with a few other medium-sized items. This helps distribute the weight evenly.

### Distributing Laundry Evenly

Before starting a cycle, take a moment to arrange your clothes.

*   **Mix items:** Combine large and small items. For example, wash a large towel with several smaller shirts. This helps fill the drum space more evenly.
*   **Avoid single heavy items:** Do not wash one large, heavy item by itself. If you must, add a few other items of similar size or weight to balance it out.
*   **Unbundle clothes:** If you have items like sheets or duvet covers that tend to bundle up, pause the cycle during the wash. Open the lid or door and redistribute the items. This prevents them from forming a heavy ball.
*   **Check pockets:** Remove all items from pockets. Coins, keys, or small heavy objects can shift weight unexpectedly. This also protects your machine from damage.

Proper load management is simple. It makes a big difference in preventing an Amana washing machine shake. It also extends the life of your appliance.

### Worn or Damaged Components: When Parts Need Attention

If your Amana washing machine shakes even with a level machine and balanced loads, internal components might be the problem. Over time, parts inside the washer can wear out or break. These parts are responsible for dampening vibrations and supporting the drum. When they fail, the machine loses its stability during operation.

### Inspecting Shock Absorbers and Suspension Rods

Most modern washing machines, especially front-loaders, use shock absorbers. Top-loaders often use suspension rods and springs. These components absorb the energy from the spinning drum. They prevent excessive shaking. If a shock absorber leaks fluid or a suspension rod breaks, it cannot do its job. The drum will then move erratically.

You can often inspect these parts. For top-loaders, you might need to remove the outer casing. Look for bent or broken rods, or springs that are no longer firm. For front-loaders, you may need to access the bottom or rear of the machine. Look for oil leaks from the shocks or signs of wear. Replacing these parts can make a huge difference.

### Checking Drum Bearings and Drive Belts

The drum spins on bearings. If these bearings wear out, the drum can wobble instead of spinning smoothly. A bad bearing often creates a loud grinding or roaring noise, especially during the spin cycle. The shaking will become more severe as the bearing deteriorates. Replacing drum bearings is a more complex repair. It often requires dismantling the washer significantly.

Drive belts also play a role. These belts connect the motor to the drum. If a belt is stretched, frayed, or broken, it can cause the drum to spin inconsistently. This leads to vibration. Check the belt for signs of wear. A loose belt can slip, causing uneven rotation and noise. A new belt can restore smooth operation.

### Motor Mounts and Pulleys

The motor itself can cause shaking if its mounts are loose or broken. Motor mounts hold the motor in place. If they fail, the motor moves excessively, causing vibrations that spread to the entire machine. Pulleys also need to be secure and straight. A bent or wobbly pulley can throw off the drum's balance.

Inspecting these parts requires some mechanical knowledge. You might need to tilt the machine or remove panels to get a good view. Always unplug the washer before starting any internal inspection or repair. Taking a [do-it-yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) approach can save money. However, if you are unsure about handling internal components, calling a professional is best. These parts are critical for safe and effective washer operation.

### Drainage and Pump Issues: Hidden Causes of Amana Washer Vibrations

While less obvious, problems with your Amana washing machine's drainage system can also lead to excessive shaking. If water does not drain properly, it can remain in the drum. This adds significant weight to the load. This extra water creates an imbalance during the spin cycle, causing the machine to shake violently.

### Clogged Drain Pump Filter

Your Amana washing machine has a drain pump filter. This filter catches lint, coins, and other small debris. Over time, this filter can become clogged. A clogged filter restricts water flow. This means the machine cannot pump water out efficiently. If water stays in the drum during the spin cycle, it adds weight. This causes the drum to spin off-balance, leading to shaking.

Many Amana models have an accessible drain pump filter, often located behind a small panel at the bottom front of the machine. You will need a shallow pan to catch any water that drains out when you open it. Twist the filter counter-clockwise to remove it. Clean it thoroughly under running water, removing all debris. Then, replace it securely. Regularly cleaning this filter is a simple yet effective maintenance task. For specific steps on cleaning this part, review guides on [how to clean washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-filter).

### Restricted Drain Hose

The drain hose carries water from the washing machine to your home's drainage system. If this hose becomes kinked, bent, or obstructed, water cannot flow freely. This issue is similar to a clogged filter. Water remains in the drum. This makes the machine shake during the spin cycle.

Check the drain hose for any kinks or bends. Make sure it is not pressed against a wall or other objects. You should also ensure the hose is not pushed too far down into the drain pipe. This can create a siphon effect, causing problems. Sometimes, debris can build up inside the hose itself. You may need to remove the hose and flush it with water to clear any blockages.

### Pump Malfunctions

The drain pump itself can fail. If the pump is not working correctly, it cannot remove water from the drum. You might hear the pump humming but see no water draining. This indicates a problem with the pump motor or impeller. A failing pump leads to standing water. This water then makes your Amana washing machine shake during the spin cycle.

Diagnosing a bad pump might require testing it with a multimeter. This is often a job for a professional. Replacing a drain pump involves disconnecting hoses and electrical wiring. Proper drainage is essential for your washer's performance. It also prevents mold and mildew. Keep your Amana washing machine clean overall by following guides like [how to clean your washing machine inside](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-washing-machine-inside). This helps ensure all components, including the pump, function effectively.

### Addressing Specific Amana Washer Designs: Top-Loaders vs. Front-Loaders

The design of your Amana washing machine impacts why it might shake. Top-loaders and front-loaders have different internal mechanisms. These differences can lead to unique shaking issues. Understanding your specific model helps with troubleshooting.

### Top-Load Amana Washers and Agitator Balance

Top-load Amana washing machines typically have a central agitator or an impeller at the bottom of the tub. Their design often uses suspension rods or springs to support the wash tub. When a top-loader shakes, it often relates to an unbalanced load around the agitator. Clothes can wrap tightly around the agitator, creating a heavy side. This then throws the entire tub off balance during the spin.

If you have an Amana top-loader, always distribute clothes evenly around the agitator. Do not pile everything on one side. Small, heavy items, like sneakers, are common culprits for unbalancing top-loaders. Consider washing very bulky items like comforters separately. If suspension rods are worn, the tub will sag or feel loose. This leads to severe shaking. For specific maintenance steps for your top-loader, you might find guides like [how to clean washing machine top-loader](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-top-loader) helpful, as a clean machine runs smoother.

### Front-Load Amana Washers and Tub Support

Front-load Amana washing machines use a horizontal drum. They typically rely on a system of shock absorbers and springs for suspension. These components absorb vibrations from the spinning drum. Front-loaders often shake more violently than top-loaders if they are not perfectly level. The high spin speeds mean any imbalance is greatly amplified.

With front-loaders, worn shock absorbers are a very common cause of shaking. You might hear a thumping noise as the drum moves up and down during the spin. Another unique issue for front-loaders is drum bearing failure. If the bearings that support the drum shaft wear out, the drum will wobble. This causes loud noises and significant shaking. Checking the rubber door gasket for signs of wear can also be useful, as a damaged gasket might sometimes contribute to minor imbalance or leaks which can then impact operation.

Regardless of your Amana washer type, maintaining balance and checking component integrity are key. The high spin speeds of modern washers make perfect balance essential. Even minor issues can cause major shaking.

### Routine Maintenance for a Quiet Amana Washing Machine

Regular maintenance can prevent your Amana washing machine from shaking. It also extends the appliance's lifespan. Small, consistent efforts make a big difference. Ignoring maintenance can lead to bigger, more expensive problems down the line.

### Regular Cleaning Practices

A clean washing machine runs more efficiently. Dirt, detergent residue, and mold can build up inside the drum and other components. This buildup can add weight to the drum. It can also create friction. This leads to unbalanced spinning and shaking.

*   **Run monthly cleaning cycles:** Use a washing machine cleaner, white vinegar, or baking soda. Run an empty hot water cycle. This helps flush out residue and odors.
*   **Wipe down the drum and dispenser:** After each use, wipe the inside of the drum. Clean the detergent dispenser drawer. This prevents buildup.
*   **Clean the pump filter:** As discussed, a clogged pump filter can cause water retention. Clean it every few months, or more often if you wash pet hair or lint-heavy items. This ensures proper drainage.
*   **Check and clean the door gasket:** For front-loaders, wipe the rubber seal around the door. Mold and grime can build up here. This keeps the seal flexible and prevents issues.

These simple cleaning steps help maintain the internal balance of the machine. They also improve its overall performance. A clean washer is less likely to shake.

### Periodic Component Checks

Beyond cleaning, periodically check the physical components of your Amana washing machine. This helps catch problems before they become severe.

*   **Test for levelness:** Use a spirit level every few months. Re-adjust the leveling legs if needed. Even slight shifts in the floor can make the machine go off-level over time.
*   **Inspect hoses:** Check inlet and drain hoses for kinks, bulges, or leaks. Ensure they are securely connected. A kinked hose can impede water flow, affecting balance.
*   **Listen for unusual noises:** Pay attention to any new sounds during wash or spin cycles. Grinding, squealing, or thumping noises often indicate a problem with bearings, belts, or the motor.
*   **Examine visible parts:** If you are comfortable, look at the drive belt, motor, and suspension components. Look for signs of wear, cracks, or looseness. Tighten any loose screws or bolts you can safely access.

Taking a proactive approach to maintenance can save you from the headache of an Amana washing machine shake. It ensures your appliance remains a quiet and reliable helper in your home.
