Few things disrupt a kitchen's rhythm like a faulty dishwasher. If your KitchenAid dishwasher experiences issues such as improper filling, continuous draining, or even overflowing, a failing float switch is often the culprit. This small but vital component monitors the water level inside the appliance. Replacing it yourself can save you time and money, and it is a task many homeowners can complete with some guidance. I know the frustration of a dishwasher not doing its job, and I am here to help you fix it.

This guide provides clear, precise instructions on how to replace a KitchenAid dishwasher float switch. We will cover identifying the problem, gathering tools, ensuring safety, and performing the replacement step-by-step. By the end, you will feel confident tackling this common appliance repair. Let's get your KitchenAid dishwasher running perfectly again.

### Takeaway

Replacing your KitchenAid dishwasher float switch can resolve water level issues and prevent leaks.

### Understanding Your KitchenAid Dishwasher's Float Switch

The float switch is a critical safety and operational component in your KitchenAid dishwasher. It acts as a water level sensor. This device ensures the dishwasher fills with the correct amount of water for each cycle. It also prevents overfilling, which could cause a damaging flood. Think of it as your dishwasher's personal lifeguard.

When water enters the dishwasher tub, it lifts a plastic float located at the bottom. This float then activates the float switch. If the water reaches a predetermined level, the switch signals the control board to stop the water inlet valve. This prevents too much water from entering the machine. If the float switch fails, your dishwasher might not fill at all, or it might overfill and leak. It is a simple mechanism with a big job.

A faulty float switch can manifest in several ways. You might notice your dishwasher refusing to start a cycle because it thinks it has too much or too little water. It might also begin filling and never stop, leading to water overflowing onto your kitchen floor. Another common symptom is the dishwasher filling, draining, and refilling repeatedly, never truly getting through its wash cycle. Sometimes, you might even see water sitting in the bottom of your dishwasher, which could be a sign the float switch is stuck or faulty. Knowing these signs helps you diagnose the problem accurately.

Understanding the float switch's role helps pinpoint if it is the source of your dishwasher's trouble. If your KitchenAid dishwasher has water in the bottom, a faulty float switch is a strong possibility, among other potential issues. Diagnosing this part early can save you from complex repairs later. It is a relatively inexpensive part, making it a good starting point for troubleshooting water-related problems.

### Tools and Parts for Float Switch Replacement

Before you start any repair, gathering the right tools and parts saves time and prevents frustration. For this specific task, you will need a few common items. Having everything ready before you begin makes the replacement process smooth. I always make a checklist to ensure I have everything, and I recommend you do the same.

First, you need the new KitchenAid dishwasher float switch. Dishwasher models vary, and so do their components. Always obtain the correct part number for your specific KitchenAid dishwasher model. You can usually find the model number inside the dishwasher door on a sticker. Using an incorrect part can lead to future failures or damage to your appliance. You can usually find parts online through appliance parts retailers by searching your model number.

For tools, you will need basic hand tools. A Phillips head screwdriver and a flathead screwdriver are essential for removing panels and sometimes for prying clips. You might also need a nut driver or a small wrench set, depending on how the float switch is secured. Some models use a retaining nut or screws. Pliers, especially needle-nose pliers, are useful for disconnecting wires or hose clamps.

Safety equipment is also important. Always wear work gloves to protect your hands from sharp edges or grime. Safety glasses are a good idea, especially when working with water or tight spaces where debris might fall. You should also have towels or rags ready to soak up any residual water inside the dishwasher or in the drain pan. A headlamp or flashlight can be helpful for illuminating dark areas under the dishwasher. Preparing properly ensures your safety and efficiency.

### Safety First: Preparing for Your Dishwasher Repair

Safety is the most important step before starting any appliance repair. Working with electricity and water presents significant hazards if proper precautions are not taken. Neglecting safety steps can result in electric shock, water damage, or personal injury. I always take a moment to ensure all power and water sources are completely off. This gives me peace of mind to focus on the repair itself.

The first crucial step is to disconnect the dishwasher's power supply. Do not just turn off the dishwasher. You must locate the circuit breaker that controls the dishwasher and switch it to the "off" position. If you are unsure which breaker it is, switch off the main breaker for your home. You can also unplug the dishwasher from its wall outlet if it is accessible. Always double-check that the power is off by trying to turn the dishwasher on. No power means you are safe from electrical shock.

Next, you need to turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. Look for the shut-off valve, which is usually located under the kitchen sink, near the hot water line connected to the dishwasher. Turn the handle clockwise until it is completely off. If there is no dedicated shut-off valve for the dishwasher, you may need to turn off the main water supply to your house. This prevents water from leaking out during the repair process.

After disconnecting power and water, drain any residual water from the dishwasher tub. You can do this by running a drain cycle if the dishwasher still has power. Otherwise, you may need to manually scoop out the water or use a wet/dry vacuum. Placing towels around the base of the dishwasher helps catch any spills during the repair. Taking these simple safety measures makes the entire repair process much safer and less stressful. This preparation also protects your home from potential water damage.

### Accessing the Float Switch on Your KitchenAid Dishwasher

Accessing the float switch is often the trickiest part of the repair. The exact method varies slightly between KitchenAid dishwasher models. However, the general process involves either accessing it from inside the dishwasher tub or from the bottom of the appliance. Understanding your model's design will guide your approach. I find it helpful to look up a parts diagram for my specific model online before I start.

For many KitchenAid models, the float switch is located at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, usually underneath a removable spray arm and filter assembly. You will first need to open the dishwasher door completely. Then, remove the bottom dish rack to provide clear access to the tub floor. Locate the lower spray arm and its mounting nut or cap. Unscrew or unclip it to remove the spray arm. Next, you will likely need to remove the filter assembly. This typically involves twisting and lifting components like the coarse filter and fine filter screen.

Once the filter assembly is clear, you can often see the float cup or stem protruding from the tub floor. The actual float switch mechanism, however, is usually located directly underneath this float, in the lower access pan of the dishwasher. This means you will need to pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet recess to access the bottom. Carefully disconnect the drain hose and water supply line from their connections. You may also need to remove the electrical junction box cover and disconnect the power wires.

After disconnecting everything, carefully slide the dishwasher out from its cabinet. Be gentle to avoid scratching your floor or damaging the hoses. Once it is out, you can gently tip the dishwasher onto its back or side to access the bottom pan. Make sure to place towels or cardboard underneath to protect the floor and the dishwasher itself. You will then see the components mounted to the underside of the tub, including the float switch. Comparing this process to how you might [remove a GE dishwasher flood float](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-ge-dishwasher-flood-float) shows similar principles for accessing the part.

### Removing the Old KitchenAid Dishwasher Float Switch

With the dishwasher safely on its back or side, you can now clearly see the components on the underside of the tub. The float switch will be visible from here, typically mounted directly below where the float stem protrudes inside the tub. It often looks like a small plastic housing with wires connected to it. Take a moment to observe how it is installed. This helps with the reinstallation process.

The float switch assembly usually consists of two parts: the float cup or stem that extends into the tub, and the switch mechanism itself, which is located underneath the tub. The switch mechanism typically has electrical wires connected to it. Before disconnecting anything, take a picture of the wiring. This ensures you reconnect the new switch correctly. Wire colors and positions are important.

To remove the old switch, you first need to disconnect the electrical wires. These are usually push-on terminals. Gently pull them off the terminals, being careful not to tug on the wires themselves. If they are stiff, you can use needle-nose pliers to carefully wiggle them off. Make sure the wire insulation is not damaged.

Next, you must release the switch from its mounting. This can vary by model. Some KitchenAid float switches are held in place by a retaining nut that you can unscrew from the bottom side of the tub. Others might have plastic tabs or clips that you need to squeeze or pry to release the switch. Use your screwdriver or pliers as needed. Once the switch is loose, carefully pull it away from the tub. The float assembly might come out with it, or it might need to be removed from the inside of the tub after the bottom switch is detached. Ensure all parts of the old switch and float are removed before proceeding.

### Installing the New KitchenAid Dishwasher Float Switch

Now that the old float switch is out, installing the new one is generally a reverse of the removal process. This step requires careful attention to detail. Ensure your new float switch is the exact replacement part for your KitchenAid dishwasher model. Using the correct part guarantees compatibility and proper function. I always double-check the part numbers before unwrapping the new component.

First, position the new float switch assembly. If your model has a separate float cup and switch, make sure the float cup is correctly seated in its opening inside the tub. Then, align the switch mechanism underneath the tub, connecting to the float stem. Ensure the switch body aligns with any mounting holes or slots. It should sit flush against the bottom of the tub.

Next, secure the float switch in place. If it uses a retaining nut, thread it onto the stem from the bottom side of the tub and tighten it gently with a wrench or nut driver. Do not overtighten, as this can crack the plastic. If your switch uses clips or tabs, push the switch firmly into place until it clicks or locks. Ensure it feels secure and does not wobble.

Finally, reconnect the electrical wires to the new float switch. Refer to the picture you took earlier, or consult your dishwasher's wiring diagram if available. Push the wire terminals firmly onto the corresponding prongs on the new switch. Ensure each connection is snug and secure. Loose connections can lead to intermittent issues or prevent the switch from working at all. Once the wires are connected and the switch is secure, you are ready for reassembly.

### Testing and Finalizing Your KitchenAid Dishwasher Repair

After installing the new float switch, the final steps involve reassembling your KitchenAid dishwasher and testing it to ensure everything works correctly. This is where your careful work pays off. I always feel a sense of accomplishment at this stage, knowing the repair is almost complete. It is important not to rush the reassembly process.

First, carefully slide the dishwasher back into its cabinet opening. Be mindful of the water supply line, drain hose, and electrical cord. Ensure they do not get pinched or kinked as you push the dishwasher back into place. Reconnect the electrical wires in the junction box, if you disconnected them there, and secure the cover. Reattach the water supply line to the inlet valve and the drain hose to the sink drain or garbage disposal connection. Make sure all hose clamps and nuts are tight to prevent leaks. If you suspect issues with water filling, you might also want to inspect your [KitchenAid dishwasher water inlet valve](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-kitchenaid-dishwasher-water-inlet-valve) at this time, though it is a separate repair.

Once the dishwasher is fully reconnected and back in position, turn the water supply back on. Then, go to your circuit breaker panel and switch the dishwasher's power back on. Before running a full wash cycle, it is a good idea to perform a quick test. Open the dishwasher door and manually lift the float stem. You should hear a click from the float switch as it activates. This confirms the physical mechanism is working.

Now, close the door and start a short wash cycle. Stand by the dishwasher during the initial fill to observe its operation. Check for any leaks around the water inlet valve, drain hose, or underneath the appliance. The dishwasher should fill with the correct amount of water and then proceed through its cycle without overfilling or stopping prematurely. If the dishwasher still exhibits problems, or if you still find water at the bottom, consider further troubleshooting, possibly checking the control board if other components are fine.
