## Finding the MAC Address on Your LG Dryer's Physical Label

Sometimes, the LG ThinQ app might not work. Or your dryer might not be connected to Wi-Fi yet. In these cases, you can find the MAC address directly on the appliance. LG places important information on physical labels. These labels are usually stickers. They contain details like the model number and serial number. The MAC address is often found there too.

You need to check a few specific spots on your LG dryer. Start by looking at the back of the dryer. Many manufacturers place these labels on the rear panel.

## Accessing Your Router Settings to Discover Your LG Dryer's MAC Address

If the app and physical label methods do not work, your router can help. Your home router manages all network traffic. It keeps a record of every device connected to it. This record includes their MAC addresses. This method is a bit more technical. But it is very effective. It is especially useful if your dryer is already connected.

You will need to access your router's administration page. Open a web browser on a computer or phone connected to your home network. Type your router's IP address into the address bar. Common IP addresses are `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`. You can usually find your router's IP address on a sticker on the router itself. It might also be in your router's manual. You will then need to log in. Use your router's username and password. If you have not changed them, they might be "admin/admin" or similar default credentials.

Once logged in, look for a section like "Connected Devices," "DHCP Client List," "Attached Devices," or "Network Map." The exact name varies by router brand. In this list, you will see all devices currently connected to your Wi-Fi. Look for a device name that resembles your LG dryer. It might appear as "LG_Dryer," "SmartAppliance," or a generic hostname. Next to each device name, you will find its IP address and its MAC address. Locate your dryer's entry. Note down its MAC address. This method is a reliable way to get the MAC address. It works even if the dryer's physical label is hard to read or missing. Remember to save your router settings if you change anything. It also helps to keep your router firmware updated for best performance.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues When Finding Your LG Dryer MAC Address

Sometimes, finding your LG dryer's MAC address can be tricky. You might run into problems. I have experienced situations where the app did not show the information. Or I could not find the label. Do not worry. There are solutions for common issues.

One frequent problem is the dryer not appearing in the ThinQ app. First, check if your dryer is powered on. Make sure it is connected to your Wi-Fi network. You can try power cycling the dryer. Unplug it for a minute, then plug it back in. This can refresh its network connection. Also, ensure your smartphone is on the same Wi-Fi network as the dryer. If the app still does not show the MAC address, try reconnecting the dryer to Wi-Fi through the app's setup process. This might reveal the network details.

If your dryer is not showing up in your router's connected devices list, ensure it is online. Also, confirm it is connected to your Wi-Fi. Sometimes, Wi-Fi signal strength can be an issue. Move your dryer closer to the router temporarily if possible. You can also try restarting your router. This often resolves minor network glitches. If your LG dryer is experiencing other issues, like [why is my LG dryer so loud](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dryer-so-loud), it might indicate a different kind of problem.
