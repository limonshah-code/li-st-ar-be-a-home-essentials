## The Carpet Installation Process: Step-by-Step with Don Hobbs

Installing new carpet involves several steps. Each step is important for a good outcome. Don Hobbs follows a clear process to ensure quality. Understanding these steps helps you prepare. We make the process smooth for you.

### Initial Consultation and Measurement

The first step is a consultation. We discuss your needs and preferences. We help you choose the right carpet type. Then, we take precise measurements of your rooms. Accurate measurements prevent waste and ensure we order the correct amount of carpet and underlay.

### Subfloor Preparation

Next, we prepare the subfloor. The subfloor must be clean, dry, and smooth. We remove any old flooring. This includes old carpet and underlay. We fix any loose floorboards. We also address any uneven spots. A good subfloor is essential for a flat carpet finish. Sometimes, you might ask, [would you paint floor before carpet laying](https://homeessentialsguide.com/would-you-paint-floor-before-carpet-laying)? We can advise on such preparations. For existing carpet removal, you might wonder [how much for carpet removal service](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-for-carpet-removal-service). We offer clear pricing for this.

### Underlay and Gripper Rods

We install underlay next. Underlay adds comfort and insulation. It also extends the life of your carpet. Gripper rods go around the room's edges. These rods hold the carpet in place. We make sure they are securely fastened. This is a key part of the installation process.

### Carpet Laying and Finishing

Finally, we lay the carpet. Our team cuts the carpet to size. We then stretch it across the room. We secure it onto the gripper rods. This process makes the carpet tight and wrinkle-free. We trim excess carpet. We join seams carefully for a seamless look. After installation, you might ask, [can you walk on carpet after installation](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-walk-on-carpet-after-installation)? We will give you clear instructions.
