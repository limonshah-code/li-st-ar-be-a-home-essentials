### Takeaway

*   **Clean Dryer Vents Regularly:** A clogged vent is a top cause of overheating.
*   **Check Heating Elements and Thermostats:** These parts control heat and can fail.
*   **Inspect Moisture Sensors:** Faulty sensors can lead to over-drying.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Give clothes room to tumble and dry evenly.
*   **Use Correct Settings:** Match heat and cycle to fabric types.

Your LG dryer might burn clothes due to issues like clogged dryer vents, a malfunctioning heating element, faulty thermostats, or incorrect moisture sensors. Overloading the dryer or using excessively high heat settings can also cause fabrics to scorch. These problems often lead to overheating, which damages clothes and poses a fire risk.

### Clogged Dryer Vents: A Major Fire Hazard

One of the most common and dangerous reasons your LG dryer burns clothes is a clogged dryer vent. Over time, lint, debris, and even small articles of clothing can accumulate in the dryer vent system. This buildup restricts airflow, which is critical for your dryer to operate safely and efficiently. When airflow is blocked, hot air cannot escape the dryer drum properly.

The trapped hot air causes the dryer's internal temperature to rise excessively. This excessive heat directly impacts your clothes, leading to scorching or burning. A clogged vent also forces the heating element to work harder, increasing the risk of overheating. This situation is extremely dangerous and can lead to a house fire. Regular vent cleaning is vital for both dryer performance and home safety. You can learn more about proper cleaning methods in our guide on [how to clean your dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-dryer).

*   **Reduced Airflow:** Lint blocks the path for hot air to exit the dryer.
*   **Trapped Heat:** Hot air stays inside the drum, raising temperatures beyond safe levels.
*   **Overworked Components:** The dryer's heating element and motor work harder, increasing wear and tear.
*   **Fire Risk:** Lint is highly flammable; extreme heat can ignite it, causing a fire.

To prevent this, I always recommend checking your lint trap before every load. You should also clean the entire dryer vent system at least once a year, or more often if you use your dryer frequently. This includes the ductwork leading from the dryer to the outside of your home. A clean vent ensures proper airflow and keeps your LG dryer running safely.

### Faulty Heating Element or Thermostat

The heating element is responsible for producing the heat inside your LG dryer. It is a vital component that works with other parts to dry clothes. When the heating element malfunctions, it can either produce too much heat or stay on for too long. This uncontrolled heat quickly leads to clothes getting scorched or even catching fire.

Thermostats are safety devices that monitor and regulate the temperature within the dryer. There are usually multiple thermostats, including an operating thermostat and a high-limit thermostat. The operating thermostat turns the heating element on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The high-limit thermostat acts as a fail-safe, shutting off the heating element if the temperature becomes dangerously high. If either of these thermostats fails, the dryer's temperature control is lost.

*   **Stuck Heating Element:** The element may stay on continuously, overheating the drum.
*   **Failed Operating Thermostat:** It might not correctly sense the temperature, allowing it to climb too high.
*   **Tripped High-Limit Thermostat:** This safety feature should prevent overheating, but if it fails to trip, the dryer can reach dangerous temperatures. If your dryer also starts to smell like something is burning, this indicates a serious issue that needs immediate attention.

When a thermostat fails, it can send incorrect temperature readings or simply stop functioning. This means the dryer either doesn't cycle off when it should or continues to heat without proper regulation. This leads to excessive heat inside the drum, burning your clothes. If you suspect a faulty heating element or thermostat, it is best to consult a professional appliance technician. These parts often require special tools and knowledge to test and replace safely.

### Malfunctioning Moisture Sensors

Many modern LG dryers use moisture sensors to detect when clothes are dry. These sensors are small metallic bars located inside the dryer drum. As clothes tumble, they brush against these bars. The dryer measures the electrical conductivity across the wet clothes. When the clothes are still damp, they conduct electricity well. As they dry, their conductivity decreases.

The dryer's control board uses this information to determine the remaining drying time. If these moisture sensors become dirty, damaged, or faulty, they can give inaccurate readings. For example, if the sensors believe the clothes are still wet when they are actually dry, the dryer will continue to run its cycle. This leads to over-drying and exposes your clothes to prolonged heat.

*   **Inaccurate Readings:** Dirty or faulty sensors misjudge the clothes' dryness level.
*   **Extended Drying Cycles:** The dryer continues to run, even when clothes are dry.
*   **Over-Drying:** Clothes are exposed to excessive heat for too long, causing damage.
*   **Fabric Damage:** Prolonged high heat can scorch, shrink, or weaken fabric fibers.

Sometimes, a layer of fabric softener residue or lint can coat the sensors, preventing them from making proper contact with the clothes. This can cause the dryer to keep running, mistakenly thinking the clothes are still wet. I always advise my friends to regularly clean the moisture sensors with a soft cloth and rubbing alcohol. This simple step can often resolve issues related to over-drying. If your LG dryer keeps shutting off before clothes are fully dry, it could also indicate a sensor problem, just the opposite effect of burning. Understanding [does LG dryer sense when clothes are dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-lg-dryer-sense-when-clothes-are-dry) helps in diagnosing related issues.

### Overloading Your LG Dryer

Overloading your LG dryer is a common mistake that can lead to burnt clothes. When you pack too many items into the dryer drum, it creates a densely packed load. This excessive volume of laundry prevents proper air circulation within the drum. Hot air needs space to flow freely around all the clothes to evaporate moisture effectively.

When the drum is overloaded, clothes cannot tumble freely. They remain clumped together, creating damp spots that take longer to dry. Meanwhile, other parts of the load, especially those closer to the heating element or those that become fully dry first, are exposed to continuous heat without proper airflow. This leads to hot spots developing within the load. These hot spots can cause some garments to become excessively hot and eventually scorch or burn.

*   **Restricted Airflow:** Less space for hot air to circulate evenly.
*   **Uneven Drying:** Some clothes dry quickly while others remain damp, creating hot spots.
*   **Prolonged Heat Exposure:** Dry clothes continue to be heated, leading to scorching.
*   **Increased Friction:** Clothes rub against each other more vigorously, generating some heat.

I always recommend filling your dryer drum no more than two-thirds full. This allows enough space for clothes to tumble, separate, and allow hot air to reach all surfaces. Proper loading ensures even drying and prevents your LG dryer from overheating certain areas of the laundry. This simple step can significantly improve drying efficiency and prevent damage to your clothes.

### Improper Dryer Settings

Using the wrong settings on your LG dryer can easily lead to clothes burning. Modern dryers offer various cycles and heat levels for different fabric types. For instance, delicates and synthetics require lower heat settings to prevent damage. Heavy cottons and towels can withstand higher temperatures.

If you select a high heat setting for delicate items like lingerie or activewear, the intense heat can quickly scorch or melt the fabric. Similarly, choosing an extra-long drying cycle for a small load, even on a moderate heat setting, can result in over-drying. The clothes will reach dryness quickly, but the dryer will continue to run, exposing the already dry garments to prolonged heat. This extended heat exposure is a direct path to burning clothes.

*   **Excessive Heat:** High heat for delicate fabrics can cause immediate scorching.
*   **Over-Drying:** Too long a cycle for the load size dries clothes quickly then continues to heat them.
*   **Fabric Sensitivity:** Different materials react differently to heat; synthetics melt easily.
*   **Shrinkage and Damage:** Beyond burning, improper heat can cause irreversible shrinkage and fiber damage.

Always check the care labels on your clothes before putting them in the dryer. Match the dryer cycle and temperature setting to the fabric type and load size. For mixed loads, opt for a medium heat setting or a cycle designed for mixed fabrics. This small effort helps protect your clothes and prevents them from burning. Referencing your LG dryer manual for specific cycle recommendations is also very helpful.

### Worn-Out Drum Bearings or Rollers

Inside your LG dryer, the drum rotates on a set of support rollers and bearings. These components allow the heavy dryer drum to spin smoothly and quietly. Over time, these parts can wear out due to continuous use. Worn drum bearings can cause the drum to wobble or drag, leading to increased friction.

When bearings or rollers are worn, they do not allow the drum to spin freely. This creates additional resistance and friction, which generates heat. This localized heat can transfer to the clothes, causing specific areas of the fabric to scorch or burn. You might also notice unusual noises, such as squealing or thumping, coming from the dryer when these parts are failing.

*   **Increased Friction:** Worn parts rub together, creating excessive heat.
*   **Localized Overheating:** The heat generated can transfer directly to clothes in contact with the drum.
*   **Uneven Rotation:** The drum may not tumble clothes effectively, leading to hot spots.
*   **Audible Signs:** Squealing, grinding, or thumping noises often indicate failing bearings or rollers.

If you hear strange noises or suspect worn parts, it is important to address the issue. Continuing to use a dryer with worn bearings or rollers can not only damage your clothes but also lead to more severe mechanical failures. Replacing these components usually requires disassembling parts of the dryer. This task might be best handled by a qualified technician to ensure safety and proper repair.

### Electrical Issues Within the Dryer

Internal electrical problems can also cause your LG dryer to overheat and burn clothes. The dryer's electrical system includes components like wiring, the motor, and control boards. Any fault in these parts can disrupt the normal flow of electricity or cause excessive resistance, generating heat.

For example, frayed or damaged wiring inside the dryer can lead to arcing or short circuits. These electrical events produce intense localized heat, which can quickly ignite lint or clothes nearby. A failing motor might draw too much current, causing it to overheat. This heat can transfer to the dryer's interior. A faulty control board might send incorrect signals, causing the heating element to stay on or operate at an excessively high temperature.

*   **Frayed Wiring:** Damaged wires can cause arcing and create extreme localized heat.
*   **Overheating Motor:** A failing motor can draw too much power and generate excessive heat.
*   **Faulty Control Board:** Incorrect signals can lead to uncontrolled heating.
*   **Fire Hazard:** Electrical faults are a serious fire risk in any appliance.

These electrical issues are particularly dangerous because they can occur without obvious external signs until it's too late. If you notice any burning smell (not related to lint, but electrical), flickering lights on the control panel, or unusual sounds combined with clothes getting burned, immediately unplug your dryer. Do not use it again until a professional electrician or appliance technician has inspected and repaired the unit. Electrical repairs are complex and should only be performed by certified individuals for safety reasons.
