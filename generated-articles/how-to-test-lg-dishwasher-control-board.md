### Understanding Your LG Dishwasher Control Board

Your LG dishwasher relies on its control board for everything. This board is the "brain" of the appliance. It processes commands you give it. It controls functions like water intake, wash cycles, heating, and draining. When this board fails, the dishwasher stops working as it should.

A control board is an electronic circuit board. It contains microprocessors and relays. These components send electrical signals to different parts of your dishwasher. For example, it tells the wash pump when to activate. It also tells the heating element when to turn on. If any part of the board fails, communication breaks down. This leads to various malfunctions.

Common signs of a faulty LG dishwasher control board include unresponsive buttons. The dishwasher might not power on at all. It may also have erratic cycle behavior. Sometimes, specific error codes will appear on the display. These codes often indicate an electronic issue. Before assuming the worst, we need to test it properly. A thorough test ensures you replace the correct part.

Several factors can cause a control board to fail. Power surges are a common culprit. Water leaks can also short out components. Over time, normal wear and tear can also degrade the board. Understanding its role helps you pinpoint problems more effectively. Our goal is to verify if the board is truly the issue. This prevents unnecessary part replacements.

### Safety First: Preparing for LG Dishwasher Control Board Testing

Working with electrical appliances requires extreme caution. Safety must always be your top priority. Before you touch any internal components, disconnect the dishwasher from its power source. This step prevents electrical shock. It also prevents damage to the appliance. I always ensure the power is off first.

First, turn off the circuit breaker that supplies power to your dishwasher. This is usually found in your home's main electrical panel. Label the breaker clearly for future reference. If you are unsure which breaker it is, turn off the main breaker for your home. This ensures complete power disconnection. Do not rely on simply turning off the dishwasher with its power button.

Next, you will need a few basic tools. A multimeter is essential for testing electrical components. You will use it to check voltage and continuity. You also need a screwdriver set, including Phillips and flathead types. A nut driver set might be useful too. Make sure you have good lighting. A flashlight can help illuminate tight spaces.

Wear appropriate safety gear. This includes work gloves to protect your hands. Safety glasses are also a good idea. They protect your eyes from debris. Clear your work area around the dishwasher. Make sure there is enough space to work comfortably. Having the right tools and a safe environment makes the testing process smoother. Taking these precautions is vital for your safety.

### Initial Troubleshooting: Rule Out Simple Issues Before Testing

Before diving into complex electrical tests, check the basics. Many dishwasher problems stem from simple, easily fixable issues. A control board replacement is often unnecessary. I always start with these quick checks. This saves time and effort.

First, verify that the dishwasher is receiving power. Check the power cord. Make sure it is plugged in securely to the outlet. Sometimes, a loose plug causes issues. Next, inspect your home's circuit breaker. It might have tripped. Reset it by turning it completely off, then back on. Ensure there are no blown fuses in the house, if applicable.

The door latch is another common culprit. Your dishwasher will not start if the door is not fully closed and latched. Check the latch mechanism. Make sure it engages properly. Sometimes, food debris or a misaligned door can prevent proper latching. Test the door switch for continuity if you suspect it. You can learn more about general dishwasher troubleshooting, for example, by understanding [how to start an LG dishwasher with a top control panel](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-start-lg-dishwasher-top-control).

Check the water supply. Ensure the water valve connected to the dishwasher is open. Low water pressure can prevent cycles from starting. Inspect the drain hose for kinks or blockages. A clogged drain can stop the wash cycle. Running these quick diagnostic checks helps you rule out non-board related issues. Only after confirming these are not the problem should you proceed with control board testing.

### Locating and Accessing the LG Dishwasher Control Board

Finding the control board on an LG dishwasher is the next step. Its location can vary slightly by model. However, it is usually accessible from the front or bottom of the appliance. I find it is most often behind the kick plate or the main door panel. Being prepared for either location helps.

To access the control board, you might need to remove the front kick plate. This is the trim piece at the very bottom of the dishwasher. It is typically held by a few screws. Use your screwdriver to remove these screws. Gently pull the kick plate away. The control board might be mounted just behind it. It will be encased in a protective box.

For some LG models, the control board is located within the main door assembly. To reach it, you need to carefully separate the inner and outer door panels. First, open the dishwasher door completely. Look along the edges of the inner door panel. You will find several screws holding the two panels together. Remove these screws. Work slowly and carefully to avoid damaging any wiring or components. Be mindful of sharp edges.

Once the screws are removed, gently separate the panels. The control board will likely be mounted on the inside of the outer door panel. It will have multiple wire harnesses connected to it. Take a photo of the wire connections before disconnecting anything. This helps with reassembly. Always handle the control board with care. It is a delicate electronic component.

### Performing Visual Inspection of the Control Board

Once you access the LG dishwasher control board, perform a detailed visual inspection. This step is crucial. Sometimes, a faulty board shows clear physical signs of damage. This means you do not need a multimeter to confirm a problem. I always look for visible red flags first.

Carefully examine the entire surface of the control board. Look for any signs of burn marks. Burnt spots indicate an electrical short or an overloaded component. These areas often appear darkened or charred. They are usually concentrated around resistors or capacitors. Any discoloration on the board itself is a bad sign.

Next, check for swollen or bulging capacitors. Capacitors are small, cylindrical components. They store electrical energy. When they fail, they often swell at the top. Sometimes, they even burst open. A bulging capacitor means it is no longer functioning correctly. This can disrupt the entire board's operation.

Also, inspect for signs of water damage or corrosion. Water can leak into the control area. This causes components to corrode. Corrosion appears as a greenish or whitish powdery residue. Even a small amount of water damage can short out circuits. Look closely at the pins and connectors. Rust or residue on these points indicates a problem. If you find any of these visual faults, the control board is likely defective. A replacement is usually necessary at this point. This visual check can be as effective as electrical tests for obvious issues.

### Testing LG Dishwasher Control Board Components with a Multimeter

When visual inspection reveals no obvious issues, use a multimeter. This tool helps confirm the control board's functionality. You will check for voltage and continuity. These tests identify electrical faults. Knowing [how to test a Samsung dishwasher control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-samsung-dishwasher-control-board) or a [Maytag dishwasher control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-maytag-dishwasher-control-board) uses similar principles, as do other appliance control boards.

First, set your multimeter to measure AC voltage. Reconnect the power to the dishwasher temporarily for this test. Be extremely careful. Use the probes to test the main power input to the control board. You should read approximately 120 volts AC. If there is no voltage, the problem lies with the power supply to the board, not necessarily the board itself. Check the wiring harness. Ensure it is securely connected. This might be a power cord issue or a house wiring issue.

Next, you will check for continuity. This test determines if a circuit is complete. Set your multimeter to the continuity setting (often indicated by a speaker symbol). Disconnect the dishwasher power again for this test. Remove the wire harnesses from the control board. Use the multimeter probes to test continuity across specific components. Consult your dishwasher's service manual for the exact test points. Common points include relays or fuses on the board itself. A "beep" or a reading of 0 ohms indicates continuity. No beep or an "OL" (open loop) reading means the circuit is broken. This suggests a fault.

You can also test output voltage to specific components if the service manual provides these points. For instance, test the voltage going to the wash pump or drain pump. If the board is sending no voltage, but receiving input voltage, it might be faulty. Remember to document all your readings. This helps in pinpointing the exact issue. Be careful when handling probes, especially with power connected. You can also apply these testing methods when you [test an LG dryer control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-lg-dryer-control-board).

#### Testing Specific Components (Advanced)

For more advanced testing, you might need to test individual relays or resistors on the board. Relays are small, often black, rectangular boxes. They act as switches. Set your multimeter to the resistance (ohms) setting. Test the resistance across the coil of a relay. Compare your reading to the specifications in the service manual. A significantly different reading indicates a faulty relay.

Resistors, usually small, striped components, can also fail. They control current flow. Use the resistance setting to test them. Match the measured resistance to the color code on the resistor. A resistor that reads "OL" is open and faulty. Be aware that components often need to be desoldered for accurate resistance testing. This prevents interference from other parts of the circuit. This level of repair is typically for experienced technicians.

If you find multiple faulty components on the board, replacing the entire board is usually more practical. Repairing individual components requires specialized soldering skills. It can also be time-consuming. A new control board ensures all components are fresh. This gives your dishwasher a fresh start.

### Interpreting Test Results and Next Steps

After completing your tests, you need to interpret the results. This helps you decide the next course of action. Your findings will tell you if the LG dishwasher control board is truly the problem. I always review my notes carefully at this stage.

If your visual inspection revealed burnt spots, corrosion, or bulging capacitors, the board is certainly bad. These are clear signs of irreversible damage. You can confidently proceed with replacing the control board. No further electrical testing is usually needed in such cases. The physical damage confirms the fault.

If the multimeter tests showed no main power input, the issue is not the control board itself. You need to investigate the power supply. Check the outlet, the power cord, and the circuit breaker again. Ensure all connections are secure. If you have confirmed consistent 120V AC input to the board, but the board still shows no signs of life or provides incorrect outputs, the board is likely faulty.

When continuity tests reveal open circuits where there should be continuity, this also points to a bad board. A broken trace or a failed internal component prevents the current from flowing. This means the board cannot properly send signals. If a specific component like a relay tests bad, and you are skilled enough, you might attempt to replace just that component. However, this is advanced. For most users, replacing the entire control board is the standard solution. Knowing [how to replace a GE dishwasher control board](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-ge-dishwasher-control-board) or other brands helps put the process in context.

A functional control board will have proper input voltage, show continuity where expected, and provide correct output voltages to other components. If your tests indicate the board is fine, but the dishwasher still malfunctions, the problem lies elsewhere. You might need to test other components like the wash motor, drain pump, or door latch switch. Sometimes, a thermal fuse or heating element can also cause issues. This systematic approach ensures accurate troubleshooting.

### Replacing Your LG Dishwasher Control Board (Brief Overview)

If your tests confirm a faulty LG dishwasher control board, replacement is the next step. This process involves careful removal of the old board and installation of the new one. It is a manageable DIY task. Always remember to maintain a strong focus on safety.
