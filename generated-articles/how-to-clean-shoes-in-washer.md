## Clean Shoes in the Washer: Your Ultimate Guide

Have you ever looked at your favorite sneakers, covered in dirt or grime, and wondered if your washing machine could rescue them? You are not alone. Many people hesitate to put shoes in the washer. They worry about damage to the shoes or the machine.

Learning how to clean shoes in washer can save you time and effort. It can also extend the life of your footwear. This guide will walk you through each step. We will cover which shoes are safe for washing. We will also discuss proper preparation, machine settings, and drying methods. Get ready to give your shoes a fresh, clean start.

### Takeaway

Cleaning shoes in a washing machine requires careful steps.
*   Always check shoe material first; not all shoes are machine washable.
*   Pre-treat tough stains and remove loose dirt.
*   Use a mesh laundry bag and old towels for protection.
*   Wash with cold water on a delicate or gentle cycle.

To clean shoes in a washer, first, check the material; most athletic or canvas shoes are safe. Prepare them by removing laces and insoles, and pre-treating stains. Use a mesh bag and towels in a cold, gentle cycle with mild detergent. Air dry thoroughly away from direct heat.

## Understanding Which Shoes You Can Wash

Not all shoes are made for a washing machine. Different materials react differently to water and agitation. Knowing which shoes are safe prevents damage. You want to clean your shoes, not ruin them.

Most athletic shoes and canvas sneakers are good candidates. This includes materials like nylon, cotton, and some synthetic blends. These materials withstand water and mild detergents well. For example, [how to clean canvas shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-canvas-shoes) often involves machine washing. Similarly, many people want to know [how to clean tennis shoes in washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-tennis-shoes-in-washer).

However, some shoes should never go in the washer. Leather, suede, silk, and delicate embellishments are high-risk materials. Water can damage leather and suede, causing them to shrink, crack, or lose shape. Delicate parts can fall off or get damaged during agitation. Always check the shoe's care label if it has one. If no label exists, consider the material carefully. When in doubt, hand-wash delicate shoes.

### Materials Safe for Machine Washing

Many common shoe types are suitable for machine washing. This includes sneakers made of canvas, nylon, and synthetic meshes. These materials handle water and detergent without much issue. Running shoes, gym shoes, and many everyday casual sneakers fit this category. They are built to be durable and often encounter dirt and sweat. Machine washing helps keep them fresh.

For instance, if you own several pairs of white athletic shoes, knowing [how to clean white shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes) often includes machine washing. The gentle cycle helps lift grime without harsh scrubbing. This method saves you time compared to hand cleaning each shoe. Always ensure the shoes are structurally sound before washing.

### Materials to Avoid Washing

You must avoid washing certain shoe materials in a machine. Leather shoes, suede shoes, and any shoes with delicate decorations should stay out. Leather can stiffen and crack, losing its natural oils when wet. Suede can shrink, get water stains, and become permanently damaged. Shoes with sequins, beads, or other glued-on elements might lose these parts in the wash.

High heels, dress shoes, and boots are generally not machine washable. The structure of these shoes, often including cardboard or stiffeners, can warp. Glued components can dissolve, leading to separation of soles or uppers. For these types of shoes, special cleaning methods are necessary. You may need specific leather cleaners or suede brushes.

## Prepping Your Shoes for the Washer

Proper preparation is a key step before you clean shoes in washer. This step ensures a more effective clean. It also protects both your shoes and your washing machine. Do not skip this part of the process.

Start by removing any loose dirt or mud. This prevents the dirt from spreading inside your washing machine. You can use a stiff brush or an old toothbrush for this. Getting rid of surface debris makes the washing machine's job easier. It also reduces the amount of dirt entering your drain. If your shoes are very muddy, use a garden hose to rinse off the worst of it outside. This is especially important for items like [how to clean muddy shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-muddy-shoes).

Next, remove the shoelaces and insoles. Wash these items separately or put them inside a mesh laundry bag with the shoes. Shoelaces can tangle around the agitator or other items in the wash. Insoles often need more direct cleaning. Removing them allows both the shoes' interior and the insoles to dry more thoroughly. This helps with odor control.

### Cleaning Off Loose Dirt and Debris

Before anything else, address visible dirt. Take your shoes outside or over a trash can. Use a soft brush, an old toothbrush, or a damp cloth. Scrape off any caked-on mud, dirt, or debris from the soles and uppers. This initial cleaning stops large chunks of dirt from clogging your machine's filter. It also prevents dirt from redepositing on the shoes during the wash cycle.

For heavily soiled shoes, a simple rinse with water can help. A strong blast from a hose can dislodge stubborn grime. This step is vital for a truly clean outcome. It prepares the shoe surfaces for a deeper wash. This early effort makes a big difference in the final result.

### Removing Laces and Insoles

Laces and insoles should always come out before washing. Laces can become tangled in the washing machine''s drum or around other items. This can damage the laces or even the machine. Place them in a small mesh laundry bag. This keeps them together and prevents tangles. You can wash them alongside your shoes.

Insoles, especially those that absorb sweat, need individual attention. Removing them allows both the inside of the shoe and the insoles to get a proper cleaning. It also helps them dry faster and more completely. This step prevents lingering odors. If insoles are particularly smelly, you might want to hand wash them or soak them separately.

### Pre-Treating Stains

Spot-treating stains before washing boosts cleaning effectiveness. For tough spots, apply a stain remover or a mix of laundry detergent and water directly to the stain. Let it sit for about 15-30 minutes. This gives the cleaning agents time to break down the grime. This process is important for addressing how to clean stained shoes effectively.

Use a soft brush or cloth to gently scrub the pre-treated areas. This helps lift the stain from the fabric. Avoid harsh brushes that can damage delicate materials. For white shoes, you might consider a small amount of oxygen bleach for stubborn discoloration. Always test any pre-treatment product on an inconspicuous area first. This checks for colorfastness or material reactions.

## Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings

The right washing machine settings are crucial for cleaning shoes without causing damage. You want a gentle wash. This protects the shoe's structure and materials. Incorrect settings can lead to shrinking, warping, or even unraveling.

Always use cold water when washing shoes. Hot water can cause materials to shrink. It can also break down glues used in shoe construction. A cold wash helps preserve the shoe's shape and integrity. It is also more energy efficient.

Select a delicate or gentle cycle. This cycle uses less agitation. Less agitation means less stress on your shoes. It mimics hand washing more closely. Some machines have a specific "hand wash" or "bulky items" cycle which can also work. Avoid any cycles with high spin speeds, as this can be too harsh for footwear. Understanding your machine, whether it's a [how to clean washer top loader](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washer-top-loader) or a front-loader, helps you choose the best settings.

### Cold Water Cycle Benefits

Using cold water for washing shoes offers several benefits. Firstly, cold water helps prevent shrinking. Many shoe materials, especially synthetic ones, can deform with heat. Hot water can also cause colors to bleed, potentially staining other parts of the shoe. Secondly, glues used in shoe construction are sensitive to heat. Cold water helps maintain the bond of these glues. This protects the shoe's overall structure.

Finally, cold water is energy-efficient. It reduces your electricity consumption. This makes the cleaning process more environmentally friendly. Always choose the coldest water setting available. This ensures the safest wash for your beloved footwear.

### Gentle or Delicate Cycle Selection

The "gentle" or "delicate" cycle is your best friend when washing shoes. These cycles use minimal agitation. They mimic the motion of hand washing. High agitation cycles, like "heavy duty," can be too harsh. They can cause shoes to bang around, leading to damage to the shoes themselves or the machine's drum. Less agitation also reduces wear and tear on the shoe's fabric and stitching.

Some washing machines also have a "bulky items" or "hand wash" setting. These can also be suitable. They often use more water and a slower spin. This combination offers a soft but effective clean. Always check your machine's manual for specific cycle descriptions. Your goal is to provide a thorough clean without risking structural damage.

### Avoiding High Spin Speeds

After the wash cycle, your machine will typically go into a spin cycle. It is important to avoid high spin speeds for shoes. High speeds can cause shoes to bang violently against the drum walls. This can damage the shoes, deforming their shape or breaking internal components. It can also stress your washing machine.

If possible, select the lowest spin speed setting. Some machines allow you to customize the spin speed. If not, consider stopping the cycle before the high-speed spin begins. You can then gently wring out excess water by hand. This careful approach helps protect both your footwear and your appliance from unnecessary wear.

## Detergents and Cleaning Boosters for Shoes

Choosing the right cleaning agents is as important as the correct machine settings. You want products that clean effectively without being too harsh. Harsh chemicals can degrade shoe materials. They can also leave residue.

Use a mild liquid laundry detergent. Powder detergents may not dissolve completely. This can leave a white residue on your shoes, especially dark ones. Look for detergents free of harsh dyes or strong perfumes. A small amount is usually enough; do not overdo it. Too much detergent creates excessive suds, which are hard to rinse away.

For extra cleaning power, consider adding some natural boosters. Baking soda is excellent for odor control and mild stain removal. White vinegar can also help with odors and acts as a fabric softener. These natural options are gentle on shoes and washing machines. They are also safer for the environment. You might be interested in [how to clean shoes with baking soda](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shoes-with-baking-soda) for a more in-depth approach.

### Using Mild Liquid Laundry Detergent

A mild liquid laundry detergent is the best choice for cleaning shoes. Unlike powder detergents, liquid forms dissolve quickly in cold water. This reduces the risk of leaving powdery residue on your shoes. Choose a detergent free from strong bleach or harsh chemicals. These additives can strip colors or damage delicate shoe materials.

Measure out a small amount, typically half the amount you would use for a normal load of clothes. Too much detergent can create excessive suds. This makes rinsing difficult. Residue can then build up on the shoes. A gentle formula ensures a thorough clean without compromising the shoe's integrity or color.

### Natural Cleaning Boosters: Baking Soda and Vinegar

Baking soda and white vinegar are excellent natural additions for shoe cleaning. Baking soda is a fantastic deodorizer. It absorbs and neutralizes unpleasant smells. This is especially helpful for refreshing smelly shoes. Add about half a cup of baking soda directly to the washer drum. It also aids in gentle stain removal, particularly for lighter fabrics.

White vinegar acts as a natural fabric softener and mild disinfectant. It helps break down residue and can further combat odors. Add about half a cup to the fabric softener dispenser or directly into the wash. Do not mix vinegar and baking soda directly before adding to the wash. They react and lose their effectiveness. Both are safe for your shoes and washing machine. They provide a gentle, yet powerful, cleaning boost.

### Avoiding Bleach and Harsh Cleaners

When washing shoes, steer clear of bleach and other harsh chemical cleaners. Bleach can cause irreversible damage to shoe materials. It can weaken fabrics, making them brittle and prone to tearing. For colored shoes, bleach will strip the dye, leading to unsightly discoloration. Even on white shoes, repeated bleach use can cause yellowing over time.

Harsh cleaners can also break down the adhesives that hold shoes together. This might lead to soles detaching or other structural failures. Stick to mild detergents and natural boosters. These options clean effectively without risking damage to your footwear. Your shoes will last longer and look better.

## Protecting Your Washer (and Shoes) During the Cycle

Protecting both your washing machine and your shoes is important. Shoes can be heavy and abrasive. They can cause damage if not properly contained. Your goal is a clean pair of shoes without any household mishaps.

Use a mesh laundry bag for your shoes. Place each shoe in a separate bag or use one large bag for the pair. This bag prevents the shoes from banging directly against the washer drum. It also stops laces or loose parts from getting caught. Mesh bags are porous, allowing water and detergent to circulate freely.

Add a few old towels to the wash load. These towels act as cushioning. They absorb some of the impact and noise from the shoes during agitation. This protects the washer drum from dents or scratches. The towels also help balance the load. This prevents the machine from vibrating excessively. Use dark-colored towels if you are worried about color transfer from your shoes.

### Using Mesh Laundry Bags

Mesh laundry bags are essential for machine washing shoes. These bags provide a protective barrier. They keep shoes from banging directly against the inside of your washer. This prevents potential damage to the machine's drum. The bags also protect the shoes themselves. They stop laces from tangling and prevent small parts from getting lost.

Choose sturdy mesh bags designed for delicate items. Place each shoe into its own bag, or put the pair into one large bag. The mesh material allows water and detergent to flow through easily. This ensures a thorough clean. Once zipped, these bags keep your shoes contained throughout the entire wash cycle.

### Adding Old Towels for Cushioning

Adding a few old towels to the washer load serves a dual purpose. Firstly, they act as a buffer. The towels cushion the shoes during agitation and spin cycles. This reduces the banging noise and protects both the shoes and the washing machine from impact damage. Without towels, shoes can hit the drum violently.

Secondly, towels help balance the wash load. An unbalanced load causes the washing machine to shake and vibrate excessively. This can put strain on the machine's components. Using 3-4 old towels helps distribute the weight evenly. This creates a smoother, quieter wash cycle. Make sure the towels are old, as some color transfer might occur from very dirty shoes.

### Avoiding Overloading the Washer

It is important to avoid overloading your washing machine when cleaning shoes. Too many items can hinder proper cleaning. The shoes need room to move freely within the drum. This allows water and detergent to circulate effectively around them. Overloading also puts strain on your washing machine's motor. It can lead to an unbalanced load, causing excessive shaking.

Wash one to two pairs of shoes at a time, depending on their size. Ensure there is enough space for the shoes and the cushioning towels. A well-loaded machine ensures a more efficient wash. It also protects your appliance from unnecessary wear and tear. Give your shoes space to get truly clean.

## Drying Your Shoes Safely After Washing

Drying shoes correctly after washing is just as important as the washing process. Improper drying can lead to damage. It can also cause unpleasant odors. You want your shoes to be completely dry before wearing them again.

Never put your shoes in a clothes dryer. The high heat from a dryer can shrink materials. It can also melt glues, leading to soles detaching. The tumbling action can damage the shoe's structure. It can also create a loud, disruptive noise. This can also harm your dryer. This is a common pitfall people face when they [clean tennis shoes how to](https://homeessentialsguide.com/clean-tennis-shoes-how-to) effectively.

Air drying is the safest and most effective method. Find a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Sunlight can fade colors. High heat can still cause warping or damage. Stuff the shoes with paper towels or newspaper. This helps absorb moisture and maintains the shoe's shape. Replace the paper periodically as it gets damp. Drying can take 24-48 hours. Patience is key for fresh, intact shoes. This also helps with [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean) for longer.

### Why Air Drying is Essential

Air drying is the only recommended method for drying machine-washed shoes. The delicate materials and adhesives in shoes cannot withstand the high heat of a clothes dryer. Heat can cause materials to shrink or warp. It can also melt the glues that hold shoe components together, leading to detachment of soles or other parts. Air drying preserves the shoe's original shape and structural integrity.

Additionally, tumbling shoes in a dryer can be very noisy and potentially damage the dryer itself. The constant banging can create dents or wear on the dryer drum. Air drying eliminates these risks entirely. It allows a gentle, natural evaporation of moisture.

### Tips for Effective Air Drying

To air dry your shoes effectively, follow a few simple tips. First, remove the insoles and laces if you washed them separately. This allows maximum airflow to all parts of the shoe. Second, stuff the shoes with paper towels or crumpled newspaper. This material absorbs internal moisture. It also helps maintain the shoe's original shape as it dries. Change the paper every few hours, or as it becomes damp.

Place the shoes in a well-ventilated area. A spot with good air circulation is ideal. This could be near an open window or in a room with a fan. Avoid direct sunlight or heat sources like radiators. Direct heat can still cause shrinking or fading. Allow at least 24 to 48 hours for complete drying. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them again to prevent mold or odor. This proactive step helps you learn [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean) for extended periods.

### Preventing Mold and Odor During Drying

Proper drying prevents mold growth and lingering odors. When shoes remain damp, they become a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. These microorganisms cause foul smells and can damage the shoe material. The key is to ensure complete and thorough drying.

Start by stuffing the shoes as mentioned, changing the paper often. Position the shoes so air can flow around them, not just over them. You can hang them by their laces or place them on a rack. If you notice any lingering musty smell after drying, a sprinkle of baking soda inside the shoes can help absorb residual odor before storage. This focus on complete drying prevents issues and helps manage [how to clean smelly shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes) in the long run.

## Troubleshooting Common Washer Cleaning Issues

Sometimes, issues arise even when you follow all the steps. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems helps. You can save your shoes and avoid re-washing. Common issues include residual stains or lingering odors.

If stains remain, spot-treat them again. Sometimes, a machine wash cannot remove deeply set stains. Use a specialized stain remover or a paste of baking soda and water. Gently scrub the area by hand. For white shoes, a gentle brush and a whitening paste may be needed. If the stain is from mud, make sure you properly handled [how to clean muddy shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-muddy-shoes) before the wash.

Lingering odors are another common complaint. This happens if shoes did not dry completely or if the initial smell was very strong. Baking soda is your best friend here. Sprinkle it generously inside the shoes and let it sit overnight. Vacuum or shake it out the next morning. For persistent smells, you might also need to address [how to clean smelly washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-smelly-washer) as the machine itself might retain odors.

### Addressing Residual Stains

Despite careful washing, some stubborn stains might remain. Do not put the shoes back in the washer immediately. Instead, target the specific stain. For most fabrics, a mixture of mild detergent and warm water works. Apply it directly to the stain. Use an old toothbrush or a soft cloth to gently scrub the area. Work the solution into the fabric.

For white or light-colored shoes, a paste of baking soda and a little water can be effective. Apply the paste, let it sit for 30 minutes, then scrub gently. Rinse the spot with clean water. Repeat if necessary. For really tough stains, specialized fabric stain removers might be needed, but always test them first on an inconspicuous area.

### Dealing with Lingering Odors

Lingering odors after washing usually indicate incomplete drying or very deep-set smells. The most effective way to combat this is with baking soda. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each shoe. Let it sit for several hours or, ideally, overnight. Baking soda absorbs odors. After the time passes, shake out the powder or vacuum it from the shoes.

For persistent odors, consider odor-absorbing inserts. You can also place the shoes in a well-ventilated area with sunlight for a few hours. Sunlight has natural antibacterial properties. Ensure the shoes are completely dry before storing them. Proper drying and odor control are key to [how to clean smelly shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes) effectively.

### When to Consider Professional Cleaning

Sometimes, machine washing is not enough or is not safe for certain shoes. If your shoes are made of delicate materials like suede, leather, or silk, a professional cleaner is the best option. These materials require specialized cleaning methods. They can be easily damaged by water or harsh chemicals.

Also, if your shoes have significant structural damage, intricate embellishments, or highly valued, a professional can assess them. They have expertise in restoring different types of footwear. Professional cleaning ensures your valuable shoes are handled with care. This saves you from potential irreversible damage.

## Maintaining Your Shoes for Longer Life

Cleaning your shoes effectively is one part of keeping them in good condition. Regular maintenance is another. Consistent care helps extend the life of your shoes. It keeps them looking good between washes.

Wipe down your shoes after each use. A simple wipe with a damp cloth can remove surface dirt. This prevents grime from building up and becoming stubborn stains. Pay attention to the soles and sides. This quick habit prevents the need for frequent deep cleaning. It makes future washes easier.

Store your shoes properly. Keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing them in direct sunlight or damp areas. Direct sun can fade colors. Dampness can lead to mold and mildew. Shoe trees can help maintain the shape of your shoes during storage. These practices contribute to [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean) and well-preserved.

### Regular Wiping and Spot Cleaning

Developing a habit of wiping down your shoes after each wear makes a big difference. Use a damp cloth to remove surface dirt, dust, and light scuffs. This prevents dirt from setting into the fabric. For small, fresh stains, spot clean them immediately. A dab of mild soap on a wet cloth can work wonders. Addressing dirt quickly stops it from becoming a stubborn problem. This simple routine keeps shoes looking fresh between full washes. It reduces the frequency of deep cleaning.

### Proper Storage Techniques

Storing your shoes correctly is vital for their longevity. Always store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Sunlight can cause colors to fade and materials to degrade over time. Damp environments encourage mold and mildew growth. Ensure shoes are completely dry before storing them to prevent moisture-related issues.

Using shoe trees helps maintain the shoe's shape. They prevent creases and wrinkles from forming. For less structured shoes, stuffing them with acid-free tissue paper can also help. Proper storage protects shoes from dust, light, and humidity. This keeps them ready for your next wear.

### Protecting Shoes from Future Dirt

Preventative measures can significantly reduce how often you need to clean your shoes. Applying a protective spray to your shoes creates a barrier against water and stains. Many sprays are available for different shoe materials, like canvas, fabric, or even some leathers. Always test the spray on a small, inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not discolor the material.

Another simple tip is to avoid excessively dirty environments. If you know you will be in muddy or dusty areas, consider wearing older shoes. You can also try to brush off loose dirt as soon as possible after exposure. These practices help keep your shoes cleaner for longer periods.
