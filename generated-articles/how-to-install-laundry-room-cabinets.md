## How To Install Laundry Room Cabinets for Better Storage

Are you tired of cluttered laundry spaces? Many of us wish for more organization in this busy area of our homes. Installing laundry room cabinets can change your space from chaotic to calm. It gives you dedicated spots for detergents, fabric softeners, and other supplies.

Adding cabinets also creates a cleaner, more finished look. This project is a popular DIY task for homeowners. You can truly make your laundry room work better for you. We will go through each step to help you successfully install your new cabinets.

### Takeaway

*   Proper planning ensures cabinets fit and function well.
*   Accurate measurements and markings are key for straight installation.
*   Securing cabinets to wall studs provides strong support.
*   Leveling cabinets prevents crooked appearances and issues.
*   Finishing touches create a polished, usable laundry area.

Installing laundry room cabinets involves careful planning, precise measurement, and secure mounting. You begin by mapping your layout and marking wall studs. Then, you attach a ledger board to support upper units. Next, you lift and secure upper cabinets, making sure they are level. Finally, you install any base cabinets and add hardware to complete your organized space.

## Plan Your Laundry Room Cabinet Layout

Before you install laundry room cabinets, you need a solid plan. Think about what you want to store. Do you need tall cabinets for a broom or smaller ones for detergents? Visualizing your space helps a lot.

Start by measuring your laundry room walls. Write down the height, width, and any obstructions like windows or electrical outlets. Consider where your washer and dryer sit. This helps determine cabinet placement. Many people like to install upper cabinets above the machines.

### Measure Your Space Accurately

Take precise measurements of your walls. Use a tape measure and mark down every dimension. You want to know the available width and height for your cabinets. This prevents buying cabinets that do not fit. I always double-check my measurements to avoid mistakes.

*   Measure wall length where cabinets will go.
*   Measure height from floor to ceiling.
*   Note distances to windows, doors, and plumbing.
*   Consider clearance for opening cabinet doors.

Think about how much space you need above your washer and dryer. This is important for accessibility. Most top-loading machines need space to open the lid. Front-loaders might allow for cabinets much closer above them. This small detail can make a big difference in how well your laundry room functions daily.

### Choose Your Cabinet Style

Cabinets come in many styles and sizes. You can pick stock cabinets for standard sizes or custom ones for unique spaces. Consider the material, like wood, laminate, or MDF. Each material has pros and cons for durability and cost.

Think about the overall look you want for your laundry room. Do you want open shelving or closed storage? Decide if you want base cabinets, wall cabinets, or a mix of both. This choice affects the entire installation process. Base cabinets install differently than wall-mounted ones.

I prefer wall cabinets in a laundry room to keep the floor clear. However, base cabinets can offer counter space. They also allow for drawers, which are great for small items. Make your choices based on your needs and budget.

## Gather Tools for Cabinet Installation

Having the right tools ready makes the job much smoother. You do not want to stop mid-project to search for an item. Before you install laundry room cabinets, prepare your workspace. Lay out everything you need within easy reach.

This preparation saves time and reduces frustration. I always create a checklist to ensure I have every tool. It helps me stay organized from start to finish. Good tools also make the work safer and more accurate.

### Essential Tools and Materials

You need several common tools for this project. A drill, level, and stud finder are crucial. These tools ensure your cabinets are straight and secure. Safety gear like gloves and safety glasses protect you.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Measuring Tools:** Tape measure, pencil, straight edge
*   **Marking Tools:** Stud finder, laser level or long level
*   **Cutting Tools (if needed):** Utility knife, possibly a saw for fillers
*   **Drilling/Fastening:** Cordless drill, various drill bits, driver bits
*   **Fasteners:** Wood screws (2.5-3 inches), cabinet screws, shims
*   **Mounting Aids:** Ledger board (a straight piece of wood), clamps
*   **Safety Gear:** Safety glasses, gloves

You will also need the cabinets themselves, filler strips if gaps exist, and cabinet hardware. Having all these items ready saves valuable time. Double-check your list before you begin.

### Preparing Cabinet Components

Some cabinets come pre-assembled, while others require assembly. If your cabinets need assembly, do this step before you begin installation. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Assembling them beforehand ensures they are sturdy.

Pre-drilling pilot holes for screws makes assembly easier. This also prevents wood splitting. If you are installing new hinges, you might find tips on [how to install hidden hinges on old cabinets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-hidden-hinges-on-old-cabinets). This can give your new cabinets a clean look. Make sure all cabinet doors and drawers operate smoothly once assembled.

Do not forget to consider any internal components. If you plan to add special organizers, like [how to install sliding drawers in kitchen cabinets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-sliding-drawers-in-kitchen-cabinets), plan for those now. This ensures your cabinets are fully functional from day one. I like to have everything ready for a smooth flow.

## Prepare the Wall for Cabinet Mounting

Proper wall preparation is vital for a successful cabinet install. The walls must be strong and clean. You cannot just screw cabinets anywhere. You need to find the studs.

Locating wall studs gives your cabinets a secure anchor point. Without proper anchoring, your cabinets could pull away from the wall. This creates a dangerous situation. Take your time with this step.

### Find and Mark Wall Studs

Use a stud finder to locate the wall studs. Studs are the vertical wooden beams behind your drywall. They provide the necessary support for heavy cabinets. Mark the center of each stud with a pencil.

Draw a vertical line down each stud. This gives you a clear guide for drilling. I often mark a few feet above and below where the cabinets will sit. This ensures I can easily see the lines when lifting the cabinets.

*   Slide the stud finder across the wall horizontally.
*   Mark the edges of each stud lightly.
*   Find the center point between the edges.
*   Draw a plumb line down the center of each stud.

Ensure your lines are perfectly straight. A long level helps here. Accurate stud marking prevents drilling into empty drywall. It also ensures the weight of your cabinets distributes evenly across strong points.

### Clear and Clean the Area

Remove any old shelves, hooks, or decor from the wall. You need a clear workspace. Dust and debris can interfere with accurate measurements. A clean surface makes marking easier.

Wipe down the walls where the cabinets will sit. This removes grime. If you are dealing with very dirty walls, a simple wipe might not be enough. You might need to clean the walls more thoroughly. This helps prevent dust from getting into your new cabinets later.

Protect your floor before you start the installation. Use drop cloths or old blankets. This catches any falling debris or tools. It also protects your flooring from scratches during installation.

## Mark and Mount the Ledger Board

A ledger board is a straight piece of wood used to support upper cabinets during installation. It acts as a temporary shelf. This board takes the weight of the cabinet, freeing your hands to secure it. Using a ledger board makes cabinet installation much simpler and safer.

I always use a ledger board when installing wall cabinets. It ensures the cabinets are perfectly level across the top. It also gives me a break from holding heavy cabinets. This method makes a big difference in the ease of the process.

### Determine Cabinet Height and Mark the Line

First, decide how high you want your upper cabinets to hang. Measure up from the floor. Standard height for upper cabinets is usually 54 inches from the floor to the bottom of the cabinet. However, in a laundry room, you might adjust this for clearance over your washer and dryer. Account for countertop if you plan to install one below.

Once you determine the height, use a long level and pencil to draw a perfectly straight, horizontal line across the wall. This line marks the bottom edge of your cabinets. This is your guide for the ledger board. Make sure this line is truly level.

*   Measure desired height from the floor up.
*   Mark this point on the wall.
*   Use a laser level or long spirit level to draw a straight, level line across the entire length where cabinets will sit.
*   Double-check that the line is perfectly horizontal.

This line is critical for the finished look of your cabinets. Any tilt will be obvious later. Spend extra time here to get it right.

### Mount the Ledger Board Securely

Align the top edge of your ledger board with the level line you just drew. Use a 1x4 or 2x4 piece of straight lumber for your ledger board. It should be long enough to span the entire cabinet run. Secure it to the wall studs using screws.

Drill pilot holes through the ledger board and into the center of each stud. Then drive 2.5-inch wood screws to hold it firmly in place. The ledger board must be very sturdy. It will temporarily hold the weight of your cabinets.

When I install mine, I make sure it cannot budge. Test it by applying some downward pressure. If it flexes, add more screws or use longer ones. This board is your friend during the heavy lifting part of the installation.

## Installing the Upper Laundry Room Cabinets

This is where your laundry room truly starts to take shape. Installing the upper cabinets requires careful lifting and securing. Work with a helper if possible. Even small cabinets can be awkward to handle alone.

Having someone assist you makes aligning and screwing cabinets much easier. It also makes the process safer. Remember, we are building a functional and attractive space. Taking your time here pays off.

### Lift and Secure the First Cabinet

Start installing from one end of your cabinet run. If you have a corner, start with the corner cabinet. Lift the first cabinet onto the ledger board. Make sure the cabinet's bottom edge rests squarely on the board.

Push the cabinet firmly against the wall. Use a level to check that the cabinet is plumb (vertically straight) and level (horizontally straight). Adjust with shims behind the cabinet if needed, especially if your wall is not perfectly flat. Shim at the top, bottom, and middle where the cabinet meets the wall studs.

Once level and plumb, drive a 2.5-inch cabinet screw through the cabinet's back frame and into the wall studs. Use at least two screws per stud, one near the top and one near the bottom. Do not overtighten yet. Just get them secure enough to hold.

For specific cabinet types, you might find tips on [how to install a corner cabinet](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-a-corner-cabinet). These can be tricky due to their shape. Corner cabinets often get installed first. This provides a starting point for other cabinets.

### Join Cabinets Together

After the first cabinet is secure, bring the next cabinet up. Push it tightly against the first cabinet. Clamp the two cabinet face frames together. Use cabinet clamps to pull them flush. This creates a seamless appearance.

Drill pilot holes through the face frames where they meet. Use 1 1/4-inch cabinet screws to connect them. Place screws behind where the hinges will be. This hides the screws from view once doors are installed. Remove clamps after screws are in.

*   Place the second cabinet next to the first.
*   Align their faces perfectly.
*   Clamp the face frames together.
*   Drill pilot holes through the joined face frames.
*   Drive cabinet screws to connect them.

Repeat this process for all remaining upper cabinets. Ensure each cabinet is level and plumb before joining it to the next. Continue screwing each cabinet into the wall studs. This method gives a solid, continuous run of cabinets.

## Securing and Leveling Base Cabinets

If your laundry room design includes base cabinets, their installation is similar but has some key differences. Base cabinets provide counter space and additional storage. They also require careful leveling to support a countertop properly.

I find that base cabinets are often easier to maneuver than wall cabinets. However, getting them perfectly level is critical for a good countertop fit. Pay close attention to this step.

### Position and Level Base Cabinets

Begin by positioning the first base cabinet. Place it where it will sit permanently. Check the cabinet for level from front to back and side to side. Use shims underneath the cabinet to raise low spots. Place shims under the cabinet's toe kick or base.

Work slowly to get it perfectly level. A slight tilt can cause issues when you install the countertop. If you have a long run of base cabinets, make sure they are all level with each other. This ensures a uniform countertop surface.

*   Set the first base cabinet in place.
*   Use a level to check front-to-back and side-to-side.
*   Insert shims under the cabinet base as needed.
*   Ensure the top surface is perfectly flat.

Continue to level each base cabinet as you set it. Connecting them together also helps maintain their alignment. This methodical approach gives you a professional result.

### Fasten Base Cabinets to the Wall

Once a base cabinet is level, secure it to the wall studs. Just like with upper cabinets, drill pilot holes through the cabinet's back frame into the studs. Use 2.5-inch wood screws for this. Place at least two screws per stud, one at the top and one at the bottom of the cabinet's back.

If you are joining multiple base cabinets, clamp their face frames together. Drill pilot holes through the joined frames and connect them with 1 1/4-inch cabinet screws. This creates a strong, unified unit. You may also need to account for gaps between cabinets. Knowing [how to fill a gap between two cabinets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fill-gap-between-two-cabinets) can be useful here.

Ensure screws are driven flush and do not protrude. This prevents damage to internal items or the wall. Verify that all cabinets are tightly secured to the wall and to each other. This creates a stable foundation for your laundry room's storage.

## Finishing Touches and Hardware Installation

You have done the hard work of installing the main cabinet boxes. Now it is time to add the final details. These steps make your cabinets look great and fully functional. They also protect your investment.

These finishing touches truly complete the project. I find this part very satisfying. It is where your vision truly comes to life. Do not rush these last steps.

### Install Doors, Drawers, and Hardware

Attach all cabinet doors and drawer fronts. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for hinge and drawer slide installation. Adjust hinges as needed to ensure doors hang straight and close properly. Drawer slides should allow drawers to open and close smoothly.

Install cabinet pulls or knobs. Measure carefully to ensure they are all at the same height and position on each door and drawer. A template can help with consistent placement. Drill pilot holes before screwing in hardware to prevent splitting.

*   Mount all cabinet doors.
*   Install drawer boxes and fronts.
*   Adjust hinges for proper alignment.
*   Measure and mark positions for pulls/knobs.
*   Drill pilot holes and attach hardware.

This step personalizes your cabinets. Choose hardware that matches your laundry room's style. I like to use a small piece of painter's tape to mark my drill points on cabinet doors. This prevents the drill bit from slipping.

### Add Filler Strips and Trim

If there are gaps between cabinets and walls, or between two cabinets, use filler strips. Measure the gap precisely. Cut the filler strip to size, ensuring a tight fit. Attach filler strips by screwing them from the inside of the cabinet through the side of the filler. This creates a finished look.

Install any decorative trim or molding, such as crown molding or toe kick trim. These pieces hide imperfections and give the cabinets a custom appearance. Measure and cut trim pieces accurately. Use small finishing nails or wood glue to attach them.

*   Measure gaps for filler strips.
*   Cut filler strips to fit.
*   Attach filler strips from inside the cabinet.
*   Install toe kick trim along the base.
*   Add any crown molding or decorative trim.

This step is essential for a polished outcome. Trim pieces hide unsightly gaps and seams. They make the cabinets look like they were custom-built for your space.

### Clean Up and Organize

Once everything is installed, clean the entire area. Wipe down your new cabinets. Remove any dust, sawdust, or pencil marks. You can refer to guides like [how to clean wood cabinets](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-wood-cabinets) for best practices.

Now, you can start organizing your laundry supplies inside your new cabinets. Place detergents, dryer sheets, and other items neatly. Enjoy your newly organized and functional laundry room. This is the reward for all your hard work.

Take pride in your finished project. You have successfully installed laundry room cabinets. This addition will make your laundry tasks more enjoyable and efficient.

## FAQ Section

### How much space do I need above my washer and dryer for cabinets?
You need at least 12-18 inches of clearance above most top-loading washing machines to open the lid fully. For front-loading machines, you can install cabinets closer, typically leaving 12-18 inches from the top of the machine to the bottom of the cabinet for comfortable access and utility connections. Always check your appliance's manual.

### Can I install laundry room cabinets by myself?
Yes, you can install laundry room cabinets alone, especially smaller units. However, it is much easier and safer with a helper. A second person helps lift heavy cabinets and hold them in place while you secure them. This ensures accuracy and reduces the risk of injury or damage.

### What is the standard depth for laundry room cabinets?
Standard upper laundry room cabinets are typically 12-13 inches deep. Base cabinets are usually 24 inches deep, to match standard kitchen cabinet depths and accommodate countertops. The depth you choose depends on what you plan to store and the available space in your laundry room.

### Do I need to remove baseboards before installing base cabinets?
Yes, you should remove baseboards before installing base cabinets. Baseboards create a gap between the wall and the cabinet. Removing them allows the cabinet to sit flush against the wall. This provides better stability and a cleaner finished appearance. You can reinstall the baseboards or new trim after the cabinets are in place.

### How do I ensure my cabinets are level and plumb?
Use a high-quality level frequently. Check for level both horizontally and vertically (plumb). Shims are small, tapered pieces of wood or plastic. Insert shims behind or under the cabinets at stud locations to fill gaps and make precise adjustments. Continue checking and adjusting until the cabinets are perfectly straight.
