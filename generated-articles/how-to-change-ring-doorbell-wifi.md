## Essential Preparations Before Changing Ring Doorbell Wi-Fi

Before you begin changing your Ring Doorbell's Wi-Fi settings, some preparation steps are very helpful. These steps ensure the process goes smoothly. They can prevent common frustrations and save you time. A little foresight can make a big difference.

First, identify your new Wi-Fi network's name (SSID) and password. These are case-sensitive, so write them down exactly as they appear. Double-check for any typos. This is the most frequent cause of connection failures. You can usually find this information on a sticker on your router, or in your router's administration interface. It is important to have these details ready.

Second, understand your Wi-Fi frequency. Most Ring Doorbells, especially older models, primarily use the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band. This band offers a wider range but slower speeds. Some newer Ring Pro and Elite models support 5 GHz Wi-Fi. The 5 GHz band provides faster speeds but has a shorter range and more difficulty penetrating walls. Verify which band your Ring Doorbell supports and ensure that band is active on your router. If your router broadcasts both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks with the same name, it is sometimes helpful to temporarily separate them. You can give them distinct names like "MyHomeWiFi_2.4GHz" and "MyHomeWiFi_5GHz." This allows you to specifically select the correct one.

Third, keep your mobile device charged and close to your Ring Doorbell. You will use your phone or tablet throughout the setup process. A low battery could interrupt the procedure. Proximity helps ensure a strong connection between your phone and the doorbell during the setup phase. Make sure you are logged into your Ring account on the app. Confirming your login credentials beforehand prevents delays. Lastly, if your doorbell is battery-powered, ensure its battery is fully charged. A weak battery might prevent the doorbell from entering setup mode or completing the connection process. If your battery-powered doorbell is having issues, learning [how to change Ring doorbell battery](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-ring-doorbell-battery) might be a useful read, as battery issues can sometimes mimic connectivity problems.

You will see a spinning white light on the front of your doorbell, indicating it is in setup mode. Now, exit the Ring app and go to your phone's Wi-Fi settings. Look for a Wi-Fi network named "Ring-" followed by some numbers or letters. Connect your phone to this "Ring-" network. It is a temporary connection, not your home Wi-Fi.

After connecting your phone to the "Ring-" network, return to the Ring app. The app should automatically detect the connection. It will then prompt you to select your home Wi-Fi network from a list of available networks. Choose your new or updated Wi-Fi network's name (SSID) from this list. Carefully enter your Wi-Fi password when prompted. Remember, passwords are case-sensitive. Once you enter the password, the Ring app will attempt to connect your doorbell to the chosen network. This can take a few moments. Your doorbell's light ring will usually flash blue and then turn solid white when successfully connected. Finally, the app will confirm the successful connection. Your Ring Doorbell is now back online and ready to protect your home. This streamlined process makes changing your Ring doorbell Wi-Fi quite manageable for most users.

## Specific Steps for Different Ring Doorbell Models

While the general process to change Ring Doorbell Wi-Fi is consistent, putting each model into setup mode differs slightly. Knowing where to find the setup button is key. This section details the specifics for common Ring Doorbell models. Pay close attention to your specific device.

### Battery-Powered Ring Doorbells (e.g., Ring Video Doorbell 1st/2nd Gen, 2, 3, 4, Peephole Cam)

These models are the most common. They run on a removable, rechargeable battery pack. To put them into setup mode, you will use a physical button. Look for a small orange or black button on the side or back of the doorbell. For the original Ring Video Doorbell and Ring Video Doorbell 2, this button is on the upper right side. For the Ring Video Doorbell 3 and 4, the button is located just beneath the faceplate, which you usually remove by unscrewing the security screws at the bottom. The Ring Peephole Cam has a button on its side. Press and release this button firmly. You will know it is in setup mode when the light ring on the front of the doorbell starts spinning white. This indicates it is broadcasting its temporary setup network. Ensure your battery is charged, as a low battery might prevent it from entering setup mode.

### Wired Ring Doorbells (e.g., Ring Video Doorbell Wired, Pro, Pro 2, Elite)

Wired Ring Doorbells draw power directly from your existing doorbell wiring. They do not have a battery. The setup button location varies slightly among these models. For the Ring Video Doorbell Wired, the setup button is a small, round button on the front of the device, above the camera. The Ring Video Doorbell Pro has a small black button on the right side of the unit. The Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 features a small button on its left side. For all these models, press and release this button. The light ring on the front of the doorbell will begin flashing blue. This indicates it has entered setup mode.

The Ring Video Doorbell Elite is a unique case. It uses Power over Ethernet (PoE) for power and internet connection. Its setup button is a small, round button on the front, located near the top. Press and release this button. The Elite's light ring will also flash blue to signal setup mode.

If you find your [why won't Ring doorbell connect to Wi-Fi](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-ring-doorbell-connect-to-wifi) even after these steps, there might be deeper issues with your home network.

### Can't Find Ring Setup Network

After putting your doorbell into setup mode, your phone should see a "Ring-" Wi-Fi network. If it doesn't appear, try moving your phone closer to the doorbell. Sometimes, the temporary network's signal is not very strong. Wait a few moments; it can take up to a minute for the network to broadcast. Ensure your phone's Wi-Fi is turned on. Temporarily disable your phone's mobile data connection. Some phones prioritize mobile data, which can prevent them from seeing or connecting to local Wi-Fi networks like the Ring setup network. If you have a Wi-Fi extender, temporarily disable it and try again. Extenders can sometimes interfere with direct device connections during setup.

### Incorrect Password or Network Not Found

This issue often occurs after you select your home Wi-Fi network. Double-check the network name (SSID) and password. These are case-sensitive. Even a single incorrect character or a misplaced space can prevent a connection. Confirm you are connecting to the correct network; if you have both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks, ensure you pick the one compatible with your Ring Doorbell (usually 2.4 GHz). If your network name has special characters, try simplifying it temporarily if your router allows. Restart your home router and modem. This refreshes your network and can resolve many connectivity problems. Wait a few minutes for your network to fully restart before trying again.

### Weak Signal After Reconnecting

Your doorbell might connect but show a weak signal in Device Health. This leads to poor performance, such as delayed notifications or grainy video. Weak signal is usually due to distance from the router or interference. Consider relocating your router if possible, or moving it away from large metal objects or other electronics. These can block Wi-Fi signals. You might also need a Wi-Fi extender, such as a Ring Chime Pro. This device boosts your Wi-Fi signal specifically for your Ring devices. For more general Ring network issues, exploring why your [Ring doorbell won't connect to Wi-Fi](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-ring-doorbell-wont-connect-to-wifi) can provide additional troubleshooting insights. Persistent weak signals often require optimizing your home network layout.

## Optimizing Your Ring Doorbell's Wi-Fi Performance

Once your Ring Doorbell is successfully connected to its new Wi-Fi network, you want to ensure it performs at its best. A strong and stable Wi-Fi connection is key to reliable operation. Optimizing your network setup can significantly improve your doorbell's responsiveness, video quality, and notification speed. Taking a few extra steps now can prevent future headaches.

One of the most impactful optimizations is router placement. Your Wi-Fi router should be as close as possible to your Ring Doorbell. Walls, especially those made of brick, concrete, or with metal studs, can severely degrade Wi-Fi signals. Large appliances like refrigerators or washing machines can also cause interference. Try to place your router in a central location in your home, unobstructed, and ideally on a higher shelf. This maximizes signal spread and minimizes obstacles between the router and your doorbell. Every foot and every obstacle reduce signal strength.

Minimizing interference from other electronic devices is another important step. Cordless phones, microwaves, and even some smart home devices can operate on the same 2.4 GHz frequency as your Ring Doorbell. This can cause congestion and slower performance. If you suspect interference, try moving these devices away from your router or doorbell. Ensure your router is on an optimal Wi-Fi channel. Many routers have an auto-select feature, but sometimes manually choosing a less congested channel (like 1, 6, or 11 for 2.4 GHz) can improve stability.

Consider using a Ring Chime Pro if your doorbell is far from your router or experiences consistent weak signals. The Chime Pro acts as a Wi-Fi extender specifically designed for Ring devices. It strengthens the Wi-Fi signal to your doorbell, improving connectivity and overall performance. It also acts as an indoor chime, which is a nice bonus. Another strategy is to dedicate a 2.4 GHz network for your smart home devices. If your router broadcasts both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks with the same name, consider splitting them into separate SSIDs. This ensures your doorbell connects to the 2.4 GHz band, which offers better range and wall penetration.

Finally, regularly check for firmware updates for your Ring Doorbell. Ring frequently releases updates to improve performance and fix bugs. You can find information about available updates in the "Device Health" section of the Ring app. Keeping your doorbell's firmware updated ensures it has the latest enhancements for Wi-Fi connectivity. These optimization tips help your Ring Doorbell function optimally. You will enjoy consistent performance and dependable security.

The most immediate effect is that your Ring Doorbell will go offline. This means it can no longer connect to the internet or the Ring cloud. You will lose all real-time functionality. You won't receive motion alerts when someone approaches your door. The live view feature will also become unavailable. If a visitor presses the doorbell button, you won't get a notification on your phone or tablet. This renders the doorbell's primary purpose, which is to alert you to activity at your front door, completely ineffective. Essentially, your smart doorbell transforms into a standard, non-connected button.

Furthermore, your Ring Doorbell will stop recording events. Any motion detection or doorbell presses will not be captured and stored in the cloud. If you rely on your Ring device for security footage, this is a major drawback. You will have no record of visitors or suspicious activity. This impacts your home security significantly. If you are wondering about the full scope of what your device is capable of, understanding [what is Ring Doorbell used for](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-ring-doorbell-used-for) can help you appreciate the features you are missing when disconnected.

Your Ring Doorbell's features, like two-way talk, Quick Replies, and integration with other Ring devices, will also cease to function. These smart capabilities depend entirely on a live internet connection. Without Wi-Fi, the doorbell cannot access the internet to communicate these functions. You won't be able to speak to visitors remotely, and any pre-recorded messages won't activate. Even simple tasks like checking the device's battery level or signal strength in the app become impossible. The app will simply show the doorbell as "offline."

In essence, a Ring Doorbell that is not connected to Wi-Fi is a passive device. It loses all its smart security and convenience features. It cannot provide you with peace of mind or protection. Promptly updating its Wi-Fi settings ensures you maintain full functionality and continuous home monitoring. It is a vital step to keep your smart home security ecosystem operating effectively.
