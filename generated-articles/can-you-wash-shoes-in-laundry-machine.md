## Can You Wash Shoes In A Laundry Machine? A Complete Guide

Have you ever looked at your dirty shoes and wondered if throwing them in the washing machine is a good idea? It is a common question. Many people struggle with keeping their footwear clean. Hand-washing shoes takes a lot of effort and time.

I understand the desire for an easier cleaning solution. The good news is that you can often wash shoes in a laundry machine. However, it is not always a simple yes or no answer. Different shoe materials and styles require different care. This article will help you understand which shoes are safe to machine wash. I will also share the best methods for a successful clean. We will cover preparing your shoes, the washing process, and proper drying techniques. My aim is to make your shoe cleaning routine simpler and more effective.

### Takeaway

*   **Assess Shoe Material:** Only machine wash shoes made of canvas, cotton, nylon, or synthetic materials.
*   **Prepare Properly:** Remove laces and insoles. Brush off loose dirt. Place shoes in a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Protect Your Machine:** Wash shoes with old towels to cushion them and reduce noise.
*   **Use Cold Water & Gentle Cycle:** This prevents damage and shrinkage.
*   **Air Dry Always:** Never put shoes in the dryer, as heat can warp materials and melt adhesives.

Can you wash shoes in a laundry machine? Yes, you can wash many types of shoes in a laundry machine, but it depends on the shoe material. Always check care labels if available. Use a gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent. Air drying is essential to prevent damage.

## Types of Shoes That Can Handle Machine Washing

Many shoes are good candidates for machine washing. I often machine wash my athletic shoes. Shoes made from canvas, cotton, nylon, or other synthetic fabrics usually do well. These materials are durable and hold up to water and mild detergents. Think about your running shoes, most sneakers, and casual canvas shoes.

For example, I regularly clean my tennis shoes this way. They get dirty quickly with outdoor use. Machine washing helps keep them fresh. [How to wash tennis shoes in machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-tennis-shoes-in-machine) explains this in more detail. Shoes like Hey Dude and Kizik are also designed for easy machine washing. Brands often state this on their websites. This makes cleaning simple and convenient for daily wear.

Some water shoes can also be machine washed. Water shoes are often made from quick-drying synthetic materials. They are built to withstand getting wet. However, always check the specific care instructions for your pair. It is important to know if your shoes can handle the machine's agitation. Overall, if your shoe is soft-sided, flexible, and made of common synthetic fabrics, it is likely safe.

## Shoes That Should Never Go In Your Washing Machine

While many shoes can go in the washer, some should absolutely not. Putting the wrong shoes in your laundry machine can cause serious damage. I learned this the hard way with a pair of my favorite boots. Leather and suede shoes are a big no-go. Water can stain, stiffen, and crack leather. Machine washing will ruin their texture and appearance.

[Can you machine wash leather shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-machine-wash-leather-shoes) explains why this is a bad idea. Shoes with delicate embellishments, such as beads, sequins, or embroidery, will not survive the wash cycle. These parts can easily break off or unravel. Shoes with glued-on elements, like rhinestones or patches, may also fall apart. The strong agitation and water can dissolve adhesives.

Boots, especially those made for hiking or work, are also generally not machine washable. They often have stiff components, metal eyelets, or specific waterproof coatings. These features can get damaged in the machine. High heels and dress shoes are another category to avoid. They have structured designs and delicate materials that are not meant for machine washing. Always consider the materials and construction before you decide to machine wash any pair of shoes.

## Essential Preparation Before Washing Shoes

Before you even think about putting your shoes in the laundry machine, some preparation is key. This step helps protect your shoes and your washing machine. First, I always remove the laces and insoles from my shoes. The laces can get tangled around the agitator, and insoles need separate attention. I often hand-wash laces or put them in a small mesh bag.

Next, it is important to remove any loose dirt, mud, or debris from the shoes. I use an old brush or a paper towel for this. You do not want large chunks of dirt clogging your machine's drain. For particularly smelly shoes, addressing the odor before washing can help.

This pre-cleaning step prevents more dirt from getting into your washer.

Then, place your shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag keeps the shoes together and protects them from harsh tumbling. It also prevents small parts, like lace hooks, from snagging the machine drum. If you do not have a mesh bag, an old pillowcase tied securely will work. Lastly, gather a few old towels. These towels will go into the washer with your shoes. They act as a cushion, stopping the shoes from banging around too much. This protects both your shoes and your machine.

## Simple Steps To Machine Wash Your Shoes Safely

Once your shoes are prepared, the actual washing process is straightforward. First, load your prepared shoes into the washing machine. Remember to include 2-3 old towels. These towels balance the load and prevent excessive banging. I find this significantly reduces the noise and protects my machine.

Next, add your laundry detergent. Use a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Powdered detergents can sometimes leave residue on shoes. [Is laundry detergent good for cleaning shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-laundry-detergent-good-for-cleaning-shoes) discusses detergent choices further. Avoid harsh bleaches or strong stain removers unless the shoe material specifically allows it. Less is often more when washing shoes.

Now, select the right wash cycle. Choose the "delicate" or "gentle" cycle setting. This cycle uses less agitation, which is safer for your shoes. Always use cold water. Hot water can cause shoes to shrink, warp, or even damage adhesives. I make sure to double-check the water temperature setting. Spin speed should be set to low or no spin if possible. This minimizes stress on the shoes. Start the wash cycle and let the machine do its work. Different washing machines might have slightly different settings. For example, [Can you wash shoes in LG washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-shoes-in-lg-washing-machine) might have specific cycle names.

## Proper Drying Techniques For Washed Shoes

After your shoes come out of the washing machine, proper drying is critical. This is where many people make a mistake. Never put your shoes in the dryer. The heat from a clothes dryer can cause significant damage. It can melt the glue that holds your shoes together. Heat can also shrink or warp the materials, especially synthetic parts and rubber soles. This will ruin the fit and appearance of your shoes. I always air dry my shoes.

The best way to dry shoes is to air dry them. Take them out of the mesh bag immediately after the wash cycle. Remove the insoles if you put them back in. Open up the shoes as much as possible. You can stuff them with crumpled newspaper or paper towels. This helps absorb moisture from the inside and helps the shoes keep their shape as they dry. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. A spot with good airflow, like near an open window or outside on a sunny day, is ideal. Avoid direct sunlight for prolonged periods, as it can sometimes fade colors. I often place mine on a shoe rack on my porch. Drying can take anywhere from several hours to a couple of days, depending on the shoe material and humidity. Be patient and ensure they are completely dry before wearing them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to unpleasant odors and mildew.

## Common Mistakes To Avoid When Washing Shoes

Even with the right intentions, people make mistakes when machine washing shoes. Avoiding these errors ensures your shoes come out clean and intact. One common mistake is not pre-cleaning the shoes. Leaving large clumps of mud or dirt on your shoes can clog your washing machine's drain or leave residue. Always brush off loose debris first.

Another error is using hot water or a strong wash cycle. Hot water and aggressive agitation are enemies of many shoe materials. They can cause shrinking, fading, or damage to adhesives. Always stick to cold water and a gentle cycle. Some people also forget to add towels to the wash. Without towels, shoes can bang around violently in the drum. This creates loud noise and risks damaging both the shoes and the machine. The towels provide cushioning and balance.

Overfilling the washing machine is also a mistake. Do not try to wash too many pairs at once. This prevents proper cleaning and can strain your machine. Wash only one or two pairs at a time, along with the towels. Lastly, and most importantly, using a clothes dryer is a major mistake. As I mentioned, heat damages shoes significantly. Always air dry your shoes to preserve their shape and materials. Paying attention to these simple details makes a big difference in the outcome.

## Extending Shoe Life Through Regular Care

Machine washing can clean your shoes, but regular care helps them last even longer. Maintaining your shoes between washes keeps them looking good and prevents excessive dirt buildup. I try to wipe my shoes down after each wear, especially if I have been outside. A quick brush or damp cloth can remove surface dirt before it sets in. This proactive approach means less deep cleaning later.

Proper storage also plays a role in shoe longevity. Store your shoes in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. This prevents material breakdown and color fading. Shoe trees or stuffing shoes with paper can help them maintain their shape when not in use. This is particularly useful for shoes you do not wear often.

Rotating your shoes helps too. Wearing the same pair every day puts a lot of stress on them. Giving shoes a break allows them to air out completely and recover their shape. This practice also extends the life of each pair. Addressing small issues quickly, like loose laces or minor scuffs, can prevent them from becoming bigger problems. For white shoes, specific cleaning methods can keep them bright.

By combining smart machine washing with consistent maintenance, you can enjoy your favorite shoes for a much longer time.
