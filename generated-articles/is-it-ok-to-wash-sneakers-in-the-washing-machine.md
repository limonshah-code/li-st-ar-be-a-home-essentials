## Is It Ok To Wash Sneakers In The Washing Machine?

Have you ever looked at your dirty sneakers and wondered if the washing machine is a good idea? Many of us ask this exact question. It seems like an easy solution for grimy shoes. Knowing the right way to **wash sneakers in the washing machine** can save you time and keep your favorite footwear looking new.

This guide will explain everything you need to know. We will cover preparing your shoes, choosing the correct settings, and drying them properly. By following these steps, you can confidently clean your sneakers. This article helps you decide when to machine wash and when to use other methods. For example, some people wonder if [you can wash sneakers in the dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-sneakers-in-the-dishwasher) for a quick clean. We focus on the washing machine method here.

### Takeaway:

*   Most fabric sneakers are safe for machine washing with proper preparation.
*   Always remove laces and insoles before washing.
*   Use a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent.
*   Air dry sneakers away from direct heat to prevent damage.
*   Do not machine wash leather, suede, or delicate shoes.

Yes, it is generally okay to wash sneakers in the washing machine, but with important caveats. You must follow specific steps to protect your shoes and your machine. Not all sneakers are suitable for machine washing. Proper preparation and gentle settings are key for good results.

## Understanding Which Sneakers Are Safe for Machine Washing

It's important to know which types of sneakers can handle a washing machine cycle. Not every pair of shoes will survive this kind of cleaning. Certain materials react poorly to water and agitation. I always check the shoe's material first.

Most sneakers made from canvas, cotton, nylon, or synthetic fabrics are generally safe. These materials are sturdy and can withstand machine washing without falling apart. Many running shoes or everyday trainers fit this description. You can usually tell by looking at the label inside the shoe or on the box.

However, shoes made from leather, suede, silk, or satin are not suitable. Water can stain leather and suede, causing them to shrink or crack. Delicate fabrics might tear or lose their shape. Shoes with embellishments like beads, sequins, or intricate stitching should also stay out of the washer. These items can detach or snag during a wash cycle.

When in doubt, it is always better to hand wash. A gentle hand wash protects delicate materials. It ensures your shoes last longer. Always prioritize the shoe's material over convenience to avoid damage.

## Essential Steps for Preparing Your Sneakers for Washing

Proper preparation is the most important step before you **wash sneakers in the washing machine**. Skipping these steps can lead to damaged shoes or even a damaged washing machine. I always take my time with this part. It makes a big difference in the final outcome.

First, remove the laces and insoles from your sneakers. The laces can tangle in the machine, and they often need separate cleaning. Insoles absorb a lot of foot odor and moisture. Washing them separately allows for a more thorough clean. You can hand wash insoles with soap and water, then let them air dry.

Next, remove any large chunks of dirt or mud. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush to scrub away loose debris from the soles and sides. You can also knock the shoes together outside to dislodge dirt. This prevents dirt from clogging your washing machine's drain. It also means your wash water stays cleaner.

Place your sneakers and laces into a mesh laundry bag. This protects them from harsh tumbling during the wash cycle. It also prevents the shoes from banging around inside the machine. If you do not have a mesh bag, an old pillowcase tied shut works too. Adding a few old towels to the wash helps cushion the shoes. This reduces noise and protects both your shoes and your machine.

## Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings for Sneakers

Selecting the correct washing machine settings is crucial for a successful and safe wash. Using the wrong settings can damage your sneakers or even your machine. I pay close attention to this part to get the best results.

Always opt for a gentle cycle. This setting uses less agitation and a slower spin speed. A delicate or hand wash cycle is ideal for most sneakers. It mimics a gentle hand wash, which is much safer for footwear. High-speed cycles can cause shoes to bang against the drum. This can harm the shoes' structure and make a lot of noise.

Use cold water only. Hot water can cause certain materials to shrink, fade colors, or melt adhesives. Many sneakers use glues that can break down under high heat. Cold water is effective enough for cleaning dirt and grime. It also helps preserve the shoe's original shape and color.

Choose a mild laundry detergent. Avoid harsh bleaches or strong stain removers. These chemicals can be too aggressive for sneaker materials. A small amount of liquid detergent is usually sufficient. You can also use a detergent specifically designed for delicate items. Add less detergent than you would for a full load of clothes. Too much soap can leave residue on your shoes.

## Effective Cleaning Products and Pre-Treatment Tips

Even with the right machine settings, sometimes your sneakers need a little extra help. Using the right cleaning products and pre-treatment methods can tackle stubborn stains. I often pre-treat my shoes for better results.

For tough spots, pre-treat them before placing the sneakers in the washer. Apply a small amount of laundry detergent directly onto the stain. You can also use a stain remover designed for fabrics. Gently rub the area with an old toothbrush or a soft cloth. Let the pre-treatment sit for about 15-30 minutes. This allows the cleaner to break down the dirt and grime effectively.

Baking soda can also work wonders for odors and mild stains. Make a paste with baking soda and a small amount of water. Apply it to the affected areas and let it sit for a while before washing. This helps neutralize odors and lift surface dirt. For particularly smelly insoles, a sprinkle of baking soda left overnight can refresh them before hand washing.

When washing, remember to use a mild liquid detergent. Powdered detergents sometimes leave a white residue, especially on dark-colored shoes. Liquid detergent dissolves better in cold water and rinses away more completely. Avoid fabric softeners; they can leave a film on the shoe materials. Keep it simple to protect your sneakers and ensure they come out clean.

## Drying Your Sneakers Properly After Washing

Washing your sneakers is only half the battle; proper drying is just as important. Incorrect drying methods can cause shrinkage, material damage, or unpleasant odors. I always air dry my shoes to ensure they last.

Never put your sneakers in the dryer. The high heat from a clothes dryer can melt glues, warp plastic components, and shrink fabrics. It can also cause rubber soles to detach. The tumbling action can damage both the shoes and the dryer itself. This is a common mistake people make.

The best way to dry your sneakers is by air drying them. Start by stuffing the inside of each shoe with paper towels or clean, white cloths. This helps absorb moisture and maintains the shoe's shape as it dries. Avoid using colored paper or newspaper, as the ink can transfer to your shoes. Change the paper every few hours if the shoes are very wet.

Place your stuffed sneakers in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat. A porch, a room with an open window, or near a fan works well. Drying can take 12-24 hours, depending on the shoe material and humidity. Be patient. Ensure your shoes are completely dry before wearing them. Putting on damp shoes can lead to mold, mildew, and bad smells. For different cleaning options, some people even ask if [you can wash sneakers in the dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-sneakers-in-the-dishwasher) when looking for quick alternatives.

## When Not to Use the Washing Machine for Sneakers

While machine washing is convenient, it is not always the best choice for every pair of sneakers. Knowing when to avoid the washing machine can save your shoes from permanent damage. I always consider the risks before putting shoes in the washer.

You should never machine wash sneakers made from delicate materials. This includes leather, suede, silk, satin, or other sensitive fabrics. These materials can get damaged by water and agitation. Leather can crack or warp, and suede can become stiff and discolored. Embellished shoes with sequins, beads, or other decorations are also too fragile for the washing machine. These small parts can fall off or get caught in the machine.

Hand-painted or custom-designed sneakers should also stay out of the washer. The paint or artwork might fade, chip, or wash away. Athletic shoes with advanced technology, like air pockets or complex sole structures, might also be at risk. The intense movements of a washing machine can compromise their specialized features. When you consider cleaning options, it's worth noting some methods are less common but still discussed. For instance, some wonder, [can you wash sneakers in the dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-wash-sneakers-in-the-dishwasher)? However, for delicate sneakers, manual spot cleaning is always the safest bet.

If you are unsure about a shoe's material or construction, err on the side of caution. Spot clean visible dirt with a damp cloth and mild soap. This gentler approach helps preserve the shoe's integrity. Always choose the method that best protects your specific footwear.

## Tips for Keeping Your Sneakers Clean Longer

Keeping your sneakers clean is easier with a few proactive habits. Prevention is key to extending the time between deep cleans. I use these tips to maintain my shoes' freshness.

Regularly wipe down your sneakers after each wear. Use a damp cloth to remove surface dirt and dust. This simple action prevents grime from building up and becoming tough stains. A quick wipe only takes a minute. It helps a lot in the long run.

Use shoe protectors or water-repellent sprays. Many products create a barrier on your shoes. This barrier helps repel water, stains, and dirt. Apply these sprays to new shoes or after a deep clean. Always follow the product instructions for best results. This added layer of protection keeps your shoes looking cleaner for longer.

Store your sneakers properly. When you are not wearing them, keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or damp areas. Stuffing them with shoe trees or acid-free paper helps maintain their shape. Proper storage prevents dust buildup and protects materials. It also helps them air out, reducing odors.

Rotating your shoes can also extend their lifespan. Do not wear the same pair of sneakers every day. Giving shoes a break allows them to fully dry and air out. This reduces wear and tear and keeps them fresher. Using these simple habits will help you enjoy your sneakers for many more wears.
