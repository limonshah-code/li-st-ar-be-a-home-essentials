### Why Isn't My LG Dryer Heating Up?

Your LG dryer isn't heating up most often due to a lack of power, restricted airflow, or a broken internal component. Common culprits include a tripped circuit breaker, a clogged vent, a faulty heating element, or a blown thermal fuse.

### Check Your Power Supply: Electrical Basics for Your LG Dryer

Your LG dryer needs a strong power supply to generate heat. Dryers typically use a 240-volt circuit. This is different from most other home appliances. A problem with this power supply will directly affect the dryer's ability to warm up. We often overlook simple electrical checks. However, they can save you time and money.

#### Circuit Breaker Trips

A tripped circuit breaker is a common reason for a dryer not heating up. The dryer draws a lot of power. This can sometimes cause the breaker to trip. Check your home's main electrical panel. You might see a breaker in the "off" or "tripped" position. Resetting it might restore power to your dryer's heating function.

First, locate your circuit breaker box. Then, find the breaker marked for your dryer. It might be a double breaker, meaning two switches are tied together. If it is tripped, it will be in the middle position. Push it firmly to the "off" position first. Then, push it back to the "on" position. If it immediately trips again, a deeper electrical issue exists. This issue requires a qualified electrician.

#### Outlet Problems

The wall outlet itself can be a source of trouble. Sometimes, the outlet may lose power on one of its two lines. Your dryer can still tumble and light up in this situation. However, it will not heat if it only receives 120 volts instead of the full 240. You can test the outlet with a voltage meter. This tool confirms if it provides full power.

If you do not have a voltage meter, you can try plugging in another 240-volt appliance. This might be difficult for many homes. Alternatively, you can try plugging your dryer into a different 240-volt outlet if one is available. Make sure the outlet itself has power. This helps rule out problems with your home's electrical wiring. Always use caution when dealing with electrical outlets. Ensure you unplug the dryer before any checks.

### Clear the Airflow: Ventilation Issues Stopping LG Dryer Heat

Proper airflow is vital for your dryer to heat and dry clothes efficiently. If air cannot move freely, heat builds up inside the dryer. This can trigger safety devices, which then cut off the heat. Blocked vents are a leading cause of dryers not heating correctly. They also pose a fire risk. Regular cleaning prevents these problems.

#### Clogged Lint Trap

The lint trap catches loose fibers from your clothes. It sits inside the dryer door opening. A full lint trap severely restricts airflow. This makes your dryer work harder and reduces its heating ability. You should clean the lint trap after every single load. This simple habit keeps your dryer running efficiently.

To clean it, pull the screen out. Then, use your fingers to peel off the accumulated lint. Some dryers also have a secondary filter or a lint trap housing that can get clogged deeper down. Periodically, you might need to vacuum out this area. You can use a thin vacuum attachment. A clean lint trap ensures maximum airflow. This allows the heating element to function without overheating.

#### Blocked Dryer Vent

Beyond the lint trap, the entire dryer vent system can become blocked. This includes the flexible hose behind the dryer, the rigid ducts inside your walls, and the vent hood outside your home. Lint builds up in these areas over time. This restricts hot, moist air from escaping. When this happens, the dryer's thermostat may sense excess heat and shut off the heating element.

First, disconnect the dryer from the wall outlet. Then, pull the dryer away from the wall. Inspect the flexible vent hose. Look for kinks, crushes, or heavy lint buildup. Clean the hose thoroughly. You can use a brush made for dryer vents. Also, check the vent opening on your outside wall. Make sure the flap opens freely and no lint clogs it. A blocked vent can cause your dryer to run but not heat. For more details on cleaning your dryer, refer to our guide on [how to clean LG dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-dryer).

### The Heart of the Heat: Inspecting the LG Dryer's Heating Element

The heating element is the main component that generates heat in an electric dryer. It is essentially a large coil that gets hot when electricity passes through it. If this part breaks, your dryer will tumble and run. However, it will not produce any heat. A broken heating element is a very common reason for an LG dryer not heating up.

You can usually find the heating element at the back of the dryer. It is typically housed in a metal casing. To access it, you first need to unplug the dryer. Then, you might need to remove the back panel of the appliance. Be careful during this process. Inside, you will see the heating coil.

Visually inspect the coil. Look for any breaks, burns, or dark spots. A healthy heating element should look intact. If you see a visible break in the coil, it needs replacement. Even without a visible break, the element might be faulty.

To confirm the issue, you can use a multimeter. Set the multimeter to measure ohms (resistance). Disconnect the dryer's power. Then, disconnect the two wires connected to the heating element terminals. Place one probe from the multimeter on each terminal. A working heating element will show a resistance reading. This is usually between 7 and 15 ohms. If the multimeter shows an "OL" (open loop) or an infinite reading, the element is broken. This means electricity cannot flow through it. Replacing a faulty heating element requires careful work. You must match the new part exactly to your LG model. A broken heating element is a direct cause of your LG dryer not heating. If your LG dryer runs but does not heat, the heating element is a prime suspect.

### Safety First: Understanding LG Dryer Thermal Fuses

Every LG dryer has a thermal fuse. This is a safety device. It protects your dryer from overheating. The thermal fuse is a small, non-resetting component. It breaks the electrical circuit when the dryer gets too hot. Once it blows, it cannot be reset. You must replace it to restore power to the heating circuit.

The thermal fuse is typically located near the blower wheel housing or on the exhaust duct. It is a small white or gray component with two wires attached. A common reason for a thermal fuse to blow is restricted airflow. This can come from a clogged lint trap or a blocked dryer vent. If your dryer vent is obstructed, heat builds up inside. The thermal fuse activates to prevent a fire.

To check the thermal fuse, first unplug the dryer. Then, locate the fuse. Disconnect the wires connected to it. Use a multimeter to test for continuity. Set the multimeter to the continuity setting (often indicated by a sound or a specific symbol). Place one probe on each terminal of the fuse. A working fuse will show continuity. This means the circuit is closed. Your multimeter might beep or show a reading close to zero ohms.

If the multimeter shows no continuity, the thermal fuse is blown. You must replace it. When replacing a thermal fuse, also check for the root cause of the overheating. This usually involves clearing out the dryer vents and lint trap. Replacing the fuse without fixing the underlying problem will cause the new fuse to blow quickly. This is an important step if your LG dryer isn't heating up. Remember, this fuse is a one-time use safety device.

### Temperature Regulators: Cycling and High-Limit Thermostats

LG dryers use different thermostats to control and monitor temperature. These components ensure the dryer operates within safe temperature ranges. They play a crucial role in the heating process. If a thermostat fails, it can prevent your dryer from heating.

#### Cycling Thermostat

The cycling thermostat controls the dryer's temperature during operation. It turns the heating element on and off to maintain the selected temperature setting. If this thermostat fails, it can remain open. This prevents the heating element from receiving power. Or, it might stay closed, causing the dryer to overheat (though this is less common for a "no heat" issue).

You usually find the cycling thermostat on the blower housing or near the heating element. It has two terminals for wires. To test it, unplug the dryer. Disconnect the wires from the thermostat. Use a multimeter set to continuity mode. Place one probe on each terminal. A functional cycling thermostat should show continuity when at room temperature. If it shows no continuity, it is faulty and needs replacement.

#### High-Limit Thermostat

The high-limit thermostat is another safety device. It prevents the dryer from reaching dangerously high temperatures. It is often located very close to the heating element. If the temperature exceeds a safe limit, this thermostat trips. It then cuts power to the heating element. Unlike the thermal fuse, some high-limit thermostats are resettable. Others are not.

To check the high-limit thermostat, unplug the dryer. Disconnect its wires. Use a multimeter to test for continuity across its terminals. A working high-limit thermostat should show continuity at room temperature. If it shows no continuity, it has tripped or failed. If it is resettable, try pressing a small button on its body. If it is not resettable and shows no continuity, replace it. High-limit thermostat failures often point to airflow problems. Make sure to clean vents when replacing this part.

Both cycling and high-limit thermostats are vital. A malfunction in either can directly cause your LG dryer not heating up. Replacing them requires care and correct part matching.

### Motor and Blower Wheel: Essential for Air Movement and Heat Distribution

While the motor and blower wheel do not directly create heat, they are essential for distributing it. The motor powers both the drum and the blower wheel. The blower wheel draws air into the dryer and pushes hot, moist air out through the vent. If either of these parts fails, your dryer will run. However, it will not heat effectively.

#### Defective Dryer Motor

The dryer motor is responsible for turning the drum and driving the blower wheel. If the motor is weak or faulty, it might still turn the drum. However, it may not generate enough power for the blower wheel to move air effectively. Without proper airflow, the heating element can overheat and shut off. Or, the hot air cannot circulate to dry clothes.

Symptoms of a failing motor can include a humming sound without the drum turning. You might also hear the dryer running but notice very little air coming out of the exhaust vent. Testing a motor typically involves checking its windings with a multimeter for continuity and resistance. This can be a complex repair. It often requires professional help.

#### Broken Blower Wheel

The blower wheel is a fan-like component. It pulls air through the heating element and pushes it out of the dryer. If the blower wheel is cracked, broken, or clogged with lint, it cannot move air properly. This leads to poor heat distribution and potentially triggers safety cut-offs. Even if the heating element works, clothes will not dry. This happens because the hot air does not reach them.

To inspect the blower wheel, you usually need to access the dryer's back panel or bottom. Unplug the dryer before you start. Look for any damage to the fan blades. Check for heavy lint buildup around the wheel. Clear any obstructions. If the wheel is broken, you must replace it. A faulty blower wheel results in your LG dryer running but not heating clothes. This is because no air carries the heat through the drum.

Ensuring these components work correctly is vital for your dryer's heating efficiency. Issues with the motor or blower wheel are less common for a "no heat" symptom compared to heating elements or fuses. Still, they are important to check if other solutions fail.
