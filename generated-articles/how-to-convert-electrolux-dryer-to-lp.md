## Step-by-Step Guide to Convert Electrolux Dryer to LP

Converting your Electrolux dryer to LP gas is a detailed task. It requires careful attention to each step. Follow these instructions precisely to ensure a safe and successful conversion. I will guide you through each part of the process.

### Safety First: Preparing for Conversion

Before touching anything, prioritize safety. This step is non-negotiable.

1.  **Disconnect Power:** Unplug your Electrolux dryer from the electrical outlet.
2.  **Shut Off Gas Supply:** Locate the main gas shut-off valve for your dryer. This valve is usually a quarter-turn valve on the gas line behind the dryer. Turn it to the "off" position. This stops the flow of natural gas.
3.  **Ventilation:** Open windows or doors for good airflow. Gas work should always happen in a well-ventilated area.
4.  **Clear Area:** Ensure no open flames or ignition sources are near.

These steps prevent accidents like electric shock or gas leaks. Skipping any of them is dangerous.

### Disconnecting Natural Gas

Now that safety precautions are in place, you can disconnect the gas line.

1.  **Locate Gas Line:** Find the flexible gas line connecting your dryer to the wall supply.
2.  **Unscrew Connection:** Use an adjustable wrench to carefully loosen the nut connecting the flexible gas line to the dryer's gas inlet pipe.
3.  **Remove Line:** Once loose, fully unscrew the gas line. Be careful, as a small amount of residual gas might escape.
4.  **Cap Off Line:** Cap the gas supply line coming from the wall. This prevents any gas from leaking while you work.

This step frees the dryer for access to its internal gas components. It also isolates the gas supply.

### Replacing the Orifice

The orifice is a tiny but critical component. It controls the gas flow to the burner.

1.  **Access Burner Assembly:** You will need to remove the front or rear panel of your Electrolux dryer to reach the burner assembly. Refer to your dryer's service manual for exact panel removal instructions. Screws hold these panels in place.
2.  **Locate Orifice:** The orifice is typically a small brass fitting at the end of the gas valve, inside the burner tube.
3.  **Remove Natural Gas Orifice:** Use a small wrench or nut driver to unscrew the existing natural gas orifice. It might be tight. Keep this old part in case you ever need to convert back.
4.  **Install LP Orifice:** Carefully screw in the new LP orifice from your conversion kit. Ensure it is snug but do not overtighten. Overtightening can damage the threads. The LP orifice has a smaller opening. This restricts gas flow for the higher pressure of LP gas.

This change is essential for your dryer to burn LP gas correctly. It is a precise adjustment.

### Adjusting the Pressure Regulator

The pressure regulator manages the gas pressure delivered to the burner. It must be set for LP gas.

1.  **Locate Regulator:** The pressure regulator is usually a brass or aluminum block located on the gas valve assembly. It often has a cap or screw on it.
2.  **Convert Regulator:** Many Electrolux regulators are convertible. You simply remove a cap or screw, flip a small plastic or metal piece inside, and reinsert it. One side is marked "NAT" (natural gas) and the other "LP." Make sure the "LP" side faces out. Some regulators require installing a new spring. Follow your specific Electrolux conversion kit instructions exactly.
3.  **Tighten Cap/Screw:** Once adjusted, replace the cap or screw firmly.

This adjustment ensures the correct gas pressure for LP. Without this step, the dryer will not function safely or efficiently with propane.

### Reassembly and Leak Testing

After replacing parts, you must reassemble the dryer and check for leaks.

1.  **Reassemble Dryer:** Put all dryer panels back in place. Secure all screws. Make sure no wires are pinched.
2.  **Reconnect Gas Line:** Reconnect the flexible gas line to the dryer's gas inlet pipe. Use an adjustable wrench to tighten the connection firmly. Do not overtighten, as this can strip threads.
3.  **Open Gas Supply:** Slowly turn the main gas shut-off valve back to the "on" position.
4.  **Perform Leak Test:** Mix dish soap and water in a spray bottle. Spray the mixture liberally over all gas connections you touched. Look for bubbles forming. Bubbles indicate a gas leak. If you see bubbles, tighten the connection slightly and retest. If bubbles persist, turn off the gas and seek professional help. This step is critical for safety. You can also apply this same principle when you [can you convert electric oven to gas](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-convert-electric-oven-to-gas) and similar gas appliance conversions.
5.  **Restore Power:** Plug the dryer back into the electrical outlet.

Never skip the leak test. It confirms your connections are sealed.

## Post-Conversion Checks and Safe Operation

After converting your Electrolux dryer to LP, some final checks are necessary. These steps confirm proper operation and continued safety. It is important to ensure everything works as expected before regular use.

### Verifying Proper Flame

The color of the flame inside your dryer's burner indicates if it is burning gas correctly.

1.  **Start Dryer:** Run your dryer on a heat setting for a few minutes.
2.  **Observe Flame:** Look for the flame through any observation ports, or carefully remove a panel if necessary (with the dryer running for observation, but be extremely cautious). A proper LP flame should be mostly blue. It might have a small amount of yellow at the tips.
3.  **Incorrect Flame:** A large, flickering yellow or orange flame indicates a problem. This might mean the orifice is incorrect, the regulator is not properly adjusted, or there is insufficient airflow.
4.  **Adjust Air Shutter (If Applicable):** Some older Electrolux dryer models have an adjustable air shutter on the burner tube. If your flame is too yellow, you can slightly open the air shutter. This increases the air-to-gas mixture. If the flame lifts off the burner, close the shutter slightly. Newer models often have fixed air shutters.

A correctly burning flame ensures efficient drying and prevents soot buildup. If you notice any issues, turn off the dryer and gas immediately. This is similar to how you would check performance if you were to [how to convert gas dryer to electric dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-convert-gas-dryer-to-electric-dryer) or modify other appliances.

### Routine Maintenance for LP Dryers

LP dryers require ongoing maintenance just like natural gas dryers. Proper care helps prolong your dryer's life and keeps it running safely.

*   **Clean Lint Filter:** Clean the lint filter after every load. This improves drying efficiency and reduces fire risk.
*   **Inspect Venting System:** Periodically check your dryer's exhaust vent for lint buildup. A clogged vent restricts airflow and can cause the dryer to overheat.
*   **Check Gas Connections:** Annually, perform a quick visual inspection of gas connections. Use the soap solution if you suspect any issues.
*   **Professional Servicing:** Consider a professional inspection every few years. They can check gas pressure, burner operation, and overall dryer health. This helps identify potential problems early.

Following these maintenance tips ensures your newly converted LP Electrolux dryer serves you well for years. It also maintains a safe home environment.
