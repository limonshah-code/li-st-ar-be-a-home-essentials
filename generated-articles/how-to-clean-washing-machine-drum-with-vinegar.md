## How To Clean Washing Machine Drum With Vinegar

Has your washing machine started to smell less than fresh? Is your laundry coming out with an unpleasant odor? I know this feeling well. Over time, residue from detergents, fabric softeners, and hard water minerals builds up inside your washing machine drum. This creates a breeding ground for mold, mildew, and bacteria, leading to foul smells and less effective cleaning.

Fortunately, you do not need harsh chemicals to fix this problem. Vinegar, a natural and powerful cleaner, offers an excellent solution. It deodorizes, disinfects, and dissolves mineral deposits effectively. This article will guide you through a simple, step-by-step process to [clean your washing machine drum with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-vinegar). You will learn how to restore your machine's freshness and keep your clothes smelling great.

### Takeaway

A clean washing machine drum ensures fresh, odor-free laundry. Here's what you need to know:

*   Vinegar is an effective, natural cleaner for dissolving residue and killing bacteria.
*   Regular cleaning prevents mold and mildew buildup.
*   Both front-load and top-load machines benefit from vinegar cleaning.
*   A combination of vinegar and baking soda tackles tough odors and grime.
*   Routine maintenance keeps your machine running efficiently and extends its lifespan.

To effectively clean your washing machine drum with vinegar, run an empty hot water cycle using two cups of distilled white vinegar. Follow this with a second empty hot water cycle with half a cup of baking soda. This process removes soap scum, mildew, and odors, leaving your drum fresh and clean.

### Understanding Why Your Washing Machine Drum Needs Cleaning

My washing machine is a workhorse, handling countless loads of laundry. However, many people forget that the machine itself needs cleaning too. Think about it: dirt, grime, detergent residue, and hard water minerals constantly pass through the drum. Over time, these elements accumulate, creating an unpleasant environment inside your machine.

This buildup leads to several problems. Your clothes may not come out as clean as they should. They might even develop a musty smell after washing. More seriously, mold and mildew can thrive in the damp, dark conditions of the drum, posing health risks and shortening your machine's life.

#### Common Causes of Odor and Grime

Several factors contribute to a dirty and smelly washing machine drum. Excess detergent use is a major culprit. Modern high-efficiency (HE) machines require less soap than older models, and using too much creates a thick, sticky film. This film traps dirt and provides a food source for bacteria.

Fabric softener also contributes to this residue. It leaves a waxy coating inside the drum and dispenser, which can trap lint and grime. Hard water, common in many areas, leaves mineral deposits like limescale. These deposits are stubborn and create rough surfaces where dirt and mold can cling. Skipping regular cleaning cycles also allows these issues to worsen. Understanding these causes helps us appreciate the need for effective cleaning methods, such as learning [how to clean a washing machine drum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-a-washing-machine-drum) thoroughly.

#### Benefits of a Clean Drum

A clean washing machine drum offers significant benefits for your laundry and your machine. First, your clothes will emerge truly clean and fresh. The absence of residue means detergent can work more effectively, reaching fabric fibers without interference. This eliminates those musty odors that can transfer to your clean garments.

Second, a clean drum extends the lifespan of your appliance. Buildup can strain the machine's components, leading to reduced efficiency and potential breakdowns. Regular cleaning prevents corrosion and blockage of hoses and filters. Finally, a mold-free machine is healthier for your home. Mold spores can trigger allergies and respiratory issues. Keeping your drum pristine ensures a hygienic washing environment for your family's clothes. This simple maintenance step is vital for overall home health.

### Gather Your Tools: What You Need for a Vinegar Clean

Before you start cleaning, it is important to gather all your supplies. I like to have everything ready to go. This makes the cleaning process smooth and efficient. You probably already own most of these items, as they are common household staples.

Preparing your tools beforehand saves time and prevents interruptions. This small step ensures you can complete the entire cleaning process without searching for missing items. Having the right supplies makes the task much simpler.

#### Essential Supplies List

Here is what you will need for a thorough [washing machine drum cleaning](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-drum) using vinegar:

*   **Distilled White Vinegar:** This is the star of our cleaning process. You will need about 2-4 cups, depending on your machine type and level of grime. Distilled white vinegar is preferred because it has a consistent acidity and leaves no residue or color.
*   **Baking Soda:** About half a cup. Baking soda is a natural deodorizer and a gentle abrasive. It works great with vinegar to tackle stubborn buildup.
*   **Microfiber Cloths or Sponges:** You will need a few clean cloths or sponges for wiping down surfaces. These are effective at trapping dirt and grime.
*   **Spray Bottle (Optional):** This is useful for applying a vinegar solution to specific areas, like gaskets or detergent dispensers.
*   **Old Toothbrush or Small Brush (Optional):** Great for scrubbing tight crevices and hard-to-reach spots.
*   **Warm Water:** You will need this for rinsing and wiping.

Gathering these items ensures you are fully prepared for a successful cleaning session.

#### Choosing the Right Vinegar

When it comes to cleaning your washing machine drum, distilled white vinegar is your best choice. Do not confuse it with other types of vinegar like apple cider vinegar or balsamic vinegar. These varieties contain sugars or colorings that can leave residues or even stain your machine. Distilled white vinegar, with its clear appearance and consistent acidity (usually 5% acetic acid), is perfect.

The acetic acid in white vinegar is a mild acid. It effectively breaks down soap scum, hard water deposits, and mildew. It also acts as a natural disinfectant, killing bacteria and mold spores responsible for unpleasant odors. Always ensure you are using a fresh bottle of distilled white vinegar for optimal cleaning power. This simple choice makes a big difference in the effectiveness of your cleaning efforts.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Cleaning Your Front-Load Washing Machine Drum with Vinegar

Front-load washing machines are popular for their efficiency, but their design can make them prone to mold and mildew, especially around the rubber gasket. Cleaning the drum of a front-loader requires a specific approach to ensure all areas are addressed. I make sure to tackle the gasket first, as that is often where the worst buildup occurs. This comprehensive method will leave your machine sparkling clean and odor-free.

Always check your washing machine's manual before starting any cleaning process. Some manufacturers might have specific recommendations or warnings for using certain cleaning agents. This ensures you do not accidentally void your warranty or damage your appliance. Most modern front-loaders are perfectly safe for vinegar cleaning.

#### Initial Preparation

Before you begin the cleaning cycle, prepare your machine. First, remove all clothes from the drum. An empty machine is crucial for a thorough cleaning. Next, inspect the detergent dispenser. Many dispensers become caked with old detergent and fabric softener. Pull out any removable parts of the dispenser drawer and clean them separately. Soak these parts in hot soapy water or a vinegar solution, then scrub away any residue with a brush or old toothbrush. Rinse them thoroughly and set aside to dry.

Finally, pay close attention to the rubber gasket around the door. This area is a notorious spot for mold and mildew growth due to trapped moisture. Use a spray bottle filled with equal parts white vinegar and water. Spray the gasket generously, making sure to get into all the folds. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, wipe away the grime, mold, and mildew with a clean microfiber cloth. You might need to use an old toothbrush for stubborn spots. This initial prep targets the areas where most visible dirt hides, setting the stage for a deeper clean. [Getting rid of mold in the washing machine drum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-rid-of-mold-in-washing-machine-drum) is a key part of this step.

#### The Vinegar Wash Cycle

Now, let's run the main cleaning cycle with vinegar. Close the dispenser drawer after cleaning it. Pour two cups of distilled white vinegar directly into the detergent dispenser or directly into the drum itself. I find pouring it directly into the drum works best for an immediate impact. Then, select the hottest water setting on your washing machine. You should also choose the largest load size setting, if applicable, to ensure maximum water fills the tub.

Run a complete wash cycle. The hot water helps vinegar dissolve soap scum, mineral deposits, and mold spores effectively. The vinegar will circulate throughout the machine, sanitizing the drum, hoses, and pump. Many newer machines also have a "Drum Clean" or "Sanitize" cycle. If your LG washing machine has this feature, you can learn [how to clean an LG washing machine with vinegar](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-lg-washing-machine-with-vinegar) by simply adding vinegar and selecting that option. This specialized cycle is designed for deep cleaning and works very well with vinegar.

#### Manual Cleaning of Components

After the vinegar wash cycle finishes, open the machine door. You will likely see some dissolved grime inside the drum. Take a clean cloth dampened with a 50/50 vinegar-water solution and wipe down the interior of the drum. This removes any loosened residue. Do not forget the inside of the door and the exterior of the gasket. Ensure no vinegar solution remains on the gasket, as prolonged exposure can sometimes affect rubber.

Next, it is time for the baking soda rinse. Add half a cup of baking soda to the detergent dispenser. Run another full wash cycle on the hottest water setting. This baking soda cycle neutralizes any remaining vinegar odor and acts as a gentle abrasive to scrub away any lingering film. Baking soda also boosts the cleaning power, leaving the drum extra fresh. Once this cycle is complete, wipe down the drum one last time with a dry cloth. Leave the door ajar to allow the drum to air dry completely, preventing new mold growth. This simple method helps you keep your drum clean and fresh, much like maintaining [how to clean your washing machine drum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-washing-machine-drum) regularly.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Cleaning Your Top-Load Washing Machine Drum with Vinegar

Cleaning a top-load washing machine drum with vinegar follows a slightly different process compared to front-loaders. Top-loaders typically have a deeper tub and often lack a rubber gasket at the door, which is good. However, they can still accumulate plenty of residue and develop musty smells. I find this method very straightforward for my top-loader, and it yields excellent results.

The key difference with top-loaders is the ability to easily fill the tub and soak the interior components. This soaking action allows the vinegar to work its magic more effectively on tough buildup. Just like with front-loaders, make sure the machine is completely empty before you start.

#### Filling the Tub with Vinegar Solution

First, ensure your top-load washing machine drum is empty. Then, pour about 4 cups of distilled white vinegar directly into the drum. You can adjust this amount slightly based on the size of your machine; larger machines might benefit from an extra cup. Set your machine to its hottest water temperature setting and its largest load size. Start the wash cycle.

Allow the machine to fill completely with hot water and vinegar. Once the tub is full and the agitation has just begun, pause or stop the cycle. Most top-loaders allow you to lift the lid to pause the cycle. This creates a powerful vinegar soaking solution that will sit and dissolve grime. If your machine locks, consult your manual on how to pause or unlock it safely during a cycle.

#### Soaking and Scrubbing

After filling the tub and pausing the cycle, let the hot vinegar solution soak for at least one hour. For heavily soiled or smelly machines, I sometimes let it soak for up to two or even three hours. This soaking time is crucial. It gives the acetic acid in the vinegar ample time to break down soap scum, mineral deposits, and mold that cling to the drum walls and agitator.

During the soak time, use a clean cloth or sponge dampened with some of the vinegar solution from the tub. You can also use a 50/50 vinegar-water mixture in a spray bottle. Manually scrub the top edge of the drum, the fabric softener dispenser, and any other accessible parts that might have residue. Use an old toothbrush to get into tight spots or under the rim of the agitator. You will be surprised at how much gunk comes off. This step is particularly effective for getting rid of [mold in the washing machine drum](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-rid-of-mold-in-washing-machine-drum) that might be visible.

#### Rinse Cycle and Final Wipedown

Once the soaking time is complete, close the lid and allow the machine to finish the full wash cycle. The powerful agitation and drainage will flush away all the loosened grime and vinegar solution. After this cycle finishes, you are ready for the baking soda step. Add half a cup of baking soda directly into the empty drum.

Run another complete wash cycle on the hottest water setting. This baking soda rinse helps to neutralize any lingering vinegar smell and works as a gentle abrasive to scrub away remaining film. After this second cycle, wipe down the entire interior of the drum with a clean, dry cloth. Leave the lid open for several hours, or even overnight, to ensure the drum dries completely. This prevents any immediate return of moisture-related odors. Your top-load washing machine drum will now be remarkably fresh and clean.

### Tackling Stubborn Issues: Mold, Mildew, and Lingering Odors

Sometimes, a basic vinegar wash is not enough to eliminate persistent problems. If your washing machine drum has visible mold, stubborn mildew stains, or a strong, lingering musty odor, you need to take extra steps. I have faced this problem many times, and a targeted approach makes all the difference. Combining vinegar with other natural agents can boost cleaning power.

Mold and mildew thrive in damp environments like washing machines. Lingering odors often point to unseen bacterial growth. Addressing these issues directly ensures a truly clean machine and fresh laundry. Do not let these problems become permanent fixtures in your home.

#### Targeted Mold Removal Techniques

Mold and mildew are common issues, especially in front-load washers. Their rubber gasket is a prime spot. If you see black or green mold, directly spray a solution of undiluted white vinegar onto the affected areas. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. The acetic acid in vinegar is a natural fungicide and will kill most mold and mildew spores.

After soaking, scrub the mold vigorously with an old toothbrush or a small scrub brush. Pay close attention to all the folds and crevices of the gasket. For deep-seated mold, you might need to repeat this process. After scrubbing, run an empty hot water cycle with two cups of vinegar, as described earlier. This ensures that any loosened mold spores are flushed away from the entire system.

#### Addressing Persistent Smells

A persistent musty smell often indicates hidden mold or bacterial growth within the machine's components, like the pump or hoses. Beyond the vinegar and baking soda cycles, there are additional steps to take. First, ensure you are not leaving wet clothes in the machine for too long after a cycle. This creates a perfect environment for odors to develop.

Consider adding a half cup of baking soda directly into the drum *before* adding clothes for a regular wash cycle occasionally. This acts as a natural deodorizer for your laundry and helps absorb odors from the drum during the wash. You can also mix half a cup of vinegar with your fabric softener in the dispenser; it works as a natural softener and odor remover without residue. For specific brand instructions, learning [can you use vinegar in a Bosch washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-use-vinegar-in-bosch-washing-machine) might offer valuable insights for your model.

#### The Role of Baking Soda

Baking soda is an excellent companion to vinegar in tackling stubborn washing machine issues. While vinegar breaks down mineral deposits and kills bacteria, baking soda excels at absorbing odors and providing a gentle abrasive action. I always use them together for a super clean result. It's like a tag team of natural cleaning power.

When you use baking soda after the vinegar cycle, it neutralizes any remaining vinegar smell. It also helps to lift and scrub away any lingering residue that the vinegar might have loosened. You can even make a paste of baking soda and a little water to directly scrub very stubborn stains or mold spots inside the drum or dispenser. This dynamic duo ensures a thoroughly clean and fresh-smelling washing machine drum, leaving no trace of grime or foul odors.

### Maintaining a Spotless Drum: Regular Cleaning Habits

Once you have thoroughly cleaned your washing machine drum with vinegar, the goal is to keep it that way. Regular maintenance is far easier than deep cleaning a neglected machine. I have found that incorporating a few simple habits into my routine prevents those nasty odors and buildup from returning. A little effort goes a long way in ensuring your machine stays fresh.

These practices not only keep your drum clean but also contribute to the overall efficiency and longevity of your appliance. A well-maintained washing machine works better and lasts longer. It also means your clothes consistently come out clean and fresh.

#### Frequency of Cleaning

How often should you clean your washing machine drum with vinegar? The answer depends on your usage and water type. For average household use (3-5 loads per week), I recommend a full vinegar and baking soda clean every 1-3 months. If you wash clothes more frequently, have hard water, or notice odors developing sooner, increase the frequency to monthly.

For machines with a "Drum Clean" or "Sanitize" cycle, use it with vinegar or a commercial cleaner as recommended by the manufacturer. Even if you use these cycles, a manual wipe-down of the gasket and dispenser should happen weekly. Consistency is key here. Regular, less intensive cleaning prevents the need for more drastic measures later on.

#### Post-Wash Practices

Simple habits after each wash cycle can significantly reduce grime and odor buildup. Always remove wet laundry immediately after the cycle finishes. Leaving damp clothes in the machine creates a perfect environment for mold and mildew. After emptying the machine, leave the washing machine door (for front-loaders) or lid (for top-loaders) ajar. This allows air to circulate, helping the drum and gasket dry out completely. This single step is one of the most effective ways to prevent musty smells.

For front-loaders, make a habit of quickly wiping down the rubber gasket with a dry cloth after each wash. This removes trapped water and lint. Also, periodically clean out the detergent and fabric softener dispensers, as these are common spots for residue accumulation. These small actions take only moments but make a huge difference in maintaining a fresh washing machine drum.

#### Using the "Drum Clean" Cycle (if applicable)

Many modern washing machines come equipped with a "Drum Clean," "Tub Clean," or "Sanitize" cycle. These cycles are specifically designed to clean the interior of the machine. They often use hotter water and longer agitation times to flush out residue. If your machine has this feature, you should use it regularly.

When using a "Drum Clean" cycle, you can often still incorporate vinegar. For example, for a Bosch washing machine, you might wonder [how to drum clean a Bosch washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drum-clean-bosch-washing-machine). Typically, you would add two cups of distilled white vinegar directly to the drum, close the door, and then select the "Drum Clean" cycle. Some manufacturers suggest running this cycle monthly or after a certain number of wash cycles. Consult your appliance manual for specific instructions for your model, such as [how to put a Beko washing machine on drum clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-beko-washing-machine-on-drum-clean), as procedures can vary by brand. This specialized cycle, combined with vinegar, provides a powerful cleaning boost.

### Vinegar Versus Other Cleaners: Why Choose Natural

When considering how to clean your washing machine drum, you have many options, including harsh chemical cleaners. However, I always lean towards natural solutions like vinegar. There are compelling reasons to choose vinegar over commercial products,
