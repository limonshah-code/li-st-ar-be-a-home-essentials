## Troubleshooting Common Ruler Cleaning Challenges

Even with the best care, cleaning challenges can arise. Sometimes, marks seem permanent. Other times, the ruler itself feels compromised. This section addresses common problems. You will find solutions to restore your Ruler 10 22. These tips help overcome tricky cleaning situations.

One common issue is faded markings after cleaning. This usually happens if you use harsh chemicals. It can also happen with vigorous scrubbing. If markings fade, stop cleaning that way. Future cleaning must be gentler. For plastic rulers, some fading is irreversible. For metal rulers, re-etching services exist. Prevention is the best cure here.

Stains that penetrate the material are tough. This is common with wooden rulers and ink. If the stain is deep, it might be permanent. For wood, light sanding can help. Use fine-grit sandpaper. Sand only the stained area. Be careful not to remove markings. Then, re-seal the wood. This can minimize the stain's appearance.

Scratches can also make a ruler look dirty. Dirt gets trapped in scratches. For plastic, fine polishing compounds can reduce shallow scratches. Apply with a soft cloth. This makes the surface smoother. For metal, deep scratches are harder to fix. Prevention is key. Keep your ruler safe from abrasive surfaces.
