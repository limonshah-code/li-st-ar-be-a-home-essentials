## How to Machine Wash Toms for a Fresh, Clean Look

Toms shoes are beloved for their comfort and style. They become dirty with regular wear. Many people wonder about the best way to clean them, especially when they need a deep refresh. A machine wash can be an effective method if done correctly.

This comprehensive guide will show you **how to machine wash Toms** safely and efficiently. We will cover every step, from preparing your shoes to selecting the right washing machine settings. You will learn about appropriate detergents, drying methods, and how to maintain their clean appearance. Follow these instructions to keep your Toms looking great and lasting longer. Get ready to give your favorite pair a new lease on life.

### Takeaway

*   **Prepare shoes:** Remove loose dirt, spot treat stains, and use a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Use cold water:** Select a cold water setting to prevent shrinking or color fade.
*   **Gentle cycle:** Choose a delicate or gentle wash cycle.
*   **Mild detergent:** Use a small amount of mild, liquid detergent.
*   **Air dry only:** Never put Toms in a dryer; air dry completely.

You can machine wash Toms. Use a cold, delicate cycle with mild detergent. Always place them in a mesh laundry bag. Remove insoles first. Air dry Toms completely, away from direct heat or sunlight, to maintain their shape and material integrity.

### Prepping Your Toms for a Washing Machine Cycle

Getting your Toms ready for the wash is important. Proper preparation prevents damage and ensures a thorough clean. Skipping this step can lead to less effective results or harm to your shoes. I always take a few minutes for this part; it makes a big difference.

First, identify the material of your Toms. Most Toms are canvas. Some have suede or leather details. This guide focuses on canvas Toms. Suede or leather details require different cleaning methods.

#### Gathering Your Essentials

You need a few items before you begin. These tools make the washing process smoother. Collect everything you need in one place. This saves time during the cleaning process.

*   **Soft brush or old toothbrush:** For scrubbing loose dirt.
*   **Mild liquid detergent:** Choose one free of harsh chemicals.
*   **Mesh laundry bag:** This protects your shoes in the machine.
*   **Stain remover (optional):** For stubborn spots.
*   **Old towels or paper towels:** For stuffing shoes during drying.

#### Removing Loose Debris

Begin by removing any large debris. Take your Toms outside or over a trash can. Clap the shoes together to dislodge loose dirt and dust. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub away mud and grime. Pay attention to the soles and seams. This prevents dirt from spreading in the washing machine. Getting rid of surface dirt now helps the machine wash focus on deeper grime. It's a simple step that really improves the outcome.

#### Spot Treating Stains

Before placing your Toms in the washing machine, treat any visible stains. This is a crucial step for achieving really clean shoes. Pre-treating helps lift stubborn marks that a regular wash might not remove. For many stains, a mixture of mild detergent and water works well. Apply it directly to the stain.

Gently rub the stained area with a soft brush or cloth. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. This gives the solution time to work. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach, as these can discolor or damage the fabric.

This method targets specific problem areas.

### Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings for Toms

The correct washing machine settings are critical for successful Toms cleaning. Incorrect settings can shrink the fabric or cause colors to fade. My goal is always to protect the shoes while getting them clean. Using the right settings ensures your Toms stay in good condition for longer. This step is about gentle care.

When you **machine wash Toms**, the goal is to mimic a gentle hand wash. Avoid harsh actions that could distort their shape or material. Think of it as a delicate spa treatment for your shoes. Your washing machine has features designed for this purpose.

#### Understanding Water Temperature

Always use cold water when washing Toms. Hot water can cause the canvas fabric to shrink. It can also make colors bleed or fade. Cold water is much gentler on the materials. It still cleans effectively when combined with the right detergent. I always choose cold water for any delicate items. This prevents unwanted surprises after the wash.

Cold water helps preserve the integrity of the adhesive that holds the shoe together. High temperatures can weaken these bonds. Stick to cold water for the best results.

#### Selecting the Gentle Cycle

The delicate or gentle cycle is your best friend here. This cycle uses slower agitation and spin speeds. It reduces stress on the shoe fabric and stitching. A regular or heavy-duty cycle is too harsh for Toms. Such cycles can pull seams apart or damage the shape of the shoe. I make sure to select this setting every time I wash shoes.

A gentle cycle minimizes tumbling. It prevents the shoes from banging against the drum. This protects both your Toms and your washing machine.

#### Using Laundry Bags

Placing your Toms in a mesh laundry bag is important. This bag acts as a protective barrier. It prevents the shoes from getting tangled with other items. It also cushions them against the washing machine drum. Without a bag, shoes can be tossed around too aggressively. This can cause them to lose their shape or get damaged.

The mesh material allows water and detergent to flow through easily. Your shoes still get clean. I often put one shoe per bag, or two in a larger bag. This extra step provides a layer of security. It gives me peace of mind knowing my Toms are protected during the wash. You can also explore specific insights on [how to wash Toms in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-toms-in-the-washing-machine) for more detailed advice.

### Detergent Selection and Loading Your Toms

Choosing the right detergent and loading your shoes correctly are vital steps. The wrong detergent can be too harsh, stripping colors or damaging materials. Improper loading can lead to uneven cleaning or even machine damage. My aim is always to use products that are effective yet gentle. This ensures my Toms come out clean and intact.

Think of this as the point where the actual cleaning agents meet your shoes. You want a product that works but does not cause harm. Loading them properly means they move freely enough to get clean, but not so much they get damaged.

#### Picking the Perfect Detergent

Select a mild, liquid laundry detergent. Avoid powdered detergents, as they can leave residue on the fabric. Look for detergents that are free of harsh chemicals, bleach, or optical brighteners. These can be too aggressive for the canvas material and cause fading. A small amount is all you need. Using too much detergent creates excessive suds. This can be difficult to rinse out. It can also leave a sticky film on your shoes.

I usually opt for a sensitive skin formula. These are typically milder. A quarter to a half cap of liquid detergent is often enough for a small load including shoes. Remember, less is often more when it comes to washing delicate items like Toms.

#### Protecting Your Washing Machine

Before loading your Toms, consider protecting your washing machine. Shoes can be heavy and might cause noise or imbalance. To reduce this, you can wash your Toms with a few old towels. The towels add bulk to the load. They absorb some of the impact as the shoes tumble. This helps balance the machine. It also reduces the loud thumping sounds.

Washing with towels can also prevent the shoes from hitting the drum directly. This is good for both the shoes and the machine. Some people even put a couple of old tennis balls in the machine. This provides additional cushioning and agitation. However, for Toms, the mesh bag and towels are usually sufficient.

#### Properly Loading Shoes

Place your Toms, already secured in their mesh laundry bag, into the washing machine. If you are using towels, distribute them evenly around the shoes. This helps maintain balance during the spin cycle. Avoid overloading the machine. Overloading prevents items from moving freely. This results in poor cleaning.

Make sure the shoes are not crammed in. They need space to agitate gently. You can find more information about placing shoes in a washing machine and [can I put Toms in the washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-put-toms-in-the-washing-machine) for further guidance. Proper loading ensures the water and detergent reach all parts of the shoe. This leads to a more uniform and effective clean.

### The Machine Washing Process: What to Expect

Once your Toms are prepped and loaded, it is time to start the washing machine. This part is mostly hands-off. However, knowing what happens and what to listen for is helpful. The machine does the work, but your prior choices guide its performance. I always listen for any unusual sounds. This lets me know if something is wrong.

The entire process should be gentle and relatively quiet. If you hear excessive banging, pause the machine. Check the load distribution. Adjust it if needed. This step is about observing and ensuring the smooth operation of your selected settings.

#### Starting the Wash

With the shoes in their mesh bag, detergent added, and the delicate/gentle cycle selected, you can start the machine. Confirm the water temperature is set to cold. Close the lid or door. Press the start button. The machine will begin to fill with water. Then, it will start its gentle agitation cycle.

The wash cycle for shoes is typically shorter than for regular clothes. It might last 20-30 minutes, depending on your machine. This shorter duration is part of the gentle care approach. It reduces the time your Toms spend being agitated in water. This further minimizes potential damage.

#### Mid-Cycle Checks

During the wash cycle, you may want to do a quick check. If your machine allows, you can pause it and look inside. This lets you confirm that the shoes are moving freely and not getting tangled. You can also listen for excessive noise. Loud thumping indicates an unbalanced load. If this happens, rearrange the towels or shoes. Ensure they are distributed more evenly.

This is also a chance to check if the detergent is rinsing properly. If you see too many suds, it might mean too much detergent was used. You can add an extra rinse cycle later if needed. These quick checks prevent issues before they become problems.

#### Post-Wash Inspection

Once the cycle finishes, immediately remove your Toms from the washing machine. Do not leave them sitting in the wet drum. Leaving them wet can lead to mildew and an unpleasant odor. Take them out of their mesh bag. Inspect them for cleanliness. Most light to moderate dirt should be gone. Stubborn stains might still be visible.

If a stain persists, you might need to spot treat it again or consider a hand wash for that area. Check for any signs of damage. Look for loose threads or detached soles. If everything looks good, you are ready for the crucial drying stage. This quick inspection helps you gauge the effectiveness of the wash. It guides future cleaning efforts.

### Drying Your Toms After Machine Washing Safely

Drying your Toms properly after machine washing is just as important as the wash itself. Incorrect drying methods can cause shrinking, warping, or damage to the shoe's structure. My golden rule here is: no dryers for Toms. The heat is their enemy. Air drying is the only way to go.

This stage preserves the shape and size of your shoes. It also prevents the growth of mold or mildew. Be patient during this step. Rushing the drying process can undo all your careful washing efforts.

#### The Importance of Air Drying

Always air dry your Toms. Machine dryers use high heat, which can cause significant damage. Canvas shoes are particularly susceptible to shrinking and material degradation from heat. The rubber soles and adhesive bonds can also weaken or melt. This leads to shoes losing their shape and falling apart.

Find a spot with good air circulation. This could be outdoors in the shade or indoors near an open window. Avoid direct sunlight. Intense sun can bleach the fabric colors and also cause excessive drying, leading to cracking. A steady, gentle air flow is ideal. This natural drying method maintains the integrity of the shoe materials.

#### Reshaping and Stuffing

As soon as you remove your Toms from the washing machine, reshape them. Wet fabric can lose its form. Gently push and mold the shoes back into their original shape. To help maintain this shape during drying, stuff the shoes. Use clean, dry paper towels or old towels. Crumple them loosely and place them inside the shoes.

The paper towels absorb excess moisture from the inside. They also help the shoes keep their natural form. Change the paper towels every few hours if they become too damp. This speeds up the drying process. It also prevents any musty smells. This small step makes a big difference in how your Toms look when dry.

#### Finding the Right Drying Spot

Choose a drying location that is warm, dry, and has good air movement. As mentioned, direct sunlight is not good. A shaded area outdoors on a warm day works well. Indoors, place them near a fan or in a well-ventilated room. Avoid humid areas like bathrooms or basements. These environments can prolong drying time and encourage mildew growth.

Drying can take 24-48 hours, sometimes longer, depending on humidity and airflow. Make sure they are completely dry before you wear them or store them. Wearing damp shoes can lead to foot odor and material breakdown. Patience during drying ensures your Toms are perfectly ready to wear. Sometimes, if you need to clean shoes quickly without a machine, you might look into [how to wash shoes without washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-shoes-without-washing-machine) options. This can give perspective on different cleaning needs.

### Maintaining Cleanliness and Extending Toms Lifespan

Washing your Toms is a great way to refresh them, but consistent care prevents them from getting excessively dirty in the first place. Regular maintenance helps extend their lifespan. It keeps them looking good between washes. I find that a little effort daily saves a lot of work later.

This section focuses on simple habits. These habits make your clean Toms last longer. They also reduce how often you need a full machine wash.

#### Daily Care Habits

Adopt a few simple habits to keep your Toms cleaner. After each wear, give them a quick brush-off. Use a soft brush or cloth to remove surface dust and dirt. This prevents grime from setting into the fabric. If you notice any small scuffs or marks, wipe them away immediately. A damp cloth can often handle fresh spots.

Try not to wear your Toms in very muddy or wet conditions. If they do get wet, let them air dry completely before storing. Proper storage also helps; keep them in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight. These small actions reduce dirt buildup.

#### Addressing New Stains Quickly

Speed is key when dealing with new stains. The sooner you address a stain, the easier it is to remove. If something spills on your Toms, blot it immediately with a clean cloth. Do not rub, as rubbing can spread the stain. For most fresh stains on canvas, a mixture of mild soap and water can work wonders.

Dab the solution onto the stain with a clean cloth. Gently blot until the stain lifts. Rinse the area with a damp cloth to remove any soap residue. This quick action often prevents a small stain from becoming a stubborn problem. For a deeper understanding of spot cleaning, you can refer to [how to clean Toms shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-toms-shoes).

#### When to Hand Wash Instead

Sometimes, a full machine wash is not necessary or appropriate. For very delicate Toms or shoes with significant embellishments, hand washing might be better. If your Toms only have a small spot or need a quick freshening, a spot clean or a gentle hand wash is less harsh.

Hand washing allows for more control over the cleaning process. You can focus on specific areas. You can also be gentler with the fabric. If you are unsure about machine washing a particular pair, or if they have special materials, a hand wash is a safer alternative. This preserves the shoe's unique features. It also protects more delicate components from machine agitation.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Washing Toms

Machine washing Toms can be a great way to clean them, but mistakes can lead to damaged shoes. Knowing what to avoid is just as important as knowing what to do. I have learned from my own errors, and I want to help you prevent yours. This section highlights common pitfalls that can ruin your favorite pair.

Steering clear of these mistakes helps ensure your Toms come out clean and in good shape. It protects your investment and keeps your shoes wearable for longer.

#### Over-Washing Your Toms

Washing your Toms too often can wear them out prematurely. Each wash cycle, even a gentle one, puts stress on the fabric and stitching. Frequent washing can cause the canvas to thin, fade, or lose its shape faster. Only machine wash your Toms when they are significantly dirty.

For light dirt or simple freshening, try spot cleaning or airing them out. Think about the need before you toss them in the machine. Less frequent machine washing extends the life of your shoes. It saves water and energy too. Be mindful of how often you expose them to the washing machine environment.

#### Using Hot Water or Harsh Chemicals

Never use hot water to wash Toms. Hot water is a common culprit for shrinking canvas shoes and causing colors to bleed. It can also weaken the adhesives that hold the shoe together. Always stick to cold water for a gentle wash. Similarly, avoid harsh chemicals like bleach or strong stain removers. These can permanently damage the fabric, causing discoloration or weakening the material fibers.

Opt for mild, liquid detergents designed for delicate items. If you need a stain remover, choose an oxygen-based one or a natural solution. Test it on an inconspicuous area first. This protects both the fabric color and strength. This is a critical point when you [can I machine wash Toms](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-machine-wash-toms) successfully.

#### Ignoring Pre-Treatment Steps

Skipping pre-treatment steps is another common error. Simply throwing dirty Toms into the washing machine without removing loose dirt or spot-treating stains reduces the effectiveness of the wash. Loose dirt can become embedded deeper into the fabric. Stains that are not pre-treated might remain after the cycle.

Taking a few minutes to brush off debris and address any visible stains significantly improves the final result. It allows the washing machine to focus on overall cleaning. This ensures a more thorough and satisfactory outcome. Proper preparation is the foundation of a good wash. It makes a big difference in how clean your shoes become.
