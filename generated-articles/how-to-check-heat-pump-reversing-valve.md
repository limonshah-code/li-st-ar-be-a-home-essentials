## How To Check Your Heat Pump Reversing Valve

Has your heat pump stopped heating or cooling? You might suspect the reversing valve. This component directs refrigerant flow, switching your system between heating and cooling modes. A faulty reversing valve causes big problems. Learning **how to check heat pump reversing valve** operation helps you diagnose system issues. I will show you how to identify problems and perform simple tests. This guide provides clear steps to pinpoint if your reversing valve is failing. Understanding these checks saves you time and potential repair costs.

### Takeaway

*   Listen for distinct clicks from the reversing valve solenoid when changing modes.
*   Feel the refrigerant lines at the valve for temperature changes.
*   Check the solenoid coil's electrical resistance with a multimeter.
*   Observe heat pump operation in both heating and cooling modes.
*   Always disconnect power before touching any components.

### Understanding Your Heat Pump Reversing Valve

Checking a heat pump reversing valve involves listening, feeling, and electrical testing. First, cycle your heat pump between heating and cooling to listen for a clear click from the valve's solenoid. Next, carefully feel the refrigerant lines connected to the valve; a working valve should show distinct temperature differences. Finally, use a multimeter to measure the solenoid coil's resistance for proper electrical function. Always ensure power is off before any hands-on checks.

### What Is a Heat Pump Reversing Valve?

A heat pump reversing valve is a crucial component in your system. It controls the direction of refrigerant flow. This allows your heat pump to provide both heating and cooling. In winter, the valve directs hot refrigerant indoors for warmth. In summer, it sends hot refrigerant outdoors for cooling. This valve enables the heat pump's dual functionality. Understanding [how does heat pump reversing valve work](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-does-heat-pump-reversing-valve-work) is key to troubleshooting.

The valve uses a solenoid to move a slide, which changes the refrigerant path. When the thermostat calls for a different mode, the solenoid receives an electrical signal. This signal activates the solenoid, shifting the internal mechanism. A problem with this valve means your heat pump cannot switch modes correctly. This leads to issues like no heating or no cooling when needed.

### Common Symptoms of a Failing Reversing Valve

Recognizing symptoms of a bad reversing valve helps you diagnose the problem. Your heat pump may only provide one mode, either heating or cooling. For example, it might blow cold air in heating mode or warm air in cooling mode. This is a primary sign of valve failure. A heat pump that cannot keep up with demand might also indicate an issue. You can learn more about [why my heat pump cannot keep up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-cant-my-heat-pump-keep-up).

Another symptom is unusual noises. You might hear a loud whooshing or hissing sound from the outdoor unit. This noise occurs when the valve tries to shift but gets stuck. Sometimes, the heat pump might short cycle, turning on and off too frequently. This happens because the system struggles to reach the set temperature. If your heat pump is not turning on, this might also indicate an issue with the valve, among other things. Check out [why is my heat pump not turning on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-heat-pump-not-turning-on) for general troubleshooting.

*   **No Heating or Cooling:** System blows air, but it is the wrong temperature for the selected mode.
*   **Constant Mode:** Heat pump stays stuck in heating or cooling, regardless of thermostat setting.
*   **Loud Hissing/Whooshing:** Noise from the outdoor unit as the valve attempts to shift.
*   **Short Cycling:** Heat pump frequently turns on and off without reaching temperature.
*   **Iced Outdoor Coil:** During heating mode, the outdoor coil might freeze excessively.

### Safety Precautions Before You Start

Working with any appliance requires safety. Heat pumps involve electricity and refrigerant under pressure. Ignoring safety steps can cause injury or damage. Always prioritize your well-being. Start by turning off power to the outdoor unit. Find the disconnect switch near the unit or turn off the breaker at your electrical panel. This prevents accidental startup during your inspection.

Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Safety glasses protect your eyes from debris or refrigerant splashes. Work gloves protect your hands from sharp edges and heat. Ensure the unit has completely powered down before touching anything. This includes waiting a few minutes after turning off the breaker. Never try to force parts or bypass safety features. If you feel unsure, contact a certified HVAC technician.

*   **Disconnect Power:** Turn off the circuit breaker for your heat pump at the main electrical panel.
*   **Verify Power Off:** Use a voltage tester to confirm no power reaches the outdoor unit.
*   **Wear PPE:** Put on safety glasses and work gloves before proceeding.
*   **Allow Cool Down:** Give the unit a few minutes to fully discharge any stored energy.
*   **No Forcing:** Never force components or attempt repairs beyond your skill level.

### Visual Inspection of the Reversing Valve

Begin your check with a visual inspection. Look for obvious signs of damage or wear on the valve itself. The reversing valve is typically a brass or copper component with several refrigerant lines connected to it. It also has a small solenoid coil attached. Check the solenoid for any cracks or signs of burning. A burnt solenoid coil often indicates an electrical issue.

Examine the refrigerant lines connected to the valve. Look for any signs of leaks, such as oily residue or corrosion. A refrigerant leak near the valve suggests a seal failure. Also, check the electrical wires connected to the solenoid. Ensure they are securely attached and not frayed. Loose or damaged wires prevent the solenoid from receiving power. A thorough visual check often reveals problems early.

*   **Locate the Valve:** Find the large brass or copper valve inside the outdoor unit.
*   **Inspect Solenoid Coil:** Look for any visible damage, cracks, or burn marks on the coil casing.
*   **Check Refrigerant Lines:** Scan for oily residue, discoloration, or frost buildup indicating a leak.
*   **Verify Wiring:** Ensure all electrical connections to the solenoid are tight and undamaged.
*   **Look for Corrosion:** Rust or corrosion on the valve body can indicate prolonged exposure to moisture or leaks.

### Performing the Listening Test

The listening test is a simple way to check reversing valve function. This test helps determine if the solenoid coil is energizing. First, restore power to your outdoor unit. Have someone else cycle the thermostat between heating and cooling modes. As they switch modes, stand by the outdoor unit. Listen carefully for a distinct "click" sound.

This click comes from the solenoid coil activating. It signals that the solenoid tries to move the valve. A clear click suggests the solenoid receives power and is attempting to shift. No click indicates an electrical issue with the solenoid or its wiring. A faint click or a hum without a full shift suggests a mechanical problem within the valve or a weak solenoid. Perform this test a few times to confirm your findings.

*   **Restore Power:** Turn the circuit breaker for the heat pump back on.
*   **Set Thermostat to Heat:** Go inside and set your thermostat to heat mode, ensuring the fan is on.
*   **Listen for Click:** Stand near the outdoor unit and listen for a "click" from the reversing valve.
*   **Set Thermostat to Cool:** Change the thermostat to cool mode.
*   **Listen Again:** Listen for another distinct "click" as the valve attempts to shift back.

### Feeling the Refrigerant Lines (Temperature Test)

The temperature test helps confirm if refrigerant is flowing correctly. This test indicates if the valve is shifting. **Crucially, ensure the heat pump has run in the desired mode for at least 5-10 minutes.** This allows refrigerant temperatures to stabilize. Locate the four refrigerant lines connected to the reversing valve. One is the suction line (largest), and three are discharge lines.

In cooling mode, the large suction line should feel cool. One of the smaller lines should also feel cool (the liquid line), while the other two should feel warm (hot gas lines). In heating mode, the large suction line should feel warm/hot, and the other lines will reflect this change. A faulty valve will show little to no temperature difference between the lines. They might all feel similar, or the wrong lines might be hot/cold. An inverter heat pump system works similarly. You can learn more about [what is an inverter heat pump system](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-is-an-inverter-heat-pump-system).

*   **Run System in Cooling Mode:** Let the heat pump operate in cooling mode for 5-10 minutes.
*   **Feel Lines in Cooling:**
    *   The largest line (suction line) entering the valve should be cool.
    *   One smaller line leaving the valve (liquid line to indoor coil) should also be cool.
    *   The other two smaller lines (hot gas lines) should be warm.
*   **Run System in Heating Mode:** Switch to heating mode and run for another 5-10 minutes.
*   **Feel Lines in Heating:**
    *   The largest line (suction line) entering the valve should be warm/hot.
    *   The line that was cool in cooling mode should now be warm/hot.
    *   The lines that were warm should now be cool.
*   **Identify Discrepancies:** If lines maintain the same temperature across modes, the valve is stuck.

### Electrical Test of the Solenoid Coil (Multimeter)

An electrical test on the solenoid coil checks its integrity. This test requires a multimeter. First, **disconnect all power to the outdoor unit** again. Locate the two wires connected to the solenoid coil. Carefully remove these wires. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) setting. Place one probe on each terminal of the solenoid coil.

A working solenoid coil should show a resistance reading. The specific resistance value varies by manufacturer, but it usually falls between 10 to 30 ohms. Check your heat pump's manual for the exact specification. A reading of zero (0) ohms indicates a short circuit. An infinite reading (OL or open loop) means the coil is open, or broken. Both zero and infinite readings mean the solenoid coil is faulty and needs replacement. Remember to check if your heat pump is O or B type, as this can affect wiring diagrams.

*   **Disconnect Power:** Turn off the breaker to the outdoor unit.
*   **Access Solenoid Wires:** Locate the solenoid coil on the reversing valve and disconnect its two wires.
*   **Set Multimeter:** Set your multimeter to the ohms (Ω) scale.
*   **Measure Resistance:** Place one multimeter probe on each of the solenoid coil terminals.
*   **Interpret Reading:**
    *   **Good:** A reading between 10-30 ohms (check manufacturer specs).
    *   **Bad (Short):** A reading of 0 ohms.
    *   **Bad (Open):** An infinite reading (OL or Open Loop).
