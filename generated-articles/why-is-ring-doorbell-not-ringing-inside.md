Your Ring Doorbell is not ringing inside usually due to incorrect app settings, power supply issues to your existing chime, poor Wi-Fi connection, or compatibility problems with your indoor chime kit. Addressing these common factors helps restore functionality.

## The Chime Connection: Why Your Ring Doorbell Isn't Ringing Inside

Your Ring Doorbell connects to your home's existing chime or a separate Ring Chime device. This connection makes your doorbell ring inside. When the indoor chime does not sound, it often means a break in this communication. We need to check both your home's traditional chime and any Ring Chime devices.

Many people connect their Ring Doorbell to their existing wired doorbell system. The Ring device uses the power from your old doorbell wires. It also sends a signal to your traditional chime box. If the wiring is faulty or the settings are wrong, your Ring Doorbell will not ring inside. This is a common point of failure for indoor ringing.

Some Ring Doorbell models, especially battery-powered ones, may not connect to your existing chime directly. For these, or for homes without existing doorbell wiring, a Ring Chime device is necessary. A Ring Chime is a separate device you plug into an outlet. It acts as an indoor receiver for your doorbell alerts. Make sure it is set up correctly and connected to your Wi-Fi.

Understanding how your specific Ring Doorbell model is supposed to interact with an indoor chime helps. Wired models need correct voltage and a compatible chime kit selected in the app. Battery models usually rely on a separate Ring Chime. I often see people overlook which type of setup they have. For detailed steps on connecting your chime, you can refer to how to connect Ring doorbell with chime.

If your indoor chime still does not sound, consider its age and type. Older mechanical chimes might have issues with the low voltage from some Ring doorbells. Digital chimes need specific settings within the Ring app to work right. We must ensure the Ring Doorbell sends the correct signal to trigger your chime.

## App Settings Check: Fixing No Indoor Ring Notifications

One of the first places to look when your Ring Doorbell is not ringing inside is the Ring app. The app controls many functions of your doorbell, including indoor chime alerts. Incorrect settings here are a frequent cause of no indoor sound. We need to make sure your app is telling your chime to ring.

Open your Ring app on your smartphone or tablet. Tap on the three lines at the top left, then select "Devices." Find your Ring Doorbell in the list and tap on it. This takes you to its specific device settings.

Inside the device settings, look for "In-Home Chime" or "Chime Kit Settings." You might also see "Internal Doorbell" as an option. Make sure this setting is enabled or toggled to "on." If it is off, your Ring Doorbell will not send a signal to your traditional chime.

For homes with an existing wired chime, you also need to select the correct chime type within these settings. Ring Doorbells support both "Mechanical" and "Digital" chimes. Selecting the wrong type can prevent your indoor chime from ringing. If you have a traditional bell-and-hammer chime, choose "Mechanical." If your chime plays a melody or a sound file, choose "Digital." I have seen many cases where this simple setting fixes the problem instantly.

Additionally, check the "Ring Alerts" setting for your Ring Doorbell. While this mainly affects phone notifications, it is good to confirm it is enabled. If your Ring Doorbell only rings on your phone, then adjusting these indoor chime settings is key. You can also explore how to change the doorbell sound on Ring to ensure your chime is functioning properly, which requires the indoor chime setting to be correct first. Finally, if you are not getting any notifications, including indoor chime and phone alerts, check your notification settings in the Ring app and your phone settings, as discussed in detail on why is my Ring Doorbell not notifying me.

## Power and Wiring Problems Preventing Your Indoor Chime

For wired Ring Doorbell models, power supply and wiring are critical for your indoor chime to work. The Ring Doorbell uses power from your existing doorbell wires. It also sends a signal back through these wires to trigger your home's traditional chime. If the power is too low or the wiring has issues, your Ring Doorbell will not ring inside.

First, check your doorbell transformer. The transformer converts your home's high voltage electricity to the low voltage needed for your doorbell system. Most Ring Doorbells need a transformer that provides 16-24 Volts AC. If your transformer is old or provides less voltage, it might not supply enough power for both the Ring Doorbell and your indoor chime. This is a common cause of chime failure.

Next, inspect the wiring itself. Loose wires at the doorbell button, at the chime box, or at the transformer can disrupt the circuit. Turn off the power at your breaker box before checking any wires. Carefully tighten any loose screws connecting the wires. Look for any frayed or broken wires that might prevent the current from flowing correctly.

Sometimes, the chime box itself is the problem. Dust, debris, or old age can cause the chime mechanism to fail. If you have a mechanical chime, the plungers or bells might be stuck. For digital chimes, the circuit board could be faulty. Testing the chime with a simple button (if you have one) can help isolate if the chime unit is truly broken.

If your Ring Doorbell is a battery model, it does not use your existing wiring for power. However, you might have it connected to your existing chime using a Ring Chime Connector. This small device ensures proper power distribution. Make sure the Ring Chime Connector is installed correctly and its wires are secure. Problems here can also stop your traditional chime from ringing. Ensuring proper power is crucial.

## Wi-Fi Glitches: Impacting Your Ring Doorbell's Indoor Ringing

A strong and stable Wi-Fi connection is essential for your Ring Doorbell's full functionality. While the doorbell button might still work, a poor Wi-Fi signal can prevent the Ring app from communicating with your device. This can stop indoor chime alerts, even if your physical chime works otherwise. Your Ring Doorbell needs good Wi-Fi to send signals to your Ring Chime or to communicate its status to the app for wired chime control.

Check your Wi-Fi signal strength in the Ring app. Go to your doorbellâ€™s device health section. It will show you the signal strength, often called RSSI. A lower negative number (e.g., -30) means a strong signal. A higher negative number (e.g., -60 or more negative) indicates a weak signal. A weak signal makes it difficult for your doorbell to communicate reliably.

If your signal is weak, move your Wi-Fi router closer to the doorbell if possible. Or, consider using a Wi-Fi extender or mesh system. These devices boost your Wi-Fi signal to reach areas that your router cannot cover well. Interference from other wireless devices or neighboring Wi-Fi networks can also weaken your signal. Try changing your router's Wi-Fi channel if you suspect interference.

A common issue is the Ring Doorbell struggling to connect to Wi-Fi at all. If your doorbell won't connect to Wi-Fi, it cannot send the signal to your indoor chime. This is a primary reason why your Ring Doorbell might not be ringing inside. You should also ensure your Wi-Fi network uses a compatible frequency, usually 2.4 GHz for most Ring devices. Some Ring devices support 5 GHz, but 2.4 GHz generally offers better range.

Sometimes, a simple router restart can fix Wi-Fi issues. Unplug your router for 30 seconds, then plug it back in. This often clears network glitches. Reconnecting your Ring Doorbell to Wi-Fi after a router restart may be necessary. Ensure your network password has not changed.

## Chime Kit Compatibility and Installation Errors

Ring Doorbells work with most existing doorbell systems, but compatibility matters. Selecting the correct chime type in the Ring app is vital. Incorrectly configured settings or improper installation of a chime kit can stop your Ring Doorbell from ringing inside. This is particularly true for wired setups.

When you install a wired Ring Doorbell, you tell the app if your existing chime is "Mechanical" or "Digital." A mechanical chime has a physical hammer that strikes metal bars. A digital chime plays pre-recorded sounds through a speaker. Selecting the wrong type can cause the chime to not ring or to buzz constantly. Always confirm your chime type before selecting it in the Ring app.

Some wired Ring Doorbell models require a "chime bypass kit" or "pro power kit." This small device wires into your existing chime box. It ensures the correct power flow to the Ring Doorbell while allowing the chime to still ring. If this kit is missing, installed incorrectly, or has failed, your indoor chime will not work. Check the installation guide for your specific Ring Doorbell model to see if this kit is necessary.

Another common installation error is incorrect wiring at the chime box itself. During setup, wires might become loose or connected to the wrong terminals. Turn off power at the breaker before checking the wires. Ensure the wires are securely fastened to the "front" and "transformer" terminals on your chime. Loose connections prevent the chime from receiving the activation signal.

If you recently set up your Ring Doorbell or had work done near the chime, re-verify the wiring. Sometimes, an old chime might develop internal faults. If the chime itself is very old, it might struggle to work with a new smart doorbell. Replacing an old, worn-out chime with a new, compatible one can resolve lingering issues. For a fresh setup, you might find guidance on how to set up Ring Doorbell that is already installed helpful.

## Resetting and Reconnecting Your Ring Doorbell for Indoor Sound

When troubleshooting other issues has not worked, resetting your Ring Doorbell can often resolve hidden problems. A reset clears out temporary glitches and allows the device to reconnect cleanly. There are two main types of resets: a soft reset and a hard reset. I recommend trying a soft reset first, as it is less disruptive.

To perform a soft reset, simply hold down the orange button on the back of your Ring Doorbell (or the setup button on the front, depending on the model) for about 10-15 seconds. The light ring on the front of your doorbell will flash. Release the button, and the doorbell will restart. After it restarts, test the indoor chime. This often fixes minor software bugs.

If a soft reset does not help, a hard reset might be necessary. A hard reset restores your Ring Doorbell to its factory default settings. This means you will need to set it up again as if it were a new device. To perform a hard reset, hold down the setup button for 20 seconds. The light ring will flash, indicating it is resetting. After 20 seconds, release the button.

Once the hard reset is complete, you will need to go through the setup process again in the Ring app. This includes reconnecting it to your Wi-Fi network and configuring your indoor chime settings. Make sure to select the correct chime type (mechanical or digital) and enable the in-home chime. While this takes a bit more time, it often fixes persistent problems.

After any reset, verify that your Ring Doorbell successfully reconnects to your Wi-Fi network. Check the device health in the Ring app to ensure a strong signal strength. Then, press the doorbell button to test if your Ring Doorbell is now ringing inside. This systematic approach helps rule out device-specific glitches.

## Advanced Troubleshooting: When Your Ring Doorbell Still Won't Ring Inside

If your Ring Doorbell still does not ring inside after trying all the basic steps, we need to dig deeper. Sometimes, the problem is more subtle than a simple setting or Wi-Fi issue. I have found that these advanced steps can uncover the root cause.

First, check for firmware updates. Ring regularly releases software updates for its devices. These updates improve performance and fix bugs. Your Ring Doorbell usually updates automatically. However, if your device has been offline or has a weak connection, it might miss an update. You can check for pending updates in the Ring app's device health section. Ensure your doorbell runs the latest firmware.

Consider the age and condition of your existing chime unit. Old chimes, especially mechanical ones, can wear out. The internal components might be stuck or broken. Even if your transformer provides enough voltage, a faulty chime unit will not ring. If you have a multimeter, you can test the voltage at the chime terminals when the doorbell button is pressed. This confirms if the signal reaches the chime. If it does, but the chime does not sound, the chime unit itself is likely the problem.

Environmental factors can also play a role. Extreme temperatures or moisture can affect the doorbell or wiring over time. While less common, physical damage to the doorbell unit or the wiring can prevent the chime from working. Look for any visible signs of damage.

If you have tried everything and your Ring Doorbell is still not ringing inside, it is time to contact Ring support. They have specialized diagnostic tools and can walk you through more specific troubleshooting steps. They can also determine if your device is faulty and needs replacement. For complex electrical issues, like a faulty transformer or hidden wiring problems, you might need to consult a licensed electrician. Electrical work can be dangerous, so it is best to leave it to professionals.
