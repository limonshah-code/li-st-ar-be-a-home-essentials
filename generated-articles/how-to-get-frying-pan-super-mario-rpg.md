This article details every step. We will cover the prerequisites, the specific location in Booster Tower, and the important trade you must make. By the end, you will understand its power and how to equip this fantastic item. Get ready to strengthen your team in this classic RPG!

### Takeaway

Acquiring the Frying Pan for Peach in Super Mario RPG involves clear steps. You must find a specific item and trade it at the right time. Here is a brief summary:

*   Progress through the game's story to reach Booster Tower.
*   Locate the "Moldy Mush" in a specific hidden chest within Booster Tower.
*   After Booster Tower, proceed to Marrymore.
*   Trade the Moldy Mush with the Chef in the Marrymore hotel.
*   Equip the Frying Pan to Princess Peach for a massive stat boost.

### Main Query Answer

To get the Frying Pan in Super Mario RPG, acquire the "Moldy Mush" from a hidden treasure chest in Booster Tower. Then, proceed to Marrymore after the Booster Tower events. Trade the Moldy Mush with the Chef inside the Marrymore hotel to receive the Frying Pan, Peach's ultimate weapon.

## The Frying Pan: Peach's Ultimate Weapon in Super Mario RPG

The Frying Pan is not just any item in Super Mario RPG. It is Princess Peach's most powerful weapon. Many players seek this item to maximize her combat potential. Getting the Frying Pan allows Peach to deal much higher physical damage than with her other weapons.

This significant damage boost makes a real difference in later battles. Peach often acts as a healer and support character. However, with the Frying Pan, she becomes a capable attacker. This changes party dynamics and opens new strategies for combat.

Having Peach deal significant damage frees up other characters. Mario or Geno can focus on different roles. The Frying Pan also has a high critical hit rate. This means Peach can sometimes inflict double damage. It is a game-changer for boss fights and tough enemy encounters. I always make sure to grab this weapon for Peach.

## Why the Frying Pan Stands Out for Peach

The Frying Pan offers unparalleled attack power for Princess Peach. It provides a staggering +90 attack bonus. This bonus is far greater than any other weapon Peach can equip in the game. It makes her physically powerful, an unexpected role for her.

Before the Frying Pan, Peach's weapons offer modest attack increases. For instance, her early weapons might provide +10 or +20 attack. The jump to +90 is a monumental shift. It literally changes her from a weak attacker to a powerhouse. This makes her active offensive ability much more reliable.

Beyond raw power, the Frying Pan has a hidden property. It grants a higher critical hit chance than other weapons. This means Peach's attacks have a better chance of dealing double damage. Imagine hitting a boss for massive damage with Peach. It is very satisfying.

Many Super Mario RPG players prioritize getting this item early. They understand its impact on battle efficiency. For those who enjoy optimizing their party, the Frying Pan is essential. It lets Peach contribute significantly to damage output, not just healing.

## The Journey Begins: Before Booster Tower

Your quest to get the Frying Pan Super Mario RPG weapon starts long before you reach Booster Tower. The game's story progresses through several key locations. You must complete specific events and recruit certain characters. This ensures you are ready for the challenges ahead.

You will have already explored the Mushroom Kingdom and met Mallow. Soon after, you will encounter the mysterious Geno. These two characters join your party. Their unique abilities are crucial for upcoming battles. Make sure your team is well-equipped before moving forward.

The path to Booster Tower opens after you finish your business in Moleville. You will pass through a forest area before reaching the tower itself. This section of the game focuses on advancing the plot towards the wedding events. This is a critical story point.

Reaching Booster Tower signifies you are close to getting the Frying Pan. You are on the right track if you have fought Croco a second time. This part of the journey prepares you for the next critical step. Players often feel excited when they reach this point.

## Infiltrating Booster Tower: Locating the Moldy Mush

Booster Tower is a peculiar and exciting location in Super Mario RPG. It is the home of the eccentric Booster. This tower holds the key to getting the Frying Pan. Your primary goal here is to find a specific item: the Moldy Mush.

### Navigating the Tower's Challenges

Booster Tower has multiple floors and various enemies. You will encounter many Boos, Spookies, and other unique foes. Some areas require precise jumps or avoiding traps. Keep your party's HP up and use healing items as needed. The tower is not overly difficult, but it can be tricky.

You will also meet Booster's loyal companions, the Booster Guards. They appear in different rooms. You must either fight them or outsmart them. Progress through the tower by finding levers and opening gates. Always check behind curtains or in hidden corners for items. This tower is full of surprises.

One memorable part involves avoiding Booster himself. He rolls down the stairs in a barrel. If you get hit, you lose coins. Try to hide in the side rooms to avoid him. This adds a fun, lighthearted element to the tower's exploration. Staying hidden ensures a smooth journey.

### Pinpointing the Hidden Chest

The Moldy Mush is in a very specific treasure chest. This chest is located near the top of Booster Tower. You will find it just before the room where Booster prepares his "wedding" plans. Look for a room with a long platform and several treasure chests.

There are many chests in this area. Some contain coins, others contain recovery items, and one holds the rare "Croaka Cola." The key is to find the hidden chest that is not immediately visible. This chest is on a high ledge. It requires a bit of platforming to reach.

Jump onto the visible chests to reach higher ground. From there, you can jump towards the back wall or side of the room. A hidden path often leads to the specific chest. If you are having trouble, look for any suspicious-looking ledges or shadows. The Moldy Mush is worth the effort to find.

Once you jump and reach the hidden platform, the chest will be there. Open it to claim the Moldy Mush. This item looks like a simple, old mushroom, but it is incredibly valuable. Do not use it or sell it! Keep it safe in your inventory. This seemingly useless item holds the key to Peach's ultimate weapon. Just like some game items are made from combining elements, this item is part of a trade, much like you might learn how to make frying pan in Little Alchemy 2. Remember, its true value is in what it can become.

## The Marrymore Connection: Trading with the Chef

After your adventures in Booster Tower, the story leads you to Marrymore. This vibrant town is where the "wedding" between Booster and Princess Peach is supposed to happen. It is also the place where you complete the Frying Pan acquisition. You will find the Chef inside the Marrymore hotel.

### The Marrymore Culinary Scene

Marrymore is a beautiful, lively town. Its main attraction is the grand Marrymore hotel. Inside, the staff is bustling. They are preparing a massive wedding cake. This cake is central to the next major boss battle. You must first deal with the events involving the cake.

After the Booster Tower sequence, Mario and his friends arrive in Marrymore. They stop Booster's plans. The wedding cake becomes a living monster called Bundt or the "Countdown Cake." You must defeat this boss. This is a challenging fight requiring good timing with action commands.

Once you defeat the cake, the hotel chef will be very grateful. He can finally relax. This is when your opportunity arises. The Chef is now available to help you with your Moldy Mush. This interaction is easy to miss if you rush out. Take your time and talk to everyone.

### The Chef's Demand and Your Offering

Go to the kitchen area of the Marrymore hotel. The Chef is usually standing there. Talk to him. He might mention his appreciation or express relief. During your conversation, an option to trade will appear. This is your chance to offer the Moldy Mush.

The Chef is an enthusiast for rare ingredients. He finds the Moldy Mush fascinating. He will offer to trade you a unique item in return for it. This trade is fixed. He will always give you the Frying Pan. It is a simple exchange, but crucial.

Select the Moldy Mush from your inventory. Confirm the trade. The Chef will take the mush. In return, he hands you the Frying Pan. It feels great when you get this item. You have now successfully acquired Princess Peach's ultimate weapon.

You do not need to pay anything for this trade. It is a straightforward swap. The Chef values the Moldy Mush for its uniqueness. Make sure you do not accidentally sell or use the Moldy Mush before this point. It is a one-time acquisition. Getting this weapon helps you keep your party's equipment pristine, much like knowing [how to clean frying pans](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-frying-pans) for real-world use. This attention to detail improves your overall experience.

## Unleashing Peach's Power: Equipping and Using the Frying Pan

Once you have the Frying Pan, the next step is simple: equip it to Princess Peach. This immediate action transforms her role in combat. You will see a significant boost in her attack power. This makes her a valuable asset in ways you might not expect.

To equip the Frying Pan, open your menu. Navigate to the "Equip" section. Select Peach. Then, choose the "Weapon" slot. The Frying Pan will appear in your inventory list if you followed the steps correctly. Select it to equip it to Peach.

You will notice her Attack stat surge. This is the direct result of the Frying Pan's high power. Her physical attacks will now deal substantial damage. This weapon is especially effective against enemies with lower defense. It makes quick work of common foes.

In boss battles, Peach can now contribute to damage output. This lessens the burden on Mario and Geno. You can use Peach's regular attacks more often. She can still heal when needed, but she is no longer limited to that role. This versatility enhances your combat strategy. For example, during a tough battle, Peach might deliver the final blow. I found this incredibly helpful in difficult boss fights. It is exciting to see Peach deal high damage.

## Maximizing Your Arsenal: Beyond the Frying Pan

While getting the Frying Pan Super Mario RPG is a huge step for Peach, remember to optimize your entire team. Super Mario RPG offers ultimate weapons for every character. These weapons are often hidden or require specific quests. Focusing on collecting them all prepares you for the toughest challenges.

For Mario, his ultimate weapon is the Lazy Shell. This powerful weapon has high attack and a special property. It does not miss. You get it from a secret trading sequence involving a Seed and a Fertilizer. This weapon makes Mario an unstoppable force.

Geno's best weapon is the Star Hand. This weapon boosts his attack significantly. You can purchase it in Nimbus Land later in the game. Equipping it enhances his powerful special attacks. Geno Whirl and Geno Flash become even more devastating.

Mallow's ultimate weapon is the Froggie Stick. You get it by returning the Cricket Pie to Frogfucius. This weapon helps Mallow's magical attacks. While Mallow focuses on magic, this weapon adds a nice physical boost. It ensures he contributes in all ways.

Bowser's best weapon is the Drill Claw. You find it in the Bowser's Keep area. It gives Bowser a huge attack boost. He already has high physical power. This weapon makes him even stronger. Bowser becomes a tank with this equip.

Collecting these ultimate weapons requires exploration and attention to detail. Just like understanding [how to clean non-stick frying pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-non-stick-frying-pan) for longevity, knowing where to find these game items ensures your team's peak performance. Always check shops, talk to NPCs, and look for hidden paths. A fully equipped team makes the final challenges much easier. Your efforts in gathering these items will pay off during endgame content.
