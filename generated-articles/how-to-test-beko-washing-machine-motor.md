## How To Test Beko Washing Machine Motor

Is your Beko washing machine struggling to spin or not moving at all? A malfunctioning motor might be the cause. Knowing how to test a Beko washing machine motor can save you time and money. This guide helps you diagnose the issue yourself.

I understand the frustration of a laundry pile growing bigger each day. A washing machine that doesn't work properly feels like a major household crisis. Testing the motor is a crucial step in troubleshooting. You will learn the process from start to finish.

This article provides a clear, step-by-step approach to testing your Beko washing machine's motor. We will cover safety, preparation, different motor types, and how to interpret your findings. With the right information, you can decide whether to repair or replace.

### Takeaway

*   Always disconnect power before starting any work on your washing machine.
*   Identify your Beko's motor type (carbon brush or brushless) for correct testing.
*   Use a multimeter to check for continuity and resistance in motor components.
*   Visual inspections can reveal obvious damage or worn parts like carbon brushes.
*   Understand test results to determine if the motor is faulty or if another component is failing.

To test your Beko washing machine motor, disconnect power, access the motor, and use a multimeter to check for continuity and resistance in its windings and components like carbon brushes or hall sensors, depending on the motor type. Compare readings to manufacturer specifications to identify faults.

## Understanding Your Beko Washing Machine Motor

Your Beko washing machine relies heavily on its motor to spin the drum. This essential component comes in a few different types. Understanding these types helps you know what to look for when testing. Each motor operates differently and has specific test points.

Knowing your motor type ensures you follow the correct diagnostic steps. Common symptoms of a failing motor include the drum not spinning, unusual noises during spin cycles, or the machine stopping mid-cycle. Sometimes, the machine might not start at all.

### Types of Beko Washing Machine Motors

Older Beko washing machines often use a **carbon brush motor**. These motors have physical carbon brushes that conduct electricity to the motor's rotor. Over time, these brushes wear down, causing motor issues. This is a very common failure point.

Newer Beko models frequently feature an **inverter motor**, also known as a brushless DC motor. These motors are more efficient and quieter because they do not use carbon brushes. Instead, they use electronic controls to regulate power. They are generally more reliable but can still fail.

A faulty motor can also cause your machine to trip the electrical circuit. If your Beko washing machine keeps tripping the electric, the motor could be drawing too much current due to an internal fault. Identifying the motor type is the first step in effective troubleshooting. This prepares you for the specific testing procedures ahead.

## Safety First: Preparing for Beko Motor Testing

Before you begin any diagnostic work, safety must be your top priority. Electricity and water are a dangerous combination. Taking proper precautions prevents injury and protects your appliance. I always ensure the machine is completely depowered before touching anything.

Failure to follow safety guidelines can lead to severe electric shock. This step is non-negotiable for any appliance repair. You want to focus on fixing the problem, not creating a new one.

### Essential Safety Steps

1.  **Unplug the Machine:** Locate the power cord and pull it directly from the wall outlet. Do not just turn off the machine; physically remove the plug. This completely disconnects the power supply.
2.  **Turn Off Water Supply:** Close the hot and cold water supply valves behind the washing machine. This prevents water from leaking if you need to disconnect hoses. Sometimes, you might need to drain the machine before opening it up. If your Beko washing machine won't drain, address that first to prevent spills. [How To Drain Your Beko Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-your-beko-washing-machine) offers guidance here.
3.  **Gather Tools:** Collect all necessary tools before you start. You will need a multimeter, screwdrivers (Phillips and flathead), a socket set, pliers, and possibly a flashlight. Having everything ready streamlines the process.
4.  **Wear Protective Gear:** Consider wearing work gloves to protect your hands from sharp edges. Safety glasses are also a good idea to shield your eyes from debris or springs. These simple items can prevent minor injuries.

Remember, if you are uncomfortable at any point, stop and consider professional help. Your safety is worth more than any repair cost. Proceed only when you feel confident and prepared.

## Preliminary Checks for a Faulty Beko Motor

Before you dive into testing the motor itself, perform some basic checks. Often, a problem that seems like a motor failure is actually caused by something simpler. These preliminary steps can save you time and effort. I always start with the easiest solutions first.

Sometimes, a simple reset can resolve seemingly complex issues. Other times, a minor component might be at fault. Ruling out these common culprits helps narrow down the problem. This systematic approach prevents unnecessary dismantling of your washing machine.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1.  **Power Supply:** Ensure the machine is receiving power. Check the wall outlet with another appliance. If your Beko washing machine is not turning on, confirm the circuit breaker has not tripped. [Why Is My Beko Washing Machine Not Turning On](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-beko-washing-machine-not-turning-on) provides more details on power issues.
2.  **Door Lock Mechanism:** A faulty door lock can prevent the machine from starting its cycle, mimicking a motor issue. The machine's safety features will stop it from spinning if the door is not securely latched. If your Beko washing machine door is not opening, the lock mechanism might be stuck or broken. You can sometimes put the machine into a test mode to diagnose these issues. [How To Put Beko Washing Machine Into Test Mode](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-put-beko-washing-machine-into-test-mode) can help here.
3.  **Drive Belt:** For carbon brush motors, a drive belt connects the motor to the drum. If this belt is broken or slipped off, the motor will run, but the drum won't spin. Visually inspect the belt's condition by manually turning the drum; if it spins freely with no resistance, the belt might be the culprit.
4.  **Overload Protection:** Some motors have an internal thermal overload protector. This device trips if the motor overheats. It resets automatically once the motor cools down. If your machine stops suddenly and then starts again later, this could be the reason.
5.  **Control Board (PCB) Issues:** While less common, a malfunctioning control board can send incorrect signals to the motor, or no signals at all. If preliminary checks do not reveal an obvious fault, and the motor tests good, the control board might be the next area to investigate.
6.  **Motor Carbon Brushes:** Even before a multimeter test, a simple visual inspection of carbon brushes (on brush motors) can show if they are severely worn. Short brushes cannot make proper contact. This is a very common reason for motors to fail or spin intermittently.

Addressing these simpler issues first can often fix your Beko washing machine without needing to delve into complex motor diagnostics. If these checks don't solve the problem, then it's time to test the motor itself.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Accessing the Beko Washing Machine Motor

Accessing the motor is a crucial step before you can begin testing it. The location of the motor can vary slightly depending on your Beko washing machine model. Most front-load machines have the motor at the back or bottom. Top-load machines usually have it at the bottom.

Always refer to your specific Beko model's service manual if available for precise instructions. However, the general procedure is similar for most units. I find it helpful to take pictures as I go. This makes reassembly much easier later.

### Locating and Removing the Motor

1.  **Move the Machine:** Pull your Beko washing machine away from the wall. This provides enough space to work comfortably behind or around it. Ensure the power cord is completely unplugged and water supply turned off.
2.  **Remove the Back Panel:** For most front-load Beko washing machines, the motor is accessed by removing the rear panel. Use a screwdriver or socket wrench to unscrew the fasteners holding this panel in place. Carefully lift the panel away and set it aside.
3.  **Identify the Motor:** Once the back panel is off, you will see various components. The motor is typically a large, cylindrical component mounted near the bottom of the drum. It might have a drive belt connected to a pulley on the drum (for carbon brush motors) or be directly attached (for inverter motors).
4.  **Disconnect Electrical Connections:** Before removing the motor, carefully disconnect all electrical connectors attached to it. These are usually plastic plugs or spade connectors. Take note of where each wire connects. Some connectors might have small clips that need to be pressed to release them.
5.  **Remove the Drive Belt (if applicable):** If your machine has a carbon brush motor, you will need to remove the drive belt from the motor pulley. This usually involves manually rolling the belt off the pulley while turning the drum.
6.  **Unbolt the Motor:** The motor is secured to the washing machine frame with several bolts. Use the appropriate size socket wrench to loosen and remove these bolts. Support the motor as you remove the last bolt to prevent it from dropping.
7.  **Carefully Remove the Motor:** Once unbolted and disconnected, carefully slide or lift the motor out of its mounting bracket. Place it on a clean, stable surface where you can perform your tests. You now have clear access for detailed inspection and testing.

Taking your time with this step prevents damage to other components. With the motor removed, you are ready for the specific diagnostic tests.

## Testing a Carbon Brush Motor on Your Beko Washing Machine

Carbon brush motors are common in many Beko washing machines. These motors rely on carbon brushes to transfer electrical current to the spinning armature. Over time, these brushes wear down, which is a frequent cause of motor failure. I have seen many cases where replacing brushes brings the motor back to life.

Testing a carbon brush motor involves checking its key components. You will need a multimeter set to measure resistance (Ohms) and continuity. This helps determine if current can flow correctly through the motor's internal parts. A systematic approach ensures accurate diagnosis.

### Visual Inspection of Carbon Brushes

1.  **Locate the Brushes:** Carbon brushes are typically found in holders on the sides of the motor, usually at the rear. They are small, rectangular carbon blocks, each with a wire attached. You might need to unscrew or unclip their holders to remove them.
2.  **Check Brush Length:** Examine the length of the carbon part. New brushes are usually about 1.5 to 2 cm long. If a brush is worn down to less than 0.5 cm, it's too short to make proper contact with the commutator. Worn brushes are a primary reason for motors not to spin.
3.  **Inspect for Damage:** Look for any chips, cracks, or excessive burning on the carbon brushes. Ensure the spring behind the brush still provides good pressure. If the brushes look worn or damaged, replace them.

### Checking Commutator

1.  **Locate the Commutator:** The commutator is the copper part of the motor that the carbon brushes press against. It's usually visible once the brushes are removed.
2.  **Inspect Surface:** Look for signs of pitting, grooving, or excessive blackening on the copper surface. A smooth, clean copper surface is ideal. Rough or burnt areas indicate poor brush contact or arcing.
3.  **Clean if Necessary:** If the commutator is dirty but not severely damaged, you can gently clean it with a fine-grit sandpaper or a special commutator cleaning stick. Avoid using harsh chemicals.

### Armature Winding Test (Continuity/Resistance)

1.  **Set Multimeter:** Set your multimeter to the resistance (Ohms) setting, or continuity mode.
2.  **Test Brush Holders:** Place one probe on the metal contact inside one carbon brush holder. Place the other probe on the metal contact inside the other brush holder. You should read a resistance value, typically between 1-10 Ohms. If you get an open circuit (OL or infinite resistance), there's a break in the armature winding. If you get zero resistance, there might be a short circuit.
3.  **Test Commutator Segments:** You can also test individual segments of the commutator. Place one probe on one copper segment and the other probe on an adjacent segment. You should get a small, consistent resistance reading between all segments. Inconsistent readings or open circuits suggest internal winding damage.

### Tachometer Coil Test

1.  **Locate Tachometer:** The tachometer is a small sensor, usually at the rear of the motor, opposite the drive end. It has two wires coming from it. It monitors motor speed.
2.  **Test Resistance:** Disconnect the tachometer wires. Place a multimeter probe on each of the two tachometer terminals. You should read a specific resistance value, typically between 50-200 Ohms, depending on the motor model. An open circuit (OL) indicates a faulty tachometer. If the tachometer is bad, the motor might spin erratically or not at all, as the control board won't get correct speed feedback.

If any of these tests show abnormal readings, or if the carbon brushes are severely worn, the motor or its components need replacement.

## Testing an Inverter/Brushless Motor on Your Beko Washing Machine

Inverter motors, also known as brushless DC motors, are more modern and found in many newer Beko washing machines. They do not use carbon brushes, which makes them quieter and more durable. However, they can still fail. Testing these motors requires a slightly different approach compared to carbon brush motors.

These motors are typically controlled by a complex inverter board, which converts the AC power to the DC power needed for the motor. While the inverter board itself can fail, it is still possible to test the motor windings for integrity. I find these motors often fail due to winding issues or hall sensor problems.

### Visual Inspection for Damage

1.  **External Damage:** Before any electrical tests, carefully inspect the outside of the motor. Look for any signs of physical damage, such as cracks, burnt spots, or unusual discoloration. These can indicate internal issues.
2.  **Connections:** Check all electrical connectors for corrosion, loose connections, or burnt pins. A poor connection can mimic a motor failure. Ensure all wiring is intact and not frayed.

### Winding Resistance Test

1.  **Locate Motor Terminals:** Inverter motors typically have three main wires coming from the motor windings, usually connected to a multi-pin connector. These wires connect to the inverter board.
2.  **Set Multimeter:** Set your multimeter to the lowest resistance (Ohms) setting.
3.  **Test Between Phases:** Identify the three motor terminals (often labeled U, V, W or simply 1, 2, 3). Place one probe on terminal 1 and the other on terminal 2. Note the resistance. Then, test between 1 and 3, and finally between 2 and 3. All three readings should be very similar, typically a very low resistance (e.g., 0.5 to 2 Ohms).
4.  **Check for Open Circuit:** If any of the readings show an open circuit (OL or infinite resistance), it indicates a break in one of the motor windings. This means the motor is faulty and needs replacement.
5.  **Check for Short to Ground:** Place one probe on any of the motor terminals (U, V, or W) and the other probe on the metal casing of the motor. There should be no continuity or very high resistance (OL). If you read any continuity or low resistance, it indicates a short circuit to the motor casing, which is a serious fault.

### Continuity Test (Internal Connections)

1.  **Check Continuity Between Terminals:** While resistance testing is more precise, a simple continuity test can quickly identify a completely open winding. Use the continuity setting on your multimeter.
2.  **Test Pairs:** Touch the probes to each pair of the three motor terminals. You should hear a beep or see a continuity indication for all three pairs (U-V, V-W, U-W). No beep or indication on any pair means an open winding.

### Hall Sensor Test (if applicable)

1.  **Locate Hall Sensor:** Many inverter motors include a Hall sensor, which helps the control board monitor the motor's position and speed. It's usually a small separate component or part of the main connector, with typically 4 or 5 wires.
2.  **Identify Wires:** The Hall sensor usually has power (5V), ground, and signal wires. You may need a wiring diagram for your specific Beko model to identify them correctly.
3.  **Test Voltage Output (Advanced):** This test is more involved and requires the motor to be connected to power (NOT recommended for DIY unless you are very experienced and know how to safely back-probe a powered circuit). It involves checking the voltage on the signal wires as the motor is slowly turned. A simpler, though less conclusive, test is to check the resistance across its power and ground pins (when disconnected). However, if the motor windings test good, and you suspect an electronic issue, the Hall sensor or the main inverter board are likely culprits. A professional diagnostic might be best for Hall sensor issues if you're not comfortable.

If your inverter motor fails any of these winding tests, it requires replacement. These motors are generally not repairable at a component level for the average DIYer.

## Interpreting Test Results and Next Steps

Once you have completed the motor tests, it's time to interpret the results. This will guide your next steps. Understanding what the readings mean is crucial for an accurate diagnosis. I always compare my readings against what a healthy motor should show.

A faulty motor is not always the end of your Beko washing machine. Sometimes, a simple part replacement is all that's needed. Other times, a full motor replacement is the only viable option. Your findings will help you make an informed decision.

### Understanding Your Readings

*   **Carbon Brush Motor Results:**
    *   **Worn Brushes:** If brushes are less than 0.5 cm, replace them. This is often an inexpensive and easy fix.
    *   **Open Circuit in Armature (High Resistance/OL):** If your multimeter shows very high resistance or an open circuit when testing the brush holders or commutator segments, the armature windings are faulty. This usually means the motor needs to be replaced.
    *   **Short Circuit in Armature (Very Low Resistance/0 Ohms):** If resistance is near zero or indicates a direct short, the armature windings are internally shorted. This also requires motor replacement.
    *   **Faulty Tachometer (Open Circuit/OL):** If the tachometer resistance is open, replace the tachometer or the motor if it's integrated. A bad tachometer causes erratic spinning or no spin.
*   **Inverter/Brushless Motor Results:**
    *   **Unequal Winding Resistance:** If the resistance readings between the three motor terminals are not very close to each other (e.g., 0.5-2 Ohms, but consistent), or if one reads significantly higher or lower, a winding is damaged. The motor needs replacement.
    *   **Open Circuit (OL) on Windings:** If any winding test shows an open circuit, a break exists within the motor windings. The motor is faulty and needs to be replaced.
    *   **Short to Ground:** If there is continuity or very low resistance between a motor terminal and the motor casing, the motor has an internal short to ground. This is a severe fault and requires motor replacement.
    *   **Hall Sensor Issues:** If you suspect the Hall sensor (and your motor has one) and it tests faulty, replacement of the sensor or the entire motor might be necessary.

### Next Steps

1.  **Component Replacement:** If only the carbon brushes or the tachometer on a carbon brush motor are faulty, these can often be replaced individually. Source genuine Beko parts or high-quality compatible alternatives.
2.  **Motor Replacement:** If the motor windings themselves are faulty (open circuit, short circuit, or incorrect resistance), the entire motor must be replaced. Inverter motors are rarely repairable at a component level by a DIYer.
3.  **Consider Professional Help:** If you are unsure about your test results, or if the repair seems too complex, consider calling a qualified appliance technician. They have specialized tools and expertise for more complex diagnostics, such as issues with the control board. For example, if your Beko washing machine does not start, and the motor tests good, the problem might be with the main control board. [Why Does My Beko Washing Machine Not Start](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-beko-washing-machine-not-start) can offer more context.
4.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Weigh the cost of a new motor against the cost of a new washing machine. For older machines, a new motor might not be economically viable. For newer, expensive models, replacing the motor is often a sensible choice.
5.  **Reassembly:** If you are replacing parts or the motor, follow the reverse steps for reassembly. Ensure all connections are secure and the panel is properly reattached. Always run a test cycle before returning the machine to its usual spot.

Diagnosing a Beko washing machine motor requires patience and careful testing. With accurate interpretation, you can confidently decide on the best course of action for your appliance.
