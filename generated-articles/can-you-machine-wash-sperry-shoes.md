## Can You Machine Wash Sperry Shoes?

Many people own Sperry shoes. They are famous for their comfortable style. Over time, these shoes can get dirty. You might wonder if you can just toss them in the washing machine. This is a common question for many shoe owners. Learning the right way to clean your Sperry shoes helps them last longer. I will guide you through the best methods. We will look at what materials work in a machine and what do not.

This article provides clear instructions. We will cover preparation, washing, and drying steps. You will learn how to care for different Sperry materials. This includes canvas, leather, and suede. Our goal is to keep your favorite boat shoes looking great. Follow these tips to maintain your footwear properly.

### Takeaway:

*   **Machine wash canvas Sperry shoes only.** Use a gentle cycle with cold water.
*   **Do not machine wash leather or suede Sperry shoes.** These materials require hand cleaning.
*   **Always remove laces and insoles before washing.** Place shoes in a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Use a mild detergent.** Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach.
*   **Air dry all Sperry shoes.** Never put them in a machine dryer.

You can machine wash certain Sperry shoes, specifically those made of canvas. You must use a delicate cycle with cold water and mild detergent. However, you should never machine wash Sperry shoes made of leather, suede, or other delicate materials. These types need special hand cleaning to prevent damage.

## Understanding Your Sperry Shoes: Materials Matter for Cleaning

Sperry shoes come in many styles and materials. Knowing what your shoes are made from is the first step. This knowledge helps you decide on the best cleaning method. Different materials react differently to water and agitation. Treating them all the same can cause permanent damage.

Many classic Sperry styles feature durable canvas. This material is often found in their popular boat shoes. Canvas is a fabric, similar to denim or cotton. It can usually withstand machine washing, but with specific precautions. Canvas tolerates water well. It also stands up to gentle detergents.

Other Sperry shoes use leather. This can be full-grain, nubuck, or patent leather. Leather is a natural material. It can shrink, crack, or lose its shape when exposed to too much water or heat. Suede is another common material. It is a type of leather with a soft, napped finish. Suede is very sensitive to water and can stain easily.

Before you clean, check your shoe's tag or the manufacturer's website. This provides specific care instructions for your model. If your Sperrys have mixed materials, like canvas with leather accents, always defer to the most delicate material. This ensures you do not damage any part of the shoe.

## The General Rule: Should You Machine Wash Sperry Shoes?

Many people want to know if they can machine wash Sperry shoes. The short answer depends on the material. For most canvas Sperry shoes, machine washing is an option. It can be an effective way to remove dirt and odors. However, it requires careful steps to protect the shoes.

Never machine wash Sperry shoes made of leather or suede. These materials are too delicate for the washing machine. Leather can become stiff, crack, or lose its natural oils. Suede can get matted, discolored, or permanently damaged. Hand cleaning is always the safest method for these types of shoes. We have dedicated guides if you need to know [can you machine wash leather shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-machine-wash-leather-shoes) or [can I machine wash suede shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-machine-wash-suede-shoes).

For canvas shoes, machine washing offers convenience. It can save time compared to hand scrubbing. It also helps in reaching all areas of the shoe. The key is to use the right settings and protection. This prevents the shoes from being tossed around too much. It also protects your washing machine from damage.

Always consider the age and condition of your shoes. Very old or fragile shoes might not hold up well in a machine. Hand cleaning might be a better choice for them. If you are unsure, err on the side of caution. A gentle hand wash is usually safer than a machine wash.

## Preparing Sperry Canvas Shoes for the Washing Machine

Proper preparation makes a big difference when you machine wash Sperry shoes. This step protects both your shoes and your washing machine. Take your time to get everything ready. It helps ensure a successful cleaning process.

First, remove the shoelaces. Laces can get tangled in the washing machine. They can also get caught in the agitator. You can hand wash laces separately with a little soap. Or, you can place them in a small mesh bag with the shoes.

Next, remove any removable insoles. Insoles often hold a lot of moisture and odor. They might also break down in the machine. Cleaning them separately allows them to dry fully. This also helps reduce any lingering smells. You can scrub insoles by hand with a brush and mild soap. Let them air dry completely before putting them back in the shoes.

Scrape off any large pieces of dirt or mud. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush for this. You can also tap the shoes together to loosen debris. This prevents dirt from clogging your washing machine. It also helps the detergent work better on the remaining grime.

Finally, place your Sperry shoes in a mesh laundry bag. This bag protects the shoes from banging around inside the machine. It also protects the machine drum from impact. If you do not have a mesh bag, an old pillowcase tied shut will work. This preparation step is crucial for any shoes you want to clean in a washing machine.

## A Step-by-Step Guide: How to Machine Wash Canvas Sperry Shoes

Once your canvas Sperry shoes are prepped, it is time for the wash cycle. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a safe and effective clean. Using the correct settings is vital for preserving your shoes. I recommend treating them gently.

First, load your washing machine. Place the mesh laundry bag containing your Sperry shoes inside. For balance, add a few old towels to the load. This helps cushion the shoes. It prevents them from hitting against the machine walls. The towels also absorb some of the impact.

Next, add your detergent. Choose a mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, or powder detergents. Powder detergents might not dissolve completely. They can leave residue on your shoes. Use a small amount, roughly half of what you would use for a regular load of laundry. Too much soap is hard to rinse out.

Set your washing machine to the correct cycle. Always select a "delicate" or "gentle" cycle. The water temperature should be "cold." Hot water can shrink or damage the canvas. It can also cause colors to bleed. The spin cycle should also be set to "low." This minimizes agitation. You can learn more about [which washing machine mode for shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/which-washing-machine-mode-for-shoes) in our other guides.

Start the wash cycle. Once it finishes, immediately remove your shoes. Do not leave them sitting in the machine. Prompt removal helps prevent mildew or mold growth. Inspect your shoes for cleanliness. If they are not clean enough, you can repeat the process. Always air dry your shoes afterward.

## Handling Leather and Suede Sperry Shoes: A Different Approach

Leather and suede Sperry shoes need special care. You should never machine wash these materials. Machine washing can cause irreversible damage. The strong agitation, water, and heat of a machine are too harsh. They can ruin the texture and shape of the leather or suede.

For leather Sperry shoes, hand cleaning is the best method. Start by wiping off loose dirt with a soft, dry cloth. Mix a small amount of mild soap, like saddle soap or a leather cleaner, with water. Dampen a cloth with this solution. Gently wipe down the leather in small sections. Avoid soaking the leather. Once clean, wipe with a damp cloth to remove any soap residue. Then, dry with a clean, dry cloth. You can find more specific methods on how to wash shoes without a washing machine. Using a leather conditioner after cleaning helps restore moisture. It keeps the leather supple and prevents cracking.

Suede shoes are even more delicate. A stiff brush specifically for suede works well to remove dirt and scuffs. Brush in one direction to lift the nap. For stains, use a suede eraser or a small amount of white vinegar on a cloth. Blot the stain gently. Never rub vigorously. Let the suede air dry completely. Then, brush it again to restore the texture. Water can leave permanent marks on suede. Therefore, be very careful with liquid. Protecting your suede shoes with a waterproofing spray can also help.

Remember, the goal is to clean these materials gently. You want to preserve their look and feel. Machine washing will only lead to disappointment.

## Drying Your Sperry Shoes After Washing: Essential Steps

Drying your Sperry shoes correctly is just as important as washing them. Incorrect drying can shrink shoes. It can also cause damage to the materials. Always air dry your Sperry shoes, regardless of whether they were machine washed or hand washed.

Never put your Sperry shoes in a machine dryer. The high heat from a dryer can cause many problems. It can shrink canvas. It can crack or warp leather components. The rubber soles might also melt or deform. Direct heat can also loosen the glues that hold the shoes together. This shortens the lifespan of your footwear.

Find a cool, dry place with good airflow for drying. An outdoor shaded area works well on a warm day. Inside, near an open window is also good. Avoid direct sunlight, especially for colored shoes. Sunlight can fade colors. It can also make materials brittle over time.

To help shoes dry faster and maintain their shape, stuff them with paper. Use clean newspaper or paper towels. This absorbs moisture from inside the shoe. It also helps prevent the shoes from collapsing as they dry. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp.

Allow plenty of time for your shoes to dry completely. This can take 24 to 48 hours. Make sure they are totally dry before wearing them or storing them. Wearing damp shoes can lead to foot odor. It can also encourage mildew growth inside the shoe. If your shoes still smell after drying, read our tips on [how to wash smelly shoes in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-smelly-shoes-in-washing-machine) for preventative measures. Patience is key for proper drying.

## Maintaining Your Sperry Shoes: Tips for Longevity

Proper maintenance extends the life of your Sperry shoes. Cleaning is only one part of caring for your footwear. Regular habits help keep them looking good and feeling comfortable. I find that a little effort goes a long way.

Brush off dirt regularly. After each wear, take a moment to brush off any loose dirt. A soft brush or damp cloth works well. This prevents grime from building up and setting into the material. Regular brushing reduces the need for deep cleaning.

Rotate your shoes. Do not wear the same pair of Sperrys every single day. Give them a day or two to air out between wears. This allows moisture to evaporate. It also helps the materials recover their shape. Rotating shoes also reduces wear and tear on any single pair.

Store shoes properly. Keep your Sperry shoes in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. Shoe trees are useful for maintaining shape. They also absorb moisture from inside the shoe. If storing for a long time, use shoe bags to protect them from dust. Explore our general advice on [how to keep shoes clean](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-keep-shoes-clean) for a broader perspective on shoe care.

Address stains quickly. The sooner you treat a stain, the easier it is to remove. Different materials need different stain removal methods. Research the best approach for canvas, leather, or suede. Always test any cleaner on an inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not damage the material.

Protect your shoes. Consider using a protective spray designed for your shoe material. Water-resistant sprays can help repel water and stains from canvas and suede. For leather, a good conditioner helps protect against drying and cracking. These small steps make a big difference in how long your Sperrys last.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Sperry Shoes

Cleaning your Sperry shoes can go wrong if you are not careful. Many common mistakes can damage your favorite footwear. Avoiding these pitfalls ensures your shoes stay in good condition. I want you to get the best results.

One major mistake is using hot water. Hot water can shrink canvas. It can also set stains permanently. For leather, hot water can cause drying and cracking. Always use cold water when washing Sperry shoes. This is true whether you machine wash or hand wash.

Another error is using harsh detergents or bleach. Bleach can strip colors from canvas shoes. It can also weaken the fabric. Strong detergents can be too abrasive. They can leave residue that attracts more dirt. Stick to mild, gentle detergents. If you want to know how to bleach shoes, check out our guide on [how to bleach shoes in washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-bleach-shoes-in-washing-machine), but do so with caution and only for appropriate materials.

Putting shoes in the machine dryer is a big no-no. As mentioned earlier, high heat is destructive. It can warp soles. It can shrink materials. It can also melt glues. Always air dry your Sperry shoes. Patience is key here.

Not removing laces and insoles is another mistake. Laces can tangle. Insoles can retain moisture and odors if left inside. Taking them out allows for a more thorough clean. It also ensures everything dries properly.

Over-scrubbing delicate areas, especially on leather or suede, can cause damage. Suede can get matted. Leather can get scratched. Use gentle motions and appropriate brushes for each material. Being too rough will wear down the material. Following these simple rules helps keep your Sperrys looking great.
