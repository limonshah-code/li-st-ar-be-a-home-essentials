## How To Change Air Conditioner Filter In House

Keeping your home comfortable means paying attention to your air conditioner. An important, yet often overlooked, task is changing your AC filter. I know it seems small, but this simple step has a big impact. Today, I will show you exactly how to change an air conditioner filter in your house. We will cover why it matters, what filter to choose, and a clear step-by-step process. You will soon have cleaner air and a more efficient cooling system.

### Takeaway

Changing your home's AC filter is simple and vital.
*   Find the right filter size and MERV rating for your system.
*   Turn off your AC unit before working on it for safety.
*   Note the airflow arrow on the new filter for correct installation.
*   Replace your filter regularly to ensure good air quality and system efficiency.

Changing your air conditioner filter in your house involves turning off the unit, locating the filter slot, noting the airflow direction, removing the old filter, and inserting a new one with the arrow pointing towards the furnace or air handler. This simple task keeps your system working well and your indoor air clean.

### Why Replacing Your AC Filter Matters for Your Home

I used to think changing an AC filter was just a small chore. Then I learned how much it affects my home. A clean filter is vital for healthy indoor air and an efficient air conditioning system. When a filter gets dirty, it works harder. This makes your AC less effective and can even lead to costly repairs.

#### Better Air Quality

A clean air conditioner filter acts as a guard for your home. It traps dust, pollen, pet dander, and other tiny particles. These things float in your air. When your filter is clean, it catches them before you breathe them in. This helps people with allergies or asthma feel better. It also makes your home feel fresher.

A dirty filter cannot do this job well. It lets these particles pass through. They then circulate throughout your home. This lowers your indoor air quality. I always notice a difference in air freshness after a filter change.

#### System Efficiency

Your AC unit needs to breathe freely to work its best. A clean filter allows air to flow easily through the system. This means your AC does not have to work as hard to cool your home. It uses less energy.

When a filter is clogged, the AC motor struggles. It pulls more power. This leads to higher energy bills each month. I have seen my own energy use drop after making sure my filter is clean. This simple step keeps my cooling costs down.

#### Saving Money

Beyond lower energy bills, changing your filter saves you money long-term. A stressed AC system wears out faster. A dirty filter can cause parts to overheat. It can lead to coil freeze-ups. These issues require expensive professional repairs.

Regular filter changes extend the life of your AC unit. This means you do not have to replace your whole system as often. I consider it a small investment that protects a much larger one.

### Finding the Right AC Filter for Your Home

Choosing the correct AC filter might seem tricky at first. There are different sizes and types. But once you know what to look for, it is quite simple. The right filter ensures your system runs well. It also provides the best air quality for your living space.

#### Understanding Filter Sizes

The size of your filter is very important. It must fit perfectly into the filter slot. If it is too small, air will go around it, bringing in dirt. If it is too big, it will not fit at all. You can find the size printed on the side of your old filter. It usually shows three numbers, like 20x25x1. These numbers mean length, width, and thickness in inches.

Always double-check these numbers before buying a new filter. I take a picture of the old filter's label with my phone. This way, I always have the exact dimensions with me. It prevents buying the wrong size.

#### MERV Ratings Explained

MERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value. This rating tells you how well a filter can capture tiny particles. MERV ratings usually range from 1 to 20. Higher MERV numbers mean the filter catches smaller particles. A MERV 8 filter is good for most homes. It balances air cleaning with air flow.

If you have allergies or pets, you might consider a MERV 11 or 13 filter. Be aware that very high MERV filters (above 13) can restrict airflow. This can strain some older AC systems. Check your AC unit's manual to see what MERV rating it supports. I generally stick to MERV 8 or 11 for my home.

#### Types of Filters

There are several types of AC filters.
*   **Fiberglass Filters:** These are the cheapest and most common. They offer basic filtration, catching larger dust particles. I find these okay for general use but not great for air quality.
*   **Pleated Filters:** These filters have more surface area. They catch smaller particles like pollen and pet dander. They have higher MERV ratings. I prefer these for their better performance.
*   **Washable Filters:** Some filters are designed to be cleaned and reused. They require regular washing. While they save on replacement costs, I often find them less effective than good pleated filters. You can learn more about how to [clean air conditioner filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-air-conditioner-filter) or specifically [can you clean an air conditioner filter with water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-clean-an-air-conditioner-filter-with-water) if you have one of these.
*   **Electrostatic Filters:** These use static electricity to attract particles. Some are disposable, others washable. They offer good filtration without high airflow restriction.

Choosing the right type depends on your needs and budget. I always go for pleated filters for a good balance of cost and performance.

### Tools and Materials Needed for AC Filter Replacement

Changing your AC filter is a simple task that does not need many tools. You probably have most of what you need around your house already. Gathering these items before you start makes the process smoother. I always make sure I have everything ready before I begin. This saves time and frustration.

Here is a simple list of what you will need:

*   **New AC Filter:** This is the most important item. Make sure it is the correct size and MERV rating for your unit. I mentioned checking the old filter for size, and I cannot stress enough how important this step is. Having the right filter ensures proper function and avoids issues.
*   **Marker or Pen:** Useful for writing the date on your new filter. This helps you remember when you changed it last. I find this simple trick very helpful for keeping track of my maintenance schedule.
*   **Dust Rag or Vacuum Cleaner:** You will likely find dust and debris around the filter slot. A quick wipe or vacuum keeps your unit clean. I use a small handheld vacuum to get into tight spots. This helps prevent dust from entering the system when you remove the old filter.
*   **Flashlight (Optional but Recommended):** Some filter slots are in dark areas, like a basement or attic. A flashlight helps you see clearly. I always keep one handy just in case, even during the day. It ensures I see the airflow arrow correctly.

That's it! You do not need any special tools like wrenches or screwdrivers. This job is truly designed for any homeowner to do. Being prepared makes the whole process quick and easy.

### Step-by-Step Guide: How to Change Your Air Conditioner Filter

Changing your AC filter is a quick and simple maintenance task. You do not need to be a skilled technician to do it. Just follow these steps, and you will have a fresh filter in place in minutes. I do this regularly, and it feels good to know I am maintaining my home's air quality myself.

#### 1. Turn Off Your AC Unit

Safety comes first. Before doing any work on your AC system, turn off the power. Go to your thermostat and switch the system to "Off." If your unit is outside, or if you want to be extra safe, find the circuit breaker that controls your AC or furnace. Flip it to the "Off" position. This prevents the unit from accidentally turning on while you are working. I always make sure the power is off; it gives me peace of mind.

#### 2. Locate the Filter Slot

Your AC filter is typically found in one of two places:
*   **At the air handler or furnace:** This is common for central AC systems. Look for a slot on the side, bottom, or top of the large indoor unit. It often has a small door or cover that slides open.
*   **In a return air vent:** Some homes have the filter located in a large return air vent on a wall or ceiling. This vent will have a grille that unlatches or unscrews.

Once you find it, you will see the old, dirty filter inside. I usually find mine right where the large return air duct meets the furnace.

#### 3. Note the Airflow Direction

Before you pull out the old filter, look at it closely. You will see an arrow printed on the filter's frame. This arrow shows the direction of airflow. It is crucial to remember this direction. The arrow always points towards the furnace or air handler, meaning it points in the direction the air flows *into* the unit. I always make a mental note or take a quick photo.

#### 4. Remove the Old Filter

Carefully slide or pull out the old filter from its slot. It will likely be covered in dust, dirt, and pet hair. This is normal and means it was doing its job. Try to keep the dirt contained as you remove it. Have a trash bag ready nearby to put the dirty filter straight into. I try to pull it out smoothly to avoid releasing a dust cloud into the room.

#### 5. Insert the New Filter

Now, take your new, clean filter. Make sure the airflow arrow on the new filter points in the same direction as the old one. The arrow should point towards the furnace or air handler. Slide the new filter into the slot. Make sure it fits snugly. There should be no gaps around the edges where air could sneak past.

After the new filter is in place, close the filter slot or reattach the vent grille. Then, go back to your thermostat or circuit breaker and turn your AC system back on. You have just completed a vital home maintenance task! It is a simple job, but it makes a big difference.

### How Often Should You Change Your House AC Filter?

One common question I get is "How often should I change my AC filter?" There is no single answer for everyone. The frequency depends on several things. However, replacing it regularly is essential for efficiency and air quality. I follow general guidelines but also adjust based on my home's specific conditions.

#### General Guidelines

As a general rule, most manufacturers recommend changing your AC filter every **90 days**, or every three months. For me, this is a good baseline. It ensures my system is always pulling clean air. Many people simply change it at the start of each new season. This makes it easy to remember.

If you have a basic fiberglass filter (MERV 1-4), I might change it every 30 days. These filters catch less and get clogged faster. Higher-quality pleated filters (MERV 8-13) often last up to 3 months. Always check your filter monthly, regardless of the guideline. It takes just a minute to see its condition.

#### Factors Affecting Frequency

Several factors can make your filter get dirty faster. If any of these apply to your home, you will need to change your filter more often.
*   **Pets:** I have a dog, and I know pet hair and dander clog filters quickly. If you have furry friends, change your filter every 60 days, or even every 30 days if you have multiple pets.
*   **Allergies or Asthma:** If anyone in your home has allergies or asthma, I recommend changing the filter more frequently. A cleaner filter means fewer airborne allergens. Changing it every 30-45 days can make a big difference in comfort.
*   **High Dust Levels:** Do you live near a dirt road? Is there construction happening nearby? If your home experiences a lot of dust, your filter will trap more particles faster. Consider monthly changes in these situations.
*   **Occupancy:** More people living in the house generally means more dust and skin cells. A busy home might need more frequent filter changes.
*   **Renovations:** If you are doing any home renovations, dust levels will be extremely high. Change your filter immediately after any dusty work. I often put a cheaper filter in during dusty projects and switch to my regular filter once the dust settles.
*   **Filter Type:** As I mentioned, cheaper fiberglass filters need more frequent changes. Higher MERV filters can sometimes last longer, but always check them.

I have found that checking my filter monthly is the best habit. If it looks very dirty, I change it right away. It is better to change it too often than not often enough.

### Common Issues and Tips for AC Filter Maintenance

Even with regular changes, you might encounter some common issues. Knowing what to look for and how to respond helps maintain your system. I have learned a few things over time that make filter maintenance easier and more effective. It is not just about changing the filter; it is about understanding its role.

#### What if Your AC Says "Clean Filter"?

Some modern AC units or smart thermostats have a "clean filter" light or message. This is a helpful reminder. When I see this light, I know it is definitely time for a filter change. This indicator is usually based on run time, not actual dirt levels. So, even if the filter looks okay, it is a good idea to swap it out.

If your LG air conditioner specifically says "clean filter," it is telling you the same thing. You can learn more about [why your LG air conditioner says clean filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-air-conditioner-says-clean-filter) and how to reset the indicator. Following these prompts keeps your system running well. It prevents buildup that could lead to bigger problems.

#### When to Consider Professional Help

While changing your filter is a DIY task, sometimes other issues arise. If your AC is running but not cooling, or if it makes strange noises, it might be more than just a filter problem. A clogged filter can contribute to cooling issues. However, if a new filter does not fix the problem, you might need a professional. For example, if your [central air conditioner is running but not cooling the house](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-central-air-conditioner-running-but-not-cooling-the-house), it could be a more complex issue.

Also, if you notice standing water near your indoor unit, or a persistent musty smell, these are signs of larger problems. Do not try to fix these yourself unless you are trained. A professional HVAC technician can diagnose and repair these issues safely. They can also check the overall health of your system.

#### Do Not Clean Disposable Filters

It is important to remember that most AC filters are disposable. They are made to be used once and then thrown away. I have heard people try to vacuum or wash disposable filters to save money. This does not work well. It can damage the filter material. It can make it less effective at trapping particles.

Only clean filters specifically marked as "washable." If your filter is disposable, get a new one. Trying to clean a disposable filter can push dust deeper into the material or even release it into your home's air. For those with washable filters, understanding how to clean them is key, and some models like a Mitsubishi electric filter might have specific cleaning instructions. You can learn about how to [clean a Mitsubishi electric air conditioner filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mitsubishi-electric-air-conditioner-filter) or how to [clean a filter on an LG air conditioner dual inverter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-filter-on-lg-air-conditioner-dual-inverter) for specific models.

### FAQ Section

**Q: How often should I change my air conditioner filter?**
A: Most experts recommend changing your AC filter every 90 days. However, factors like pets, allergies, high dust levels, or ongoing renovations can require more frequent changes. Check your filter monthly. If it looks dirty, change it.

**Q: What happens if I do not change my AC filter?**
A: Not changing your AC filter leads to several problems. Dirty filters restrict airflow, making your AC unit work harder and use more energy. This increases your utility bills.
