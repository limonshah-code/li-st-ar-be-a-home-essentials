## Reupholstering a Recliner Chair: Your DIY Guide

Do you have a beloved recliner chair that has seen better days? Its fabric might be worn, faded, or simply out of style. Instead of replacing it, you can **reupholster a recliner chair** yourself. This project gives your favorite seat a fresh new life. It also allows you to customize its look to perfectly match your home decor.

In this comprehensive guide, I will walk you through every step of the process. We will cover choosing the right materials, gathering your tools, and meticulously disassembling and reassembling your chair. By the end, you will have a beautiful, revitalized recliner and the satisfaction of a successful DIY project. Let's transform your old recliner into a stunning piece once more!

### Takeaway

Reupholstering a recliner chair is a rewarding DIY project. It brings new life to an old favorite.
*   Prepare correctly by gathering all necessary tools and fabric.
*   Carefully disassemble the chair, documenting each step.
*   Use the old fabric pieces as patterns for cutting your new material.
*   Attach new fabric section by section, ensuring a snug fit.
*   Reassemble the recliner, taking your time for a professional finish.

To reupholster a recliner chair, you carefully remove its old fabric, use those pieces as patterns for new material, then meticulously attach the new fabric to each section of the chair's frame before reassembling it. This process updates the chair's appearance and comfort significantly.

## Is Reupholstering Your Recliner a Smart Move?

Deciding whether to reupholster your recliner chair is a big question. Many factors play a role in this choice. Often, the frame of an older recliner is built with stronger, more durable materials than newer chairs. Giving it a new cover can be a very sensible decision. This means you are investing in quality that already exists.

Reupholstering offers a fantastic way to update your home without buying new furniture. It lets you customize the fabric, pattern, and color. You can make the chair fit your current style perfectly. This approach is also an eco-friendly option, as it prevents a perfectly good chair from ending up in a landfill. It contributes to sustainable living by giving items a second life.

Consider the emotional value of your recliner. Perhaps it is a family heirloom or holds sentimental memories. Reupholstering preserves its history while making it functional and beautiful again. While it requires time and effort, the result is a unique piece tailored to your taste. You will save money compared to purchasing a high-quality new recliner. This makes reupholstering a recliner chair a cost-effective choice in many situations. It is a smart move for your wallet and your home.

## Essential Tools and Materials for Recliner Upholstery

Starting any DIY project requires proper preparation, and reupholstering a recliner chair is no exception. Having the right tools and materials on hand will make the process smoother and more efficient. I like to gather everything before I even begin disassembling the chair. This prevents frustrating stops and starts.

First, you need to choose your fabric. Recliner fabric should be durable and resistant to wear, such as heavy-duty cotton, linen, microfiber, or even leather for a luxurious feel. Measure your recliner carefully to estimate the fabric yardage needed. You can check out our guide on [how to measure a recliner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-measure-a-recliner) for precise instructions. Also, consider replacing the foam padding or batting if your chair feels saggy. High-density foam offers better support and lasts longer.

Here is a list of essential tools and materials you will need:

*   **Fabric:** Choose a durable upholstery fabric in your desired color and pattern.
*   **New Foam/Batting:** If replacing existing padding, select appropriate density and thickness.
*   **Staple Gun:** An electric or pneumatic staple gun works best for upholstery.
*   **Upholstery Staples:** Ensure these are appropriate for your staple gun and fabric thickness.
*   **Staple Remover/Flathead Screwdriver:** Essential for taking off old staples.
*   **Pliers:** Helpful for pulling out stubborn staples or nails.
*   **Sewing Machine:** A heavy-duty machine is best for thick upholstery fabric.
*   **Upholstery Thread:** Strong thread that matches your fabric color.
*   **Scissors:** Sharp fabric scissors are a must for clean cuts.
*   **Measuring Tape:** For accurate measurements of fabric pieces.
*   **Fabric Chalk/Marker:** For marking patterns on your new fabric.
*   **Webbing Stretcher (Optional):** If replacing old webbing, this tool helps stretch it tight.
*   **Goggles and Gloves:** For safety during disassembly and stapling.
*   **Camera/Smartphone:** To take reference photos during disassembly.

Having these items ready will prepare you for a successful recliner reupholstery project. It makes the entire process more enjoyable and less stressful. With the right supplies, you are ready for the next step.

## Disassembling Your Recliner: The First Step

Disassembling your recliner chair is a critical phase of the reupholstery process. It helps you understand how the chair is put together and provides patterns for your new fabric. I always start by taking lots of photos or videos. This visual record will be invaluable when you put the chair back together. Pay close attention to how each piece of fabric is attached. Note the order of its removal.

Begin by flipping the recliner over to access the underside. You will usually find a dust cover stapled to the bottom. Carefully remove this cover. Then, you can see the chair's internal mechanisms and springs. Next, start removing the fabric, working from the bottom up. Fabric panels are typically stapled or tacked to the wooden frame. Use your staple remover or a flathead screwdriver and pliers to pry out each staple. Try not to tear the old fabric more than necessary. These pieces will serve as your patterns.

As you remove each fabric section, label it clearly (e.g., "right arm," "back cushion front," "footrest top"). I like to label both the fabric piece and the corresponding part of the chair's frame. Some recliners might have a separate back that detaches. If so, carefully remove it. You might need to detach the footrest and armrests as well. Be mindful of any wires, springs, or reclining mechanisms. You might need to access and fix parts of the frame or mechanism, such as learning [how to fix a recliner chair back](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-a-recliner-chair-back) if you notice any issues during disassembly. Keep all screws and small parts in labeled bags. This prevents losing them and simplifies reassembly later on. This careful disassembly is the foundation for a professional-looking finish.

### Removing Different Sections of Fabric

Removing the fabric from each section requires a thoughtful approach. Each part of the recliner has unique challenges. For example, the back of the chair often has a lot of tension. The arms might have multiple layers or piping. The footrest usually has several small fabric pieces.

*   **Seat and Back:** Start by releasing tension on the fabric from the bottom or back. Work your way around, removing staples or tacks. Ensure you keep the fabric intact as much as possible. These larger pieces are crucial for accurate new patterns.
*   **Armrests:** These often involve curved sections and tighter stapling. Take your time to gently peel back the fabric. Look for any hidden screws or attachments holding padding in place. Some armrests might also have piping along the edges, which requires careful removal if you plan to reuse it or make new.
*   **Footrest:** The footrest usually has fabric on both the top and underside. It might also wrap around the edges. Note how the fabric is folded and secured on the corners. This detail is important for a neat finish later.
*   **Cushions and Padding:** If your recliner has removable cushions, simply take off their covers. If the padding is integrated, you will remove the fabric covering it. Inspect the foam and batting. Decide if it needs replacement for better comfort.

This methodical approach to disassembly ensures you gain all the necessary information. It prepares you for the next step of creating new fabric pieces. Remember, the goal is to carefully deconstruct so you can perfectly reconstruct.

## Cutting and Preparing Your New Fabric Pieces

Once your recliner is disassembled and all the old fabric pieces are removed, you are ready for the exciting part: preparing your new fabric. This step is where your vision truly starts to take shape. I find it very satisfying to see the new fabric laid out. Accuracy here is crucial for a professional finish.

Lay your new upholstery fabric flat on a large, clean surface. Ironing the fabric beforehand helps remove wrinkles and ensures a smooth pattern transfer. Take each old fabric piece and place it on the new fabric. Arrange them to make the most efficient use of your material, paying attention to the fabric's grain and any patterns. Make sure stripes or patterns align correctly across different chair sections if that is your design choice. For example, if you are working with [how to reupholster a chair with piping](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reupholster-a-chair-with-piping), ensure you account for the piping in your cuts.

Trace around each old fabric piece onto your new material using fabric chalk or a marker. Add a seam allowance of about 1/2 to 1 inch around all edges, depending on how the original fabric was attached. This extra material gives you room to pull and staple the fabric taut. If you are replacing any piping, you will also need to cut fabric strips for the new piping cord. Carefully cut out all your new fabric pieces with sharp fabric scissors. Label each new piece immediately with its corresponding chair part. This prevents confusion during assembly. Double-check your cuts against the old pieces to ensure accuracy before you start attaching them. Precision in this stage saves a lot of headaches later on.

## Reupholstering Each Section: A Step-by-Step Guide

With your new fabric pieces cut and ready, it's time to begin attaching them to your recliner's frame. This is where the magic happens, turning your old chair into a revitalized piece. I like to work systematically, typically from the inside out, or following the reverse order of disassembly. This ensures all edges are neatly tucked and secured.

Start with the inner sections of the chair, such as the seat and inner armrests. Place the new fabric piece over the corresponding section, aligning it carefully. Begin by stapling the fabric in the center of one edge, then move outwards, alternating sides. This technique helps you stretch the fabric evenly and avoid wrinkles. Pull the fabric taut as you staple, but do not pull too hard, or it may distort the pattern. Use plenty of staples for a secure hold, placing them about 1/2 inch apart. Trim any excess fabric after stapling, leaving just enough to create a clean edge.

Once the inner parts are done, move to the outer sections like the back and outer armrests. Pay extra attention to corners and curves. You may need to make small cuts or pleats in the fabric to get a smooth finish. If your recliner has piping, you will sew this piping onto the edges of the fabric pieces before attaching them to the chair. Attach the fabric to the footrest last, being careful to cover all edges neatly. Always refer to your photographs from the disassembly stage. They show how the original fabric was attached and folded. Take your time, and do not rush. Each section contributes to the overall look and feel of your newly reupholstered recliner.

### Tips for a Smooth Finish

Achieving a professional-looking finish requires patience and attention to detail. These small tips can make a big difference in the final outcome. I always remind myself to go slowly and check my work often. A smooth finish means comfortable and attractive furniture.

*   **Stretch Evenly:** When stapling, always pull the fabric with consistent tension. Uneven stretching can lead to ripples or sagging. Work from the middle of a section outwards to both sides.
*   **Trim Excess:** After securing an edge with staples, trim any excess fabric closely but carefully. Too much fabric can create bulk, while too little might unravel.
*   **Corners and Curves:** For tight corners, make relief cuts in the fabric. This allows it to lie flat without bunching. For curves, use more staples and smaller pleats on the underside to mold the fabric smoothly.
*   **Piping Integration:** If adding new piping, ensure it is sewn securely into the seam line of your fabric pieces. This gives a crisp, defined edge. [How to reupholster a chair with piping](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reupholster-a-chair-with-piping) provides detailed guidance on this technique.
*   **Inspect Regularly:** Step back frequently to check your work. Look for any loose spots, wrinkles, or unevenness. It's easier to correct these issues early on than after the entire section is stapled.

These techniques ensure that your reupholstered recliner not only looks great but also feels comfortable and durable. A well-finished piece showcases your dedication and skill.

## Reassembling Your Recliner and Final Touches

After all the new fabric is meticulously stapled onto each component, it's time for the final, rewarding stage: reassembling your recliner chair. This step brings all your hard work together into a functional piece of furniture. I always look forward to this part, as the chair truly comes back to life. Refer to your photos and notes from disassembly to guide you through the process.

Start by reattaching the main components that you removed. This typically includes the back, armrests, and footrest. Make sure all screws and bolts are tightened securely. You do not want any wobbly parts on your newly upholstered chair. Pay close attention to the reclining mechanism. Ensure all levers and springs connect properly. You might find some helpful information on [how to fix a recliner footrest](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-a-recliner-footrest) if you encounter any issues with that specific part during reassembly. Test the reclining function several times to confirm everything operates smoothly.

Once the chair is structurally sound, you can add the finishing touches. This involves reattaching the dust cover to the bottom of the chair. It provides a clean look and protects the internal mechanisms. Trim any loose threads or uneven fabric edges for a neat appearance. Give the entire chair a final wipe-down to remove any chalk marks or dust. If you want to further protect your new fabric, you could consider making custom covers.

You have successfully reupholstered a recliner chair, giving it a beautiful second life.
