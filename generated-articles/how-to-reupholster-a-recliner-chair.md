Reupholstering a recliner chair involves removing old fabric, creating new patterns from the old pieces, cutting fresh fabric, and attaching it to the chair frame. This process requires patience, proper tools, and attention to detail to restore the chair's appearance and comfort.

### Getting Ready: Planning and Supplies for Your Recliner

Starting a recliner reupholstery project needs good preparation. You must plan carefully. The right planning saves time and prevents problems later. First, think about the fabric. Recliners get a lot of use. So, you need a durable fabric. Choose something that can handle wear and tear. Options include heavy-duty cotton, linen blends, or synthetic microfibers. These materials resist stains and fading. Consider the chair's style and your room's decor. Pick a color and pattern that complements your home. If you have pets or kids, look for performance fabrics.

Next, gather your tools. You will need several items for this job. An essential tool is an upholstery staple gun. A heavy-duty electric or pneumatic model works best. You will also need a staple remover or flathead screwdriver. These help take out old staples. A pair of sharp fabric scissors is a must. A sewing machine is necessary for stitching new fabric pieces. Other useful tools include a measuring tape, chalk or fabric marker, and a seam ripper. You might also need new foam or batting. This updates the chair's comfort. Check your recliner's current padding. Decide if it needs replacement. Investing in good tools makes the job easier and more fun.

Before you begin, create a dedicated workspace. This area should be clean and well-lit. Make sure you have enough room to move around the recliner. Also, store all your tools and fabric. A clean space helps you stay organized. It also prevents losing small parts. Proper planning makes the reupholstering process smoother. You are ready to start transforming your recliner once you have everything in place.

### Disassembly: Taking Your Recliner Apart Carefully

Disassembling your recliner is the first big step. It requires patience and care. Do not rush this part of the process. Your goal is to remove the old fabric while keeping it in good condition. The old fabric will serve as your pattern. Start by removing any removable cushions. Take clear photos of how each piece of fabric is attached. This documentation is very helpful for reassembly. Pay attention to seams, zippers, and piping. Note how the fabric wraps around corners and edges.

Begin removing staples or screws holding the fabric. Use a staple remover or a flathead screwdriver. Work slowly and methodically. Many recliners have hidden screws or clips. You may need to tilt the chair to find these. Some parts of the chair may be difficult to reach. A long-nosed staple remover can help here. As you remove each piece of fabric, label it. Write down where it came from. For example, "back cushion front," "armrest inside," or "footrest top." This labeling ensures you can put everything back correctly.

Keep all hardware in a small container. Screws, bolts, and washers are easy to lose. This includes any springs or clips. Sometimes, recliner mechanisms are complex. You might need to detach certain sections. This gives you better access to the frame. For instance, the footrest often separates from the main chair. If you need to fix a sag in the seat, this is a good time to inspect springs or webbing. You can find out [how to fix sagging recliner seat](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-sagging-recliner-seat) if your chair has this issue. This step makes replacing foam or springs much simpler. Take your time with this disassembly. A careful disassembly leads to a successful reupholstery.

### Pattern Creation: Crafting Your New Fabric Pieces

After removing all the old fabric, you are ready to create your new patterns. This step is critical for a well-fitted finish. The old fabric pieces are your best templates. Lay each old fabric piece flat. Smooth out any wrinkles or creases. If a piece is torn, try to tape it together. This helps maintain its original shape. You want the new pieces to match the old ones exactly.

Place the old fabric piece onto your new upholstery fabric. Make sure the new fabric is also flat. Pay attention to the fabric grain. Most fabrics have a direction. You want all your new pieces to run in the same direction. This ensures consistent look and feel. Use tailor's chalk or a fabric marker to trace around the old piece. Trace carefully and precisely. Add a seam allowance around all edges. Typically, a 1/2 inch or 5/8 inch seam allowance is standard. This extra fabric allows for stitching.

For pieces with curves or intricate shapes, take extra care. You might need to pin the old fabric to the new one. This prevents slipping while tracing. If you encounter a complex section, like a curved armrest or headrest, remember how the old fabric wrapped around it. Sometimes, you need to cut out multiple small pieces to cover one area. If your recliner has piping, you will also need to create new piping. This involves covering cording with fabric strips. This step is similar to [how to reupholster a chair with piping](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reupholster-a-chair-with-piping). Making new patterns accurately saves you from fitting problems later. Double-check all your measurements before cutting. A good pattern ensures your new upholstery fits like a glove.

### Cutting and Sewing: Preparing Your Upholstery Panels

Once you have all your patterns traced, it's time to cut your new fabric. Use sharp fabric scissors for clean edges. Dull scissors can fray the fabric or make uneven cuts. Cut each piece carefully along your traced lines. Remember to include the seam allowances you marked earlier. Take your time here. Accurate cuts make the sewing process easier. After cutting, you will have all the individual panels for your recliner.

Now, move to the sewing machine. Refer to your photos from the disassembly stage. These photos show how the original pieces were stitched together. Start by sewing the largest panels first. For example, the backrest, seat, and armrest sections. Use a strong thread suitable for upholstery. A polyester or nylon thread works well. Use a longer stitch length than you might for clothing. This creates durable seams. Straight stitches are common. Use an even seam allowance for all seams. This keeps your pieces aligned.

If your recliner had special features, sew those in now. This includes zippers for removable cushions. Also, attach any piping you made. Piping adds a neat, finished look to seams. You can learn more about this from general upholstery guides. For example, look at guides on [how to reupholster a tub chair](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reupholster-a-tub-chair). You may also need to sew loops or pockets for certain chair parts. Some recliners have fabric flaps that attach with velcro. Sew these elements in at this stage. Press your seams open or to one side. This makes the finished piece smoother. A well-sewn cover will look professional. It will also last a long time. Double-check all seams before moving to the next stage.

### Reassembly and Attaching New Fabric: Building Back Your Recliner

Now, you will begin putting your recliner back together with the new fabric. This is where your disassembly photos and labels become invaluable. Start with the innermost sections of the chair. This often means the seat base or the inside of the backrest. Drape the appropriate new fabric panel over the section. Align it carefully. Ensure it covers the area evenly.

Begin attaching the fabric using your upholstery staple gun. Start by stapling the fabric in the center of one edge. Then, pull the fabric taut and staple the opposite side. Work your way from the center outwards, stapling every few inches. This technique helps remove wrinkles and ensures a smooth finish. As you work, pull the fabric firmly but not so tightly that it distorts the shape of the foam or frame. When you reach corners, fold the fabric neatly. Create clean, crisp pleats or folds. This takes practice. Look at how the old fabric handled the corners.

Work section by section. Attach the seat fabric first, then the backrest, followed by the arms. If your recliner has a footrest, upholster it as a separate unit. Then attach it back to the chair frame. Be mindful of the recliner mechanism. Ensure no fabric impedes its movement. Cut any excess fabric, leaving about a half-inch margin past the staples. If your recliner includes wood trim, you might need to reattach fabric around it. This is similar to the process for [how to reupholster a chair with wood trim](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reupholster-a-chair-with-wood-trim). Some parts might require specialized techniques like blind stapling. This hides staples. Take your time to achieve a professional look.

### Padding and Cushion Replacement: Enhancing Comfort

While reupholstering your recliner, it's a good idea to assess its comfort. The padding and cushions often compress over time. Replacing them makes a big difference. This step ensures your newly upholstered recliner feels as good as it looks. First, inspect the existing foam cushions. Do they feel flat? Do they spring back when you press them? If not, consider replacing them. You can buy new foam in various densities. High-density foam lasts longer and offers more support.

Cut the new foam to the exact size and shape of the old cushions. Use an electric carving knife or a sharp utility knife for clean cuts. If the old foam is still in good shape, you might only need to add a layer of batting. Batting is a soft, fluffy material. It adds a plush feel. It also smooths out any bumps. Wrap the new foam or existing cushions with a layer or two of polyester batting. Secure the batting with spray adhesive or light stitching. This creates a softer, more rounded appearance.

For the backrest and armrests, you might find loose fill or thin foam layers. Replace these with fresh batting or foam. This brings back their original plumpness. This is also a good time to check the webbing or springs under the seat. If they are loose or broken, fix them now. You can use new webbing or spring clips to restore support. Proper padding enhances the seating experience. It also gives your recliner a more luxurious look. A well-padded recliner is a joy to sit in.

### Finishing Touches and Final Assembly: Completing Your Recliner Project

You are almost done with your recliner transformation. The finishing touches bring everything together. This part ensures your reupholstered recliner looks complete and professional. After attaching all the main fabric pieces, check for any loose edges. Trim away excess fabric. Ensure all staples are fully driven into the frame. If any staples stick out, tap them in with a hammer.

Reattach any decorative elements. This includes buttons, trim, or decorative nails. If your original recliner had a dust cover on the bottom, attach a new one. This piece of fabric covers the underside of the chair. It protects the inner workings from dust. Use a thin, non-woven fabric for this. Staple it neatly around the bottom edges of the frame. Ensure it is taut.

Finally, reassemble any parts you detached earlier. This might include the footrest mechanism or the back of the chair. Follow your disassembly photos for guidance. Test the recliner's functions. Make sure it reclines smoothly. Check that the footrest extends and retracts without issues. If you notice any sticking or stiffness, inspect the fabric near the moving parts. Sometimes, a small trim of fabric is all that is needed. This step allows you to ensure the chair functions as it should.

Take a moment to admire your work. You have successfully learned how to reupholster a recliner chair. This project brings new life to an old piece. It saves you money. It also gives you a unique, customized item. Enjoy the comfort and style of your newly transformed recliner.
