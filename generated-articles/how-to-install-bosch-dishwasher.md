### Preparing for Your Bosch Dishwasher Installation

Before you begin to install your new Bosch dishwasher, proper preparation is important. This step helps prevent issues and makes the process easier. First, check your kitchen space. Make sure the opening for the dishwasher fits your new unit's dimensions. Bosch dishwashers often come in standard sizes, but verifying is always wise. You need enough room not just for the appliance itself, but also for working around it.

Next, gather all the tools and parts you will need. This includes basic tools like screwdrivers, wrenches, and a level. You might also need a drill, pliers, and a tape measure. For plumbing connections, have Teflon tape or pipe thread sealant ready. Check if your new Bosch dishwasher came with all necessary installation hardware. Some models might require specific mounting brackets or power cords. Make sure you have a drip pan, as it protects your floor from potential leaks. A sturdy pair of gloves is also a good idea for protecting your hands during the installation.

Safety is the most important part of this initial phase. Locate your home's main water shut-off valve. You will need to turn off the water supply to the kitchen area. Find your electrical circuit breaker panel. Turn off the power to the kitchen circuit where the dishwasher will connect. This prevents electric shock during the installation process. Always double-check that both water and power are off before touching any lines or wires. If you are unsure about electrical work, consider hiring a professional.

Think about how your new dishwasher will fit with your existing countertops. For instance, if you have [granite countertops, specific installation steps might be needed](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-bosch-dishwasher-under-granite-countertop).
