## How to Pause Your LG Dishwasher Mid-Cycle

Pausing your LG dishwasher during a cycle is a straightforward process. Most LG models have a clear button for this action. Knowing the correct steps prevents issues. It ensures your dishes continue to clean properly after resuming.

### Locating the Start/Pause Button

Find the Start/Pause button on your dishwasher's control panel. This button often has a triangular "play" symbol and two vertical lines for "pause." It may also just say "Start/Pause." The button is usually easy to find. It is often a prominent feature on the front or top edge of the door.

### Pressing to Pause

To pause the cycle, press the Start/Pause button once. The dishwasher will stop operating immediately. You might hear the water pump stop. The display panel will usually flash or show a "pause" indicator. This confirms the machine is in a paused state.

### Opening the Door Safely

After pausing, wait a few seconds before opening the door. This allows the internal components to settle. Water may still be very hot. Steam might escape when you open the door. Open the door slowly to avoid sudden steam release. If you need to open the door, review tips on [how to open an LG dishwasher door](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-open-lg-dishwasher-door) safely.

### Adding Items and Resuming

Once the door is open, you can add any forgotten dishes. Arrange them properly inside the racks. Close the dishwasher door firmly. Then, press the Start/Pause button again. The dishwasher will resume the cycle from where it stopped. The display panel should show the cycle continuing.

## Understanding Different Pause States: Temporary vs. Full Stop

LG dishwashers handle pauses in a few ways. It is important to know the difference. A temporary pause lets you quickly add an item. A full stop means you might need to restart the cycle. Each pause type has its own behavior and implications.

### Temporary Pause for Adding Items

When you press the Start/Pause button once, the dishwasher enters a temporary pause. The machine keeps the cycle program in its memory. It stops the water flow and wash action. The lights on the control panel may blink. This blinking indicates it is waiting for you to resume. This state is ideal for quickly adding a forgotten mug or plate. The dishwasher expects to continue soon.

### What Happens During a Temporary Pause

During a temporary pause, the dishwasher keeps track of its progress. It does not reset the cycle. Water remains inside the tub unless a partial drain occurs. The heating element stops heating water. This feature is designed for convenience. It lets you interact with the dishwasher mid-cycle.

### Full Cycle Interruption or Cancel

Sometimes you need more than a temporary pause. You might need to stop the cycle completely. To do this, you typically press and hold the Start/Pause button for a few seconds. Some models have a separate "Cancel" button. Holding the button will usually drain the water and reset the machine. This action erases the current cycle memory. If your dishwasher is not responding to controls or seems to be having issues, it might indicate [why the LG dishwasher is not working](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-the-lg-dishwasher-is-not-working) properly. After a full stop, you will need to select a new cycle and start over.

### Impact on Cycle Program

A temporary pause has minimal impact on the wash cycle. The dishwasher picks up exactly where it left off. A full stop, however, resets everything. It can also lead to water remaining in the bottom if drainage is incomplete. Understanding these differences helps you manage your dishwasher cycles effectively.

## What Happens When You Pause Your LG Dishwasher?

When you pause an LG dishwasher, several things happen inside the machine. These actions ensure safety and prepare the dishwasher for continuation. Knowing what to expect helps you use the pause function correctly.

### Immediate Cessation of Operation

As soon as you press the Start/Pause button, the dishwasher stops its current action. The spray arms stop rotating. The water pump stops circulating water. You will no longer hear the hum of the motor. The machine becomes silent or emits a soft beep.

### Partial Drain or Water Retention

Depending on the cycle stage, the dishwasher might perform a small drain. This prevents excess water from spilling when you open the door. However, in most cases, water remains in the tub. This is especially true if you pause during a wash or rinse phase. If you notice [why your LG dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) after pausing, it is often normal for the current cycle stage. This water allows the cycle to resume seamlessly.

### Door Unlocking and Safety Features

Most LG dishwashers will unlock the door a few moments after pausing. This allows you to open it safely. The machine's internal sensors detect the door opening. Some models may engage a child lock feature to prevent accidental opening, so you might need to know [how to unlock your LG dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-unlock-your-lg-dishwasher) first. The heating element also shuts off immediately. This prevents scalding from hot water or steam. Safety is a top priority in their design.

### Cycle Memory and Display Update

The dishwasher retains memory of its cycle progress. It remembers which part of the cycle it was in. The display panel will change to indicate the paused state. It might show "Pause" or "PF" for Pause Function. When you resume, the dishwasher continues from that exact point. It does not restart the entire wash cycle. This memory function saves time and energy.

## When Should You Pause Your LG Dishwasher?

The pause feature on your LG dishwasher is useful in specific situations. Knowing when to use it enhances convenience and efficiency. It helps you get the most out of your appliance.

### Adding Forgotten Dishes

This is the most common reason to pause an LG dishwasher. You might load the dishwasher, start it, then find a stray spoon or plate. Pausing allows you to quickly add these items. It ensures everything gets cleaned in one cycle. This saves you from running a second, smaller load later.

### Checking Dish Placement or Detergent Dispenser

Sometimes, dishes might shift during the initial rinse. You might also want to confirm the detergent dispenser opened. Pausing the cycle lets you open the door and check. You can adjust misplaced items. You can also verify detergent release. This ensures optimal cleaning performance.

### Responding to Unforeseen Circumstances

Life happens, and sometimes you need to interrupt a cycle. Perhaps a sudden power outage occurred, and you want to ensure the dishwasher is in a safe state. Or maybe you hear an unusual noise. Pausing lets you investigate. If your dishwasher starts making [why your LG dishwasher is so loud](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dishwasher-so-loud), pausing it can help you pinpoint the source.

### Addressing Minor Issues

Occasionally, you might notice a minor issue mid-cycle. This could be a spray arm hitting an item or a filter looking clogged. Pausing allows you to address these small problems. It can prevent bigger issues later. For example, if you suspect a blockage, you might need to check the filter or drain pan. Knowing [how to replace an LG dishwasher filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-lg-dishwasher-filter) can be useful here.

## Troubleshooting Common Pause Issues with LG Dishwashers

While pausing your LG dishwasher is generally easy, you might encounter issues. Understanding these common problems helps you resolve them quickly. Most issues have simple solutions.

### Dishwasher Not Responding to Pause Button

If you press the Start/Pause button and nothing happens, check a few things. First, ensure the dishwasher is actually running a cycle. It cannot pause if it is off or idle. Next, check if the control panel is locked. Some models have a control lock or child lock feature. This feature prevents accidental button presses. If the panel is locked, you need to unlock it first. Learn [how to unlock your LG dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-unlock-your-lg-dishwasher) if this is the case. Press and hold the Lock button for a few seconds.

### Dishwasher Won't Resume After Pause

This is a common concern. After you close the door and press Start/Pause again, the dishwasher might not start. First, ensure the door is fully latched. A loose door is the most frequent reason for non-resumption. Press firmly on the door to ensure it clicks shut. If the issue persists, try pressing the Start/Pause button once more. Sometimes, a double-press is needed to reactivate it. If the dishwasher [why your LG dishwasher is not turning on](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-dishwasher-not-turning-on) after a pause attempt, check the power supply.

### Error Codes After Pausing

Occasionally, pausing or resuming might trigger an error code on the display. Common codes like "LE" (motor error) or "OE" (drain error) can appear. These usually indicate an underlying problem. If an error appears, consult your LG dishwasher manual. It lists all error codes and their meanings. Sometimes, simply canceling the cycle and restarting it can clear minor errors. If your dishwasher starts [why your LG dishwasher keeps beeping](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-keep-beeping) after a pause, it might be signaling an issue or an unclosed door.

### Water Remaining After Full Stop (Not Just Pause)

If you attempt a full stop or cancel, you expect the dishwasher to drain. If [why your LG dishwasher has water in the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom) after canceling, the drain pump might be clogged. This is not directly a pause issue, but it is related to stopping a cycle. Check the drain filter for food particles. Ensure the drain hose is not kinked. A small amount of water might remain even after a proper drain.

## Best Practices for Pausing and Resuming Cycles

Proper use of the pause feature extends your dishwasher's life. It also ensures consistent cleaning results. Follow these best practices for smooth operation.

### Minimize Pauses

While convenient, frequent pausing is not ideal. Each pause causes the dishwasher to stop and then restart its systems. This puts a slight strain on components like the motor and pump. Try to load all items before starting a cycle. This reduces the need to pause.

### Act Quickly When Paused

If you do need to pause, perform your task quickly. Add forgotten items, or make adjustments, then close the door. Do not leave the dishwasher paused for extended periods. Leaving it paused allows water to cool. It might also allow food particles to settle. This can affect wash performance.

### Ensure Proper Door Closure

When you close the dishwasher door after pausing, ensure it latches firmly. A loose door will prevent the cycle from resuming. Press the door until you hear a click. This confirms a secure seal. If the door is not fully closed, the dishwasher will not resume.

### Resume Promptly

Once you close the door, press the Start/Pause button to resume the cycle promptly. The dishwasher expects to continue its work. Delaying resumption can cause issues. It might lead to the machine thinking there is a problem. The machine may also go into a standby mode, requiring you to re-select the cycle.

### Consult Your User Manual

Every LG dishwasher model can differ slightly. Always refer to your specific model's user manual. The manual provides precise instructions for pausing and resuming cycles. It also details any unique features or troubleshooting tips for your appliance. The manual is your best resource for specific instructions.

## LG Dishwasher Features Related to Pausing

LG dishwashers come with various features designed for convenience and safety. Some of these features relate directly or indirectly to pausing a cycle. Understanding them enhances your overall experience.

### Control Lock (Child Lock)

Many LG dishwashers include a Control Lock feature. This is often called a Child Lock. It prevents accidental button presses. This is especially useful in homes with children. If the control lock is active, you cannot pause or interact with the panel. You must disable it first. To disable it, press and hold the Control Lock button for a few seconds. This feature prevents children from accidentally opening the door mid-cycle. You can learn more about [how to unlock your LG dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-unlock-your-lg-dishwasher) if this lock engages.

### Cycle Status Indicators

LG dishwashers often have clear display panels. These panels show the current cycle status. When you pause the dishwasher, the display will change. It might show "Paused" or "PF." Some models have progress indicator lights. These lights might blink or change color when paused. These indicators help you understand what the dishwasher is doing. They let you know it is waiting for your input.

### Delayed Start Feature

While not a direct "pause" feature, Delayed Start relates to cycle timing. It lets you program the dishwasher to start at a later time. This means you do not need to pause a cycle if you plan to be away. You can load it, set the delay, and it will start on its own. This feature allows for flexible scheduling. It can also help manage energy usage during off-peak hours.

### Smart Diagnosis™ and Wi-Fi Connectivity

Newer LG dishwashers may include Smart Diagnosis™ or Wi-Fi connectivity. These features can help with troubleshooting if a pause causes an issue. If your dishwasher fails to resume, you might use the Smart Diagnosis™ app. It can send signals to your phone. These signals can help diagnose the problem.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Pausing LG Dishwashers

### Can I open my LG dishwasher immediately after pausing?
It is best to wait a few seconds after pausing. This allows the spray arms to stop moving. It also allows any internal pressure to equalize. Open the door slowly to avoid hot steam escaping. Safety is always important when dealing with hot appliances.

### Will pausing affect the wash quality of my dishes?
A brief pause typically does not affect wash quality. The dishwasher remembers its cycle progress. It resumes from that exact point. Leaving the dishwasher paused for a long time can cool the water. This might slightly impact cleaning effectiveness, especially during a heated wash phase.

### What if my LG dishwasher won't resume after I pause it?
First, ensure the door is closed completely and latched. Press firmly on the door until you hear it click. Then, press the Start/Pause button again. If it still does not resume, check for any error codes on the display. You might need to cancel the cycle and restart it.

### Is it bad for the dishwasher to pause it often?
Occasional pausing is fine and designed into the machine. However, frequently pausing and restarting can put extra strain on the motor and pump. These components work harder to stop and restart. Try to load everything before starting a cycle to minimize pauses.

### Does pausing save water or energy?
Pausing a cycle does not save water or energy significantly. The water remains in the tub, and the machine stays in a standby mode. The most effective way to save resources is to run full loads. Also, choose appropriate wash cycles for your dish soil level.

### How do I cancel a cycle instead of just pausing?
To cancel a cycle, usually press and hold the Start/Pause button for a few seconds. Some LG models have a dedicated "Cancel" button. This action typically drains the water and resets the dishwasher. You will then need to select a new cycle to start washing again.
