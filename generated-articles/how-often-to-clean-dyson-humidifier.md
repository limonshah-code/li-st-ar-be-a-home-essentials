*   Continuous operation means more water passes through the system. This leads to faster mineral buildup and quicker bacterial growth.
*   If your humidifier is a seasonal device, used only in winter, ensure a thorough clean before storing it and before bringing it back out.

**Air Quality and Environment:**
*   The general cleanliness of your home environment also plays a role. A dusty room can lead to dust settling inside the humidifier.
*   Similarly, if you have pets, pet dander can get into the air intake. This can contribute to internal dirt buildup.
*   If your indoor air quality is poor, or if you live in a high-pollen area, you might need to clean the exterior and filters more often.

**Signs of Buildup or Contamination:**
*   Sometimes, your humidifier tells you it needs cleaning. Look for visible mineral deposits on the water tank or base.
*   An unpleasant smell coming from the humidifier is a strong indicator of bacterial or mold growth. This means immediate cleaning is necessary. Learn more about [why your Dyson humidifier smells](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-dyson-humidifier-smell) in our guide.
*   Reduced mist output or unusual noises can also signal clogs or component issues due to buildup. If you notice these signs, clean your humidifier right away.

By considering these factors, you can create a personalized cleaning schedule. This ensures your Dyson humidifier always runs efficiently. It also ensures it provides the cleanest air possible.
