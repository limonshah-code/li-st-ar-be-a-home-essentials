Most LG dishwashers do not come with a power cord. Manufacturers typically sell dishwashers with the expectation of either hardwiring or a separately purchased power cord kit. This practice ensures compliance with diverse local electrical codes and consumer preferences for installation methods. You will need to plan for this connection during your setup.

## Understanding Dishwasher Power Cord Standards for LG Appliances

When you purchase a new LG dishwasher, you might expect it to arrive with everything needed for immediate use. However, you will find that a power cord is typically not included. This is a standard industry practice, not specific to LG. Many major appliance brands follow this same approach for their dishwashers.

There are good reasons behind this common policy. Electrical codes vary significantly from one region to another. Some areas require appliances like dishwashers to be hardwired directly into the home's electrical system. Other areas permit the use of a plug-in cord. Providing a cord for every unit would mean supplying multiple cord types. It would also lead to many unused cords if hardwiring is the chosen method.

### The Rationale Behind Missing Power Cords

Manufacturers design dishwashers for installation flexibility. Your home's electrical setup might prefer a direct wire connection. This is often seen as a more permanent solution. It can also reduce clutter behind the appliance. Some homes have a dedicated outlet for the dishwasher. In these cases, a power cord is necessary.

Manufacturers would face challenges if they included a cord. They would need to guess which type of connection you use. They would also need to account for different plug configurations worldwide. Instead, they provide a product that can adapt to either method. This allows installers to meet local code requirements. It also lets homeowners choose their preferred connection. This flexibility helps streamline the manufacturing process. It also avoids waste from discarded cords.

### Regional Electrical Codes and Appliance Design

Electrical safety codes are crucial for appliance installation. These codes ensure safe operation and prevent hazards. Local codes dictate whether hardwiring or a plug-in connection is appropriate. They also specify the type of wire and circuit breaker needed. LG, like other manufacturers, must design appliances to meet these diverse regulations.

A universal power cord would not satisfy all these different codes. For example, some jurisdictions might require a specific gauge of wire. Others might mandate an electrical disconnect switch near the appliance. By omitting the cord, LG allows the installer to supply the correct components. This ensures compliance with local laws. It also promotes a safer installation for your home. Always check your local electrical codes before beginning any electrical work.

## Hardwiring vs. Plug-In Installation: Your LG Dishwasher Options

You have two primary options for connecting your LG dishwasher to power. You can hardwire it directly into your home's electrical system.

Your choice often depends on your existing electrical setup. It also depends on local building codes. Both methods are safe when installed correctly. However, they require different levels of electrical work. If you are unsure, consult a qualified electrician. They can assess your home's wiring. They can also recommend the safest and most compliant method.

### Hardwiring Your LG Dishwasher

Hardwiring involves connecting the dishwasher's internal wiring directly to your home's electrical circuit. This means no visible plug. The wires run from the dishwasher into a junction box in the wall or under the sink. This method creates a clean, integrated look. It is often preferred for a permanent installation.

Hardwiring requires expertise in electrical connections. You must correctly strip wires and secure them with wire nuts. The connection must be made to a dedicated circuit breaker. This circuit should match the dishwasher's voltage and amperage requirements. Many building codes require hardwiring for dishwashers. Always consult your local electrical codes before attempting this yourself. If you are not comfortable with electrical work, hire a professional. This ensures safety and compliance.

### The Power Cord Plug-In Method

The plug-in method is generally simpler for homeowners. It involves attaching a specific power cord kit to the dishwasher. This cord then plugs into a dedicated 120-volt grounded outlet. This outlet must be located within reach of the dishwasher. It cannot be behind the appliance where it would be crushed.

If you choose this method, you must purchase an approved dishwasher power cord kit. These kits include the cord, a strain relief, and wire nuts. The strain relief protects the wires where they enter the dishwasher's junction box. Connecting the cord to the dishwasher involves opening a small access panel. You then attach the cord's wires to the corresponding terminals inside. This method offers flexibility. It allows easier disconnection if you need to move the appliance for repairs or cleaning. Many people find this method more convenient. It avoids direct wiring into the house's electrical system.

## Choosing the Right Power Cord for Your LG Dishwasher

If you decide to use the plug-in method for your LG dishwasher, selecting the correct power cord is crucial. You cannot simply use any extension cord or a cord from another appliance. Dishwashers require a specific type of cord that meets safety standards. Using the wrong cord can pose a fire hazard or damage your appliance.

Always look for a power cord specifically designed for dishwashers. These cords are typically sold as "dishwasher power cord kits." They come with all the necessary components for a safe connection. These components include the cord itself, a strain relief, and appropriate wire nuts. Ensuring the cord is rated for the correct voltage and amperage is vital.

### Cord Specifications and Safety Certifications

A proper dishwasher power cord must meet specific specifications. It should be a 3-prong grounded cord. This ensures proper grounding and electrical safety. The cord's wire gauge must be sufficient for the dishwasher's electrical load. Most dishwashers require a 16-gauge or 14-gauge wire. Always check your LG dishwasher's manual for exact requirements.

Look for cords with safety certifications from recognized organizations. In North America, the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listing is standard. A UL-listed cord indicates it has been tested and meets stringent safety standards. This certification provides peace of mind regarding the product's quality and safety. Avoid uncertified or generic cords. They might not offer adequate protection. Using a certified cord helps protect your appliance and your home.

### Where to Purchase an LG Dishwasher Power Cord

You have several options for purchasing a power cord for your LG dishwasher. The most reliable place is often the same retailer where you bought the dishwasher. Major appliance stores usually stock compatible power cord kits. They can also guide you toward the correct one for your LG model.

You can also find these kits at hardware stores or home improvement centers. Brands like Whirlpool, GE, and Bosch also have specific dishwasher power cord requirements. You can compare different options, for instance, by checking if a [Whirlpool dishwasher comes with a power cord](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-whirlpool-dishwasher-come-with-power-cord) or if a [GE dishwasher includes a power cord](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-ge-dishwasher-come-with-power-cord). Online retailers are another convenient source. When buying online, ensure the product description clearly states it is for dishwashers. Check for compatibility with 120V dishwashers.

## Essential Accessories You'll Need for LG Dishwasher Installation

Installing your LG dishwasher involves more than just connecting power. Several other accessories are crucial for proper function and safety. Thinking ahead about these items saves time and prevents installation delays. A complete setup requires attention to water supply, drainage, and structural support.

These components ensure your dishwasher operates efficiently. They also prevent leaks and other issues. Do not overlook these parts. Missing even one small item can halt your entire installation. Always check your LG dishwasher's installation manual. It lists all required and recommended parts.

### Water Supply Line Considerations

Your LG dishwasher needs a consistent water supply. This requires a water supply line. Dishwashers typically use a flexible braided stainless steel hose. This hose connects the dishwasher's water inlet valve to your home's hot water supply. The standard length is usually 6 feet. Ensure the hose has the correct fittings for both ends.

You might also need a water shut-off valve under your sink if one is not already present. This valve allows you to turn off the water supply to the dishwasher independently. It is important for maintenance or in case of a leak. Make sure all water connections are tight. Use thread sealant tape (Teflon tape) on threaded connections to prevent leaks. This simple step can save you from future headaches.

### Drain Hose Connections and Air Gaps

The dishwasher needs to drain dirty water. This requires a drain hose. Many LG dishwashers come with a drain hose already attached or included. If it does not, you will need to purchase one. The drain hose connects to your sink's drain line or a garbage disposal. It routes the dirty water away from the dishwasher. For more on this, you can learn if [LG dishwashers come with a drain hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-lg-dishwasher-come-with-drain-hose).

An air gap or a high loop is often required for proper drainage. An air gap prevents dirty drain water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It is a small fitting usually installed on the countertop next to the faucet. A high loop achieves a similar anti-siphon effect. It involves routing the drain hose up high under the sink before connecting it to the drain. This ensures water only flows out, not back in. Check local plumbing codes to determine if an air gap is mandatory in your area.

### Installation Brackets and Sound Dampening

Dishwashers need to be securely fastened in place. Installation brackets are used for this purpose. They attach the dishwasher to the underside of the countertop or to the side cabinets. These brackets prevent the dishwasher from tipping forward when the door is open. They also reduce vibration and noise during operation. Most LG dishwashers include these brackets in the packaging.

Consider sound dampening materials if you want a quieter dishwasher. Some high-end LG models come with advanced insulation. For others, you might add sound dampening mats to the sides and top of the dishwasher cavity. These materials absorb vibrations. They reduce the amount of noise that transfers to your kitchen cabinets. This creates a more peaceful kitchen environment while your dishwasher runs.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Installing a Power Cord on Your LG Dishwasher

Installing a power cord on your LG dishwasher is a task you can do yourself. However, it requires careful attention to safety and proper electrical connections.

### Connecting the Power Cord to the Dishwasher

The power cord connects to a terminal box on the front underside of the dishwasher. First, locate this access panel. It is usually a small metal box with a cover. Use a screwdriver to remove the cover. Inside, you will see three terminals: one for the black (hot) wire, one for the white (neutral) wire, and one for the green (ground) wire.

Thread the power cord through the strain relief. Then, attach the strain relief to the opening in the terminal box. This prevents the cord from being pulled out accidentally. Strip about 1/2 to 3/4 inch of insulation from the ends of the power cord's wires. Connect the black wire from the cord to the black terminal on the dishwasher. Connect the white wire to the white terminal. Finally, connect the green (ground) wire to the green terminal screw. Use wire nuts to secure these connections if your model requires them, or tighten screw terminals firmly.

### Securing Electrical Connections

After connecting the wires, ensure they are secure. Tug gently on each wire to confirm it is firmly attached. Loose connections can lead to electrical hazards or intermittent power. Once all wires are connected and secure, replace the terminal box cover. This protects the connections from moisture and physical damage.

Route the power cord neatly so it does not interfere with the dishwasher's movement or plumbing. Ensure the cord is not pinched or crimped. You can now plug the cord into the dedicated outlet. Before fully pushing the dishwasher into place, do a preliminary test. Turn the circuit breaker back on. Briefly turn on the dishwasher to ensure it powers up. Check for any unusual noises or smells. If everything seems fine, you can proceed with the rest of the installation, such as water lines and securing the unit.
