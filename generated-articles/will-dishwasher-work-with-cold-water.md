However, the internal heater takes time and energy. It works harder to heat cold water. It starts from a lower temperature. This process can extend wash cycle times. It might also use more electricity. Your dishwasher's performance still relies on hot water. The machine ensures that heat with its built-in system.

## Understanding Dishwasher Water Supply Needs

Dishwashers need water to clean dishes. They use specific temperatures for different stages. Most dishwashers are designed for hot water connections. This is because hot water helps remove food residue. It also aids in dissolving detergents. Hot water is crucial for effective sanitization.

Traditional setups connect dishwashers to the hot water supply. This helps the dishwasher start with warm water. It reduces the work of the internal heater. This also shortens cycle times. The machine still has a heater. It boosts the water temperature. This ensures it reaches very hot levels. These levels are necessary for proper cleaning and sanitizing. Understanding your dishwasher’s specific needs is important. Some models work better with existing hot water. Others handle cold water well.

### How Dishwashers Use Water Temperature

Dishwashers use water at different temperatures throughout a cycle. First, a pre-rinse often uses cooler water. This helps remove loose food particles. Then, the main wash cycle requires very hot water. Temperatures can reach 120-150°F (49-65°C). This heat activates detergents. It also breaks down grease and grime.

Finally, a hot rinse or sanitization cycle occurs. Water can heat up to 155°F (68°C) or higher. This high temperature kills germs. It also helps dishes dry faster. Modern dishwashers have powerful heaters. They ensure these temperatures are met. They do this even when connected to cold water. This makes sure the dishes are truly clean.
