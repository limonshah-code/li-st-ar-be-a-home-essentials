If you are using a new hose, ensure it is rated for the pressure your compressor can produce. Once the hose is connected, you are almost ready. Give the compressor a quick visual check. Look for any loose parts or obvious damage. This quick check takes only a moment. It helps prevent future issues.

### Inflating Tires with Your Dewalt Portable Compressor

Inflating tires is one of the most common uses for a Dewalt portable air compressor. It is a simple process once you know the steps. First, find the recommended tire pressure (PSI) for your vehicle. This information is usually on a sticker inside your car's driver-side door jamb. You can also find it in your vehicle owner's manual. Do not guess the PSI. Using the wrong pressure can be dangerous.

Connect the air hose to your compressor. Then, attach a tire chuck to the end of the air hose. Most tire chucks simply clip onto the tire's valve stem. Before attaching, make sure the valve stem cap is removed. Secure the chuck firmly onto the valve stem. You should hear a slight hiss of air. This confirms a connection.

Now, adjust the pressure regulator on your Dewalt compressor. Turn the knob until the pressure gauge reads your desired PSI. Turn on the compressor. It will begin filling the tire. Watch the tire pressure gauge on the compressor or on a separate tire gauge. Stop filling when you reach the correct PSI. I often slightly overfill and then release air to fine-tune the pressure. This method works well for me. If you have a specific Dewalt compressor model like the DWFP55126, the process remains similar, but consulting your specific model’s manual can be helpful.
