## Pattern Play: Choosing Bedspreads with Designs

The pattern should either incorporate blue or complement it beautifully. This helps to create a cohesive and stylish bedroom.

### Scale and Dominance

Consider the scale of the pattern. A large, bold pattern can become the room's main statement. A small, subtle pattern adds texture without dominating. If your room is small, smaller patterns or subtle textures often work best. If you have a large room, you can handle larger patterns. The bedspread should complement, not compete with, the light blue carpet.

## Considering Room Elements: Walls, Furniture, and Lighting

Choosing a bedspread is not just about the carpet. The other elements in your room play a big role. Your wall color, furniture style, and lighting all influence how a bedspread looks. Thinking about these existing elements helps you make the best choice. This ensures a truly cohesive and inviting bedroom space.

### Wall Color Synergy

Your wall color significantly affects the room's overall palette. If your walls are white, cream, or light gray, many bedspread colors will work. These neutral walls provide a clean canvas. If your walls are a different shade of blue, consider a bedspread that offers a slight variation or a gentle contrast. For example, [what colour carpet goes with sky blue walls](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-colour-carpet-goes-with-sky-blue-walls) provides similar insight for creating harmony with blue tones.

Light wood or white furniture offers more flexibility. It can pair with cool blues, grays, or even bright white. Metal furniture, like iron or brass, also influences the feel. A charcoal bedspread could complement dark metal. A soft blush could highlight brass.

### Impact of Natural and Artificial Lighting

Lighting changes how colors appear. A room with lots of natural light can handle darker bedspread colors. The light will brighten them. A room with less natural light might benefit from lighter bedspreads. These colors will make the room feel brighter. Artificial lighting also affects color perception. Warm light bulbs can make cool colors seem warmer. Cool light bulbs can make warm colors appear muted. Test bedspread samples in your room at different times of day. This helps you see how the color truly looks. Understanding [how to choose carpet color](https://homeessentialsguide.co m/how-to-choose-carpet-color) also includes considering lighting.

### Can I use a dark bedspread with light blue carpet?

Yes, a dark bedspread can create a striking contrast with light blue carpet. Dark colors like navy, charcoal gray, or deep teal add drama and sophistication. This pairing helps ground the room and can make the lighter carpet pop. Balance the dark bedspread with lighter accent pillows or wall decor to maintain brightness.

### What about patterned bedspreads?

Consider the scale of the pattern; large patterns make a bold statement, while smaller patterns offer subtle texture. Ensure the pattern's style matches your room's aesthetic.

### Should my bedspread match my walls?

Your bedspread does not need to perfectly match your walls. In fact, creating subtle variations in color can add depth and interest to your room.
