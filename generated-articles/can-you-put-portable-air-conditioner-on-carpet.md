### Optimizing Airflow and Efficiency on Carpeted Surfaces

Proper airflow is vital for a portable air conditioner to operate efficiently and effectively. Carpeted surfaces can sometimes impede this airflow. I want your unit to cool your space effectively without working harder than it needs to.

Portable air conditioners typically have air intake vents located on their sides or at the bottom. When placed directly on thick carpet, the carpet fibers can partially block these vents. Restricted airflow reduces the amount of air the unit can draw in, which decreases its cooling capacity. This forces the compressor to run longer to reach the desired temperature, consuming more energy.

To ensure optimal airflow, elevate the portable AC unit slightly. Placing it on a sturdy, flat platform, like a piece of plywood or a thick plastic tray, can provide this elevation. This lifts the unit above the carpet fibers, ensuring the intake vents are clear and can draw in air freely. The platform should be wider than the unit to maintain stability.

Maintain at least 12-18 inches of clearance around all sides of the portable air conditioner. This includes the front, back, and sides. Do not place the unit too close to walls, furniture, or curtains. Adequate space allows for proper air intake and exhaust, which is crucial for efficient heat exchange and cooling.

Regularly clean the air filters of your portable air conditioner. Clogged filters restrict airflow even if the unit is elevated. Dirty filters force the unit to work harder, reducing efficiency and potentially leading to system problems. Refer to your unit's manual for specific cleaning instructions. Cleaning the filters is a simple yet effective way to maintain peak performance.
