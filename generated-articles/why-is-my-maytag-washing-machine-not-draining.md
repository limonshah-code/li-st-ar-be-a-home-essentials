### Takeaway

*   **Check the Drain Hose First:** Look for kinks or blockages in the hose behind the washer.
*   **Clean the Drain Pump Filter:** Lint, coins, or small items often clog this filter.
*   **Inspect the Lid Switch/Door Lock:** A faulty switch prevents the drain cycle from starting.
*   **Verify Power and Error Codes:** Make sure the machine has power and check for any displayed error codes.
*   **Consider a Faulty Drain Pump:** If clogs and switches are fine, the drain pump might need replacement.

### Why is my Maytag washing machine not draining?

Your Maytag washing machine is not draining usually because of a clog in the drain hose or pump filter. Other causes include a faulty drain pump, a malfunctioning lid switch or door lock, or an electronic control board error. Addressing these common problems often restores proper drainage.

## Understanding Your Maytag's Drainage System

Your Maytag washing machine uses a simple system to remove water. During the wash and rinse cycles, water fills the tub. After these cycles, the machine must drain this water. The drainage process moves water from the tub, through a filter, to the drain pump, and out the drain hose.

This system works well when all parts function correctly. The drain pump is a key part. It pushes water out of the machine. The drain hose carries this water away. Any disruption in this flow prevents proper drainage. Understanding these steps helps pinpoint the problem. Knowing how your washer works makes troubleshooting easier.

### How Your Maytag Washer Drains Water

The drainage cycle starts when your washer finishes a wash or rinse. The control board sends a signal to the drain pump. The pump then activates and begins to pull water from the tub. This water first passes through a filter, often called a coin trap or lint filter. This filter catches small items and lint. After filtering, the water flows through the drain pump impeller. The impeller forces the water out through the main drain hose.

This hose typically goes into a standpipe or a utility sink. The water leaves the machine and goes into your home's drainage system. If any part of this path is blocked or broken, water will remain in the tub. You can learn more about how to manually drain your machine if needed [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-my-maytag-washing-machine).

### Key Components in the Drainage Path

Several components must work together for successful drainage.

*   **Drain Pump:** This motor-driven component creates suction and pressure. It physically moves the water out of the tub. If the pump fails, water cannot exit.
*   **Drain Hose:** This flexible hose connects the pump to your home's drain. Kinks or clogs here stop water flow.
*   **Drain Pump Filter/Coin Trap:** This filter protects the pump from debris. It catches items like coins, buttons, or excess lint. A clogged filter restricts water flow.
*   **Water Level Sensor (Pressure Switch):** This part tells the control board how much water is in the tub. If it sends a wrong signal, the machine might not drain.
*   **Lid Switch/Door Lock:** These safety switches prevent operation when the lid or door is open. If faulty, they can prevent the spin and drain cycles from starting.
*   **Control Board:** This is the machine's brain. It sends signals to all parts. A faulty control board can cause incorrect drain cycle commands.

Each of these parts plays a vital role. A problem with any one component can stop your Maytag washing machine from draining. We will now look at specific problems you can check. Knowing the components helps you diagnose the issue accurately. Knowing how much water your Maytag uses can also help you understand normal operation [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-much-water-does-maytag-washing-machine-use).

## The Culprit: Clogged Drain Hoses and Filters

When your Maytag washing machine does not drain, clogs are the most common cause. They are also often the easiest to fix. Clogs can happen in two main places: the drain hose itself or the drain pump filter. Both block the path for water to leave the machine. I always check these first before anything else. It is a quick and effective diagnostic step.

A clogged drain system stops water flow. This leaves your clothes wet and the tub full. Regular maintenance helps prevent these issues. Ignoring small clogs can lead to bigger problems later. We will walk through how to check and clear these common blockages.

### Inspecting and Clearing the External Drain Hose

The drain hose is a long, flexible tube at the back of your washing machine. It connects to the pump and then to your home's standpipe or utility sink. Issues here are often simple.

First, gently pull your Maytag washing machine away from the wall. Be careful not to damage anything. Locate the drain hose. It is usually a corrugated plastic hose.

Look for any visible kinks or bends in the hose. A kink acts like a dam, stopping water flow. Straighten any kinks you find. If the hose looks clear, the problem might be an internal blockage.

To check for an internal blockage:

*   **Remove the hose:** Disconnect the drain hose from the standpipe or utility sink. Place the end into a bucket. This prevents water from spilling.
*   **Lower the hose:** If water flows out, the problem is likely in your home's drain. If no water flows, the blockage is in the hose or inside the machine.
*   **Clear the hose:** Use a long, thin brush or a plumbing snake to clear any debris. Push it through the hose gently. You might find lint, soap residue, or small items.
*   **Check the connection:** Ensure the hose is not pushed too far into the standpipe. If it is too deep, it can create a siphoning effect, leading to drain issues. Leave an air gap.

### Cleaning the Internal Drain Pump Filter (Coin Trap)

The drain pump filter, sometimes called a coin trap, catches debris before it reaches the pump. This protects the pump from damage. However, it can become clogged over time. Lint, coins, buttons, or even small toys often end up here.

Accessing the filter varies by Maytag model. It is usually behind a small access panel at the bottom front of the machine.

Here are the steps to clean it:

*   **Turn off power:** Unplug the washing machine from the wall outlet. This is a crucial safety step.
*   **Prepare for water:** Place towels on the floor and have a shallow pan or bucket ready. Water will likely drain out when you open the filter. You can also review how to properly drain your machine [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-my-maytag-washing-machine) before starting.
*   **Locate the access panel:** Open the small door at the bottom front of your Maytag washer. You might need a screwdriver.
*   **Find the filter:** You will see a large, round knob or cap. This is the filter.
*   **Open the filter:** Slowly turn the filter counter-clockwise to open it. Allow water to drain into your pan.
*   **Remove debris:** Pull out the filter. Clean off any lint, coins, or other foreign objects. Use an old toothbrush if needed.
*   **Clean the housing:** Look inside the filter housing for any remaining debris.
*   **Reinstall:** Screw the filter back in clockwise until it is tight. Close the access panel.

Regularly cleaning this filter can prevent many drainage problems. It is a simple maintenance task that pays off. Learn more specific steps for how to clean your Maytag washing machine filter [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-your-maytag-washing-machine-filter).

## Troubleshooting a Faulty Drain Pump

If you have checked and cleared all potential clogs in the drain hose and filter, and your Maytag washing machine still does not drain, the problem might be the drain pump itself. The drain pump is the motor that actually pushes water out of your machine. When it fails, water simply sits in the tub.

A faulty drain pump can manifest in various ways. Sometimes it stops working completely. Other times, it works intermittently or makes unusual noises. Diagnosing a drain pump issue requires a bit more effort. However, it is a repair many homeowners can do themselves. Always make safety your top priority when working with appliances.

### Symptoms of a Failing Drain Pump

Several signs point to a drain pump problem. Pay attention to these indicators:

*   **No Water Movement:** The most obvious sign is water remaining in the tub after the drain cycle. You may hear a humming sound, but no water leaves the machine. This indicates the pump motor is running but the impeller is not moving water.
*   **Unusual Noises:** A failing drain pump might make loud grinding, buzzing, or whirring noises during the drain cycle. This noise often comes from a damaged impeller or a worn-out motor bearing. Sometimes, a foreign object inside the pump causes these sounds.
*   **Intermittent Draining:** Your Maytag washer might drain sometimes but not others. This suggests the pump is weak or has an intermittent electrical connection.
*   **Burning Smell:** A burning smell often indicates an overheating motor. This means the pump motor is working too hard or is about to fail completely.
*   **No Sound During Drain Cycle:** If you do not hear any sound from the pump when it should be draining, it might not be receiving power. This could be a pump failure or an electrical issue upstream.

### How to Test the Drain Pump

Testing the drain pump helps confirm if it is the problem. You will need a multimeter for this.

*   **Safety First:** Disconnect your Maytag washing machine from its power source. Unplug it completely. This is critical to prevent electric shock.
*   **Access the Pump:** The drain pump is usually at the bottom of the washing machine, near the front. You might need to tilt the machine or remove a front or back panel. Refer to your Maytag owner's manual for specific access instructions.
*   **Locate the Pump:** Once you see the pump, identify the electrical connectors attached to it.
*   **Disconnect Wires:** Carefully disconnect the electrical wires from the pump. Note their positions if they are not identical.
*   **Measure Resistance:** Set your multimeter to the Rx1 or Ohms setting. Touch one probe to each terminal of the drain pump motor. A good pump typically shows a resistance reading between 5 and 15 ohms. If the reading is zero (open circuit) or infinity (short circuit), the pump is likely faulty.
*   **Check for Power (Optional, with extreme caution):** If you are comfortable, and only after ensuring all other issues are ruled out, you can check for voltage *at the pump's connector* during a drain cycle. Reconnect the wires, plug in the machine, and start a drain cycle. Use your multimeter to check for 120V AC at the wiring harness leading to the pump. If there is power but the pump does not operate, the pump is definitely bad. Do this only if you know how to safely test live electrical circuits.

### Steps for Replacement (Brief Overview)

If your drain pump is confirmed faulty, you will need to replace it.

*   **Order a New Pump:** Get a genuine Maytag replacement pump or a compatible aftermarket part. Ensure it matches your specific Maytag model number.
*   **Drain Remaining Water:** Before disconnecting the old pump, manually drain any remaining water from the tub. You can use the method described [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-my-maytag-washing-machine) or by opening the filter.
*   **Disconnect Hoses and Wires:** Remove the clamps holding the inlet and outlet hoses to the pump. Disconnect the electrical wires.
*   **Remove Old Pump:** The pump is usually held by screws or clips. Remove them and take out the old pump.
*   **Install New Pump:** Attach the new pump, securing it with screws or clips. Reconnect the hoses and electrical wires. Double-check all connections.
*   **Test:** Plug the machine back in and run a short drain cycle to test the new pump. Check for leaks.

Replacing a drain pump can be a challenging task. If you are unsure at any point, consider calling a qualified appliance technician. Safety is paramount when dealing with water and electricity.

## Lid Switch and Door Lock Assembly Problems

Maytag washing machines, like most modern appliances, include safety features. The lid switch or door lock assembly is one such feature. These components ensure the machine does not spin or drain with the door or lid open. This protects users, especially children, from injury. If this safety mechanism fails, your Maytag washing machine may not drain or spin. The machine thinks the door is open, even when it is closed.

This issue is quite common. It often leads people to think there's a more serious problem. However, a faulty lid switch or door lock can be a straightforward fix. It is important to rule this out before moving on to more complex troubleshooting steps.

### How These Safety Features Affect Draining

The lid switch and door lock assembly serve a critical purpose in your washer's operation.

*   **Lid Switch (Top-Loaders):** On top-loading Maytag washing machines, a small plunger or sensor activates when the lid closes. This switch tells the control board that the lid is shut. If the switch is faulty, it will not register the lid as closed. The machine will then prevent the high-speed spin and drain cycles from starting.
*   **Door Lock (Front-Loaders):** Front-loading Maytag washing machines use a more complex door lock assembly. This mechanism physically locks the door during cycles to prevent water leaks and injury. It also contains an electrical switch that signals the control board when the door is securely locked. If this lock fails to engage or the switch within it breaks, the machine will stop all further operations, including draining and spinning.

In both cases, the machine's control system believes a safety condition is not met. It prioritizes safety over completing the cycle. This means no draining.

### Testing and Inspecting the Lid Switch/Door Lock

Testing these components helps confirm if they are the cause.

#### For Top-Loaders (Lid Switch):

*   **Safety First:** Unplug your Maytag washing machine from the power outlet.
*   **Locate the Switch:** The lid switch is typically located underneath the main top, near the lid opening. On some Maytag models, it is inside the control panel.
*   **Access the Switch:** You might need to remove a few screws to lift the control panel or the main top of the washer. Be gentle.
*   **Visual Inspection:** Look for any visible damage to the switch or its plunger. Make sure the plunger moves freely when the lid opens and closes.
*   **Continuity Test (Multimeter):**
    *   Disconnect the wires from the lid switch.
    *   Set your multimeter to the continuity or Ohms setting.
    *   With the lid open (switch disengaged), you should usually get an open circuit (no continuity).
    *   With the lid closed (switch engaged, you might need to manually press the plunger), you should get continuity (a beep or a low Ohm reading).
    *   If the switch does not show continuity when engaged, it is faulty.

#### For Front-Loaders (Door Lock Assembly):

*   **Safety First:** Unplug the washing machine.
*   **Access the Lock:** The door lock assembly is typically mounted inside the machine's front panel, around the door opening. You may need to remove the front panel or the rubber door boot.
*   **Visual Inspection:** Check for any broken plastic parts, loose wires, or visible damage to the lock mechanism. Ensure the door latches fully.
*   **Continuity Test (Multimeter):**
    *   Disconnect the electrical connector from the door lock assembly.
    *   Set your multimeter to the continuity or Ohms setting.
    *   Test the relevant switch terminals (consult your machine's wiring diagram if unsure which ones).
    *   When the door is closed and the lock is engaged (you may need to manually engage it), you should see continuity on the switch terminals.
    *   If the switch does not register as closed when it should, the door lock assembly is faulty.

### Common Failures and What to Do

*   **Wear and Tear:** Over time, the plastic components of lid switches can break. The mechanical parts of door locks can wear out.
*   **Broken Wires:** Wires leading to the switch or lock can become loose or break.
*   **Control Board Issues:** Sometimes, the switch is fine, but the control board does not receive the signal. This is less common but possible.

If you confirm the lid switch or door lock assembly is faulty, you will need to replace it. This typically involves:

*   **Ordering the Part:** Ensure you get the correct part number for your specific Maytag model.
*   **Removing the Old Part:** Disconnect wires and mounting screws/clips.
*   **Installing the New Part:** Connect wires and secure the new assembly in place.
*   **Testing:** Run a quick cycle to ensure the machine now drains properly.

Replacing these parts is often a DIY task. It requires careful handling and attention to detail. Always follow your Maytag owner's manual for specific instructions.
