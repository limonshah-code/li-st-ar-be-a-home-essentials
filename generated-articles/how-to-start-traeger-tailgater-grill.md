Ensure your grill is placed on a stable, non-combustible surface. Keep it away from anything that can catch fire, like dry leaves or fences. You need plenty of clearance around the grill for proper ventilation. Do not use your Traeger Tailgater indoors or in enclosed spaces. Good airflow is essential for safe operation.

Finally, check the power cord connection. Make sure it is securely plugged into a grounded outdoor outlet. The Traeger Tailgater needs consistent power to run its auger, fan, and hot rod. Using an extension cord is possible, but choose one rated for outdoor use and heavy-duty appliances. Proper preparation sets the stage for a great grilling experience.

## Loading Pellets and Priming Your Traeger Tailgater Grill

Proper pellet loading is vital to **start Traeger Tailgater grill** successfully. Your grill runs on wood pellets, not charcoal or gas. These pellets are compressed sawdust, offering unique smoky flavors. Always use high-quality wood pellets specifically designed for pellet grills. Using incorrect pellets can damage your grill or affect its performance.

Open the pellet hopper lid, usually located on the left side of the grill. Pour your chosen wood pellets directly into the hopper. Fill it up to the grate, but avoid overfilling. Make sure the pellets are dry and free from any moisture. Wet pellets can swell and jam the auger system. This system feeds pellets into the fire pot.

For the very first use, or if your grill has run completely out of pellets, you need to prime the auger. This step fills the auger tube with pellets, ensuring a steady supply to the fire pot. To prime, turn on the grill and often there is a "Prime" button or option on the digital controller. If not, simply set the temperature to a higher setting like "Smoke" or 180°F, and watch for pellets to begin dropping into the fire pot. It might take a few minutes.

You can also manually prime by holding down the "Feed" button, if your model has one. This forces the auger to feed pellets. Once you see pellets consistently dropping into the fire pot, the auger is primed. A Traeger grill is also a smoker. This means it creates smoke for flavoring food.

## Understanding the Traeger Tailgater Startup Sequence

The Traeger Tailgater grill follows a specific startup sequence to ensure safe ignition. Knowing this process helps you understand what is happening inside your grill. When you **start Traeger Tailgater grill**, the digital controller takes over. First, ensure the grill lid is open. This is a critical safety step. The open lid prevents dangerous flare-ups during the ignition phase.

When you power on the grill and set a temperature, the hot rod activates. The hot rod is a small, electric heating element located in the fire pot. It heats up very quickly, reaching temperatures high enough to ignite wood pellets. Simultaneously, the induction fan starts spinning. This fan provides airflow to the fire pot, fueling the nascent flame. Good airflow is essential for proper ignition and smoke production.

As the hot rod heats the pellets, they begin to smolder and then ignite. You will see thick, white smoke billowing from the grill. This is often called "start-up smoke" or "dirty smoke." It means the pellets are burning and the fire is establishing itself. This smoke is not ideal for flavoring food, so keep the lid open during this phase. The fan also helps to clear this initial smoke.

The auger motor feeds a controlled amount of pellets into the fire pot. The controller manages the auger speed based on the desired temperature setting. It ensures a consistent fuel supply. This entire process, from hot rod activation to stable flame, takes about 5 to 10 minutes. Only after the white smoke dissipates and the grill starts producing thin, blue smoke (which is good for flavor) should you close the lid. This sequence is key to a successful start.

## Mastering the Initial Startup of Your Traeger Tailgater

Mastering the initial startup of your Traeger Tailgater is simple once you know the steps. After loading pellets and priming the auger, you are ready to **start Traeger Tailgater grill**. First, ensure your grill is plugged in and the main power switch is on. The display panel should light up.

Open the grill lid completely. This is very important for safety and proper ignition. Do not close the lid until the grill is fully ignited and producing thin, clear smoke. Next, turn the temperature dial to the desired setting. For the initial startup, setting it to "Smoke" (usually around 160-180°F) is a common practice. This low setting helps establish a consistent flame.

Now, listen for the sounds of your grill. You should hear the induction fan running and possibly the auger motor turning. Within a few minutes, you will see smoke starting to appear from the grill. This initial smoke is typically thick and white. Wait for this smoke to thin out and become more transparent, often described as "thin blue smoke." This indicates that the fire is stable and the pellets are burning efficiently.

Once you see the thin, blue smoke, you can safely close the grill lid. The grill will then work to reach the set temperature. It monitors the internal temperature with a probe and adjusts pellet feed and fan speed accordingly. Give the grill about 10-15 minutes to reach the set temperature. This is also a good time to preheat your cooking grates. Always ensure your grill grates are clean for the best cooking results. Understanding [how to clean your grill pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-grill-pan) is helpful for grill maintenance.

## Troubleshooting Common Traeger Tailgater Startup Issues

Even with careful preparation, you might encounter issues when you try to **start Traeger Tailgater grill**. Do not worry; many common problems have simple solutions. One frequent issue is the grill not igniting. This often happens if the hot rod is not getting hot enough or if there are no pellets in the fire pot. Check the pellet hopper first to ensure it has enough pellets. If the hopper is full, check for an auger jam. Sometimes wet or broken pellets can block the auger.

Another problem is the grill showing an "ER1" or "LEr" code, indicating a low temperature error. This means the grill failed to reach its target temperature within a set time. This can be due to an empty hopper, a bad hot rod, or even extreme cold weather affecting ignition. If it is cold, try starting the grill on a higher setting, like 350°F, to help it ignite faster. Always ensure the lid is open during startup.

Sometimes, the fan might not be running. The induction fan is crucial for providing oxygen to the fire. If the fan is not spinning, the pellets will not ignite properly. Check the power connection and ensure no debris is blocking the fan blades. An overloaded circuit can also prevent proper operation. Ensure your outlet provides sufficient power.

If the grill continuously feeds pellets without ignition, a "flameout" might have occurred. Turn off the grill, clear the fire pot of excess pellets, and try starting again. Always perform a thorough cleaning, especially of the fire pot and drip tray, if you frequently encounter issues. Regular cleaning prevents many startup problems.

## Essential Maintenance for Your Traeger Tailgater's Longevity

Regular maintenance extends the life of your Traeger Tailgater grill and ensures easy startups. After you **start Traeger Tailgater grill** and use it frequently, cleaning becomes very important. One of the most crucial tasks is cleaning the fire pot. Ash buildup in the fire pot can smother the hot rod and prevent proper ignition. Use a shop vac to remove ash from the fire pot and around the hot rod frequently.

Cleaning the drip tray is another essential task. Grease and drippings accumulate on this tray, especially with heavy use. If left uncleaned, grease can build up and potentially cause grease fires. This can also affect the temperature control and overall performance. Make sure to scrape off accumulated grease and dispose of it properly.
