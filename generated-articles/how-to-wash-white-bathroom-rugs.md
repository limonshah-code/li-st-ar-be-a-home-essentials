## Preparing Your White Bathroom Rugs for Washing

Getting your white bathroom rugs ready before washing makes a big difference. This first step helps remove loose dirt and prepares the fabric for a deep clean. Proper preparation ensures you achieve the best possible results. It also prevents dirt from spreading during the wash cycle.

Start by taking your white bathroom rug outside and giving it a good shake. This simple action helps dislodge any loose hair, dust, or crumbs. You might be surprised by how much debris comes out.
