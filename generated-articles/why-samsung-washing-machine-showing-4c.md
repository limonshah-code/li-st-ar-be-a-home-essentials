## Fix Your Samsung Washer 4C Error: No Water Supply

Imagine you are ready to do a load of laundry. You load your clothes into the Samsung washing machine, add detergent, and press start. Instead of the familiar hum of water filling the drum, you see "4C" flashing on the display. This error code can stop your laundry day cold. It signals a problem with the water supply.

Understanding the 4C error is the first step to a solution. This guide helps you fix this common issue. We explain what causes the 4C error. We also provide clear, easy steps to resolve it yourself. Soon, your Samsung washing machine will work correctly again.

### Takeaway

*   The 4C error on a Samsung washing machine means there is a problem with the water supply.
*   Check that water faucets are fully open.
*   Inspect and clean water inlet hoses and filters.

The "4C" error code on a Samsung washing machine indicates an issue with the water supply. This means your washer is not getting enough water, or no water at all, to start or continue a wash cycle. Common causes include closed water faucets, kinked hoses, clogged inlet filters, or low water pressure.

### Decoding the Samsung Washing Machine 4C Error

The 4C error code on your Samsung washing machine points to a water supply issue. This code tells you the machine does not receive water. It could be an internal or external problem. Samsung designed this code to protect your appliance.

This error prevents the wash cycle from starting or continuing. The machine needs enough water to wash clothes. Without water, internal components like the pump or heating element could get damaged. This error acts as a safety measure. It alerts you to check the water source.

A related error code is "4E." This code means the same thing. The "E" stands for error, but "4C" is more common on newer models. Both codes direct you to check the water coming into your machine. You can often fix this problem without a repair person.

My own experience with this error taught me a lot. I once saw the 4C code. I felt frustrated. I learned that many simple checks fix this quickly. This knowledge saves time and money.

### Checking External Water Connections for 4C Error

One of the simplest checks for the 4C error involves your machine's external water connections. You need to make sure the water supply lines are working. First, check the faucets where your washer connects to the wall. Ensure both hot and cold water faucets are fully open.

Sometimes, people accidentally turn these off. A partially closed faucet restricts water flow. Your Samsung washing machine needs a strong water flow to fill properly. Confirm that the handles are turned all the way on. You should see them pointing towards the "on" position.

Next, inspect the water inlet hoses. These hoses connect your washing machine to the water supply faucets. Look for any kinks, twists, or bends in the hoses. A kinked hose blocks water from flowing into the machine. Straighten any kinks you find.

Also, check for any visible damage or leaks on the hoses. A leaking hose can indicate poor water pressure or a blockage. If you see water leaking from the bottom of your machine, it might be related to a loose or damaged hose. For related issues, you can learn [why is my Samsung washing machine leaking from the bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-washing-machine-leaking-from-the-bottom). Replace any cracked or worn-out hoses immediately.

Make sure the hoses are tightly screwed onto both the washer and the wall faucets. Loose connections can also restrict water flow. Hand-tighten them if they feel loose. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the connections.

You can disconnect the hoses and check for debris. Sometimes, sediment builds up inside the hoses. This reduces water flow. Clear any blockages you find.

### Cleaning the Water Inlet Filters to Resolve 4C

Clogged water inlet filters are a very common cause of the Samsung 4C error. Your washing machine has small mesh filters. These filters are at the end of the water inlet hoses, where they connect to the back of the washer. They catch debris from your water supply.

Over time, rust, sediment, or mineral deposits can build up on these filters. This buildup restricts water flow into the machine. When enough debris accumulates, the machine cannot get enough water. This triggers the 4C error. Regularly cleaning these filters is important.

First, turn off the hot and cold water supply faucets. You must stop water flow before disconnecting anything. Next, carefully unscrew the water inlet hoses from the back of your Samsung washing machine. Be prepared for a small amount of water to leak out.

Once the hoses are off, you will see the small mesh filters inside the inlet ports. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers or tweezers to gently pull out these filters. They are typically small and circular. Be careful not to damage them.

Rinse the filters under running water. Use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away any trapped debris. Make sure all holes in the mesh are clear. If a filter is damaged, you need to replace it. You can find more detailed steps on [how to clean Samsung washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-samsung-washing-machine-filter).

After cleaning, carefully insert the filters back into the inlet ports. Make sure they are seated correctly. Reconnect the water inlet hoses to the machine. Hand-tighten them, then turn the water supply faucets back on. Run a test cycle to see if the 4C error disappears.

### Diagnosing Water Pressure Problems for Your Samsung Washer

Low water pressure can also cause your Samsung washing machine to display the 4C error. Your machine needs a certain amount of water pressure to fill correctly. If the pressure is too low, the washer cannot draw enough water. This triggers the error code.

You can check your home's water pressure. Turn on a nearby sink faucet, like in a utility room. Observe the flow of water. Is it strong and consistent? If the water trickles out, your home might have low water pressure.

Sometimes, low pressure is a temporary issue. This could be due to city water main work. It could also happen if other water-using appliances run at the same time. Try running your washer when no one else is using water in the house. This includes showers, dishwashers, or sprinklers.

If low water pressure is a consistent problem, contact your water utility company. They can tell you if there are known issues in your area. You might also have a pressure regulator on your main water line. A faulty regulator can reduce water pressure throughout your home.

You can also test the water pressure directly from the washing machine faucets. Place a bucket under each faucet. Turn the faucets fully on for about 15 seconds. You should collect at least 2-3 liters of water in that time. If you collect less, the pressure is too low.

Sometimes, issues with your home's main water line affect pressure. A partially closed main shut-off valve can cause low pressure. Ensure all main valves are fully open. If the pressure problem persists, a plumber might need to inspect your home's plumbing system. This problem is similar to what causes issues like your [Samsung washing machine not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-samsung-washing-machine-not-draining) if the water flow is too weak to activate certain components.

### Troubleshooting the Samsung Washer Water Inlet Valve

If external checks and filter cleaning do not resolve the 4C error, the water inlet valve might be faulty. This valve is an electrical component inside your Samsung washing machine. It opens to allow water into the drum. It closes to stop water flow.

The water inlet valve consists of one or more solenoids. These solenoids open and close small ports to control water flow. Over time, these solenoids can wear out. They may become stuck closed or partially open. This stops water from entering the machine.

You can test the water inlet valve. First, unplug your washing machine for safety. You will need to access the back panel of the washer. Remove the screws holding the back panel in place. Gently pull the panel away. You will see the water inlet valve connected to the water hoses.

Look for any signs of damage on the valve. Check for corrosion or cracks. You can also test the valve's solenoids with a multimeter. Each solenoid should show a specific resistance reading. If a solenoid reads open or shorted, the valve is bad.

Replacing a water inlet valve is a repair you can often do yourself. You need to order the correct part for your Samsung model. Disconnect the electrical connectors and hoses from the old valve. Then, install the new valve in its place. Ensure all connections are secure.

If you plan to perform this repair, it falls under general [do-it-yourself washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/do-it-yourself-washing-machine) repair. Remember to always use caution when working with electrical components and water. If you are not comfortable with this step, it is best to call a qualified appliance technician. A professional can diagnose and replace the valve safely.

### Considering Drainage System for 4C Issues

While the 4C error directly points to a water supply issue, sometimes a clogged drainage system can indirectly contribute. This might seem confusing. Your Samsung washing machine might think it has water if a previous cycle's water did not drain completely. This can prevent new water from entering.

If the machine believes there is water in the drum, it will not initiate a new fill cycle. It acts as a safety feature. The machine avoids overflowing. If you suspect this, check your drain hose.

First, ensure the drain hose is not kinked or blocked. The hose should run freely from the back of the washer to the drain standpipe or laundry tub. Straighten any bends. Make sure the hose is not pushed too far down into the standpipe. This can create a siphon effect.

Next, check the drain pump filter. Samsung washing machines have a filter near the bottom, often behind a small access panel. This filter catches lint, coins, or small items. A clogged filter restricts drainage. You can learn [how to drain your Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-your-samsung-washing-machine) before opening this filter to prevent water spillage.

To clean the drain pump filter:
*   Place towels on the floor to catch water.
*   Locate the access panel at the bottom front of your washer.
*   Open the panel.
*   Unscrew the small drain hose cap to let residual water drain into a shallow pan.
*   Once drained, twist and pull out the pump filter.
*   Remove any debris, lint, or foreign objects from the filter.
*   Rinse it under water.
*   Reinsert the filter and close the cap and access panel.

After clearing any drain blockages, try running a short cycle. This helps confirm if drainage was the underlying issue. Proper drainage ensures the machine is empty. An empty machine will then attempt to fill correctly.

### Resetting Your Samsung Washing Machine and When to Seek Help

After trying all the troubleshooting steps, resetting your Samsung washing machine is a good final attempt. A reset can clear temporary errors or glitches in the machine's electronic system. The 4C error might just be a false alarm caused by a momentary sensor issue.

To reset most Samsung washing machines:
1.  **Unplug the machine:** Pull the power cord from the wall outlet.
2.  **Wait 5-10 minutes:** This allows the machine's internal computer to fully discharge and reset.
3.  **Plug it back in:** Reconnect the power cord firmly.
4.  **Run a test cycle:** Select a short wash cycle to see if the 4C error has disappeared.

Some Samsung models also have a "Smart Control" or "Smart Check" feature. You can access this via the Samsung SmartThings app. The app might give more specific diagnostic information about the error code. It can also suggest basic fixes.
