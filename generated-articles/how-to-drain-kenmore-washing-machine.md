## Quick Guide: Draining Your Kenmore Washing Machine

Standing water in your washing machine can be a real headache. Perhaps your Kenmore washer stopped mid-cycle, or it just refuses to drain. No one wants soggy clothes stuck inside. Knowing **how to drain your Kenmore washing machine** is a vital skill.

This guide will walk you through the process. We cover everything from manual draining to troubleshooting common issues. You will learn the specific steps for both top-load and front-load Kenmore models. We will also explore why your washer might not be draining and provide solutions. Get ready to tackle this common appliance problem with confidence.

### Takeaway

*   Always disconnect power and water supply before starting work.
*   Manual draining typically uses the main drain hose or a small pump hose.
*   The drain pump filter is a frequent source of clogs and needs regular cleaning.
*   Check the drain hose for kinks or blockages to ensure proper water flow.
*   If basic steps fail, a professional might need to address pump or electrical issues.

To drain a Kenmore washing machine, first unplug it. Locate the drain hose at the back and place its end in a bucket on the floor. For front-loaders, the drain pump filter usually has a small hose for manual draining. Clear any clogs in the filter or pump if water does not flow out.

## Safety First: Essential Preparations for Draining Your Washer

Before you touch your Kenmore washing machine, safety must be your top priority. Water and electricity are a dangerous mix. Taking a few simple precautions prevents accidents and injury. This step ensures a safe and smooth process for draining.

You must disconnect the washing machine from its power source. Find the power cord and unplug it from the wall outlet. Do not just turn off the machine. A complete power disconnect is necessary for your safety.

Next, turn off the water supply to the washing machine. You will find two hoses connected to the back of the washer. Each hose has a corresponding spigot on the wall. Turn both spigots clockwise until they are fully closed. This prevents more water from entering the machine.

Gather your tools before you begin. You will need several buckets or a wet/dry vacuum. These items will collect the water. Have plenty of old towels ready for spills. Pliers or a flat-head screwdriver might also be useful for some steps.

Working on a wet floor is risky. Place towels around the machine. This helps absorb any spills and prevents slips. A well-prepared workspace protects both you and your home.

## Manually Draining a Kenmore Top-Load Washing Machine

Draining a top-load Kenmore washing machine is often straightforward. This method relies on gravity to remove the water. It works best if your washer is not completely full. You will need buckets and towels ready.

First, make sure the power and water supplies are off. We discussed these safety steps earlier. This prevents any accidental starts or leaks during the process. Having everything disconnected makes the job safer.

Locate the drain hose at the back of the washing machine. This hose usually runs from the back of the washer into a utility sink or a standpipe. It is typically a flexible, corrugated hose. You need to detach it from its current position.

Place the end of the drain hose into a large bucket. Make sure the bucket is on the floor. The lowest point allows gravity to do its work. Water will begin to flow out of the hose.

Be patient as the water drains. You may need to use multiple buckets if your machine is very full. The flow might be slow at first. Hold the hose securely in the bucket to prevent spills.

If the water stops flowing or flows very slowly, the hose might be kinked or clogged. Check the length of the hose for any bends. You can also try to gently lower or raise the hose end to restart the flow. Sometimes, simply adjusting its position helps. [Why won't my Kenmore washing machine not draining](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-kenmore-washing-machine-not-draining) could be caused by a simple kink in the hose.

Once most of the water has drained, you can try to tilt the machine slightly. This helps move any remaining water towards the drain hose. Be careful when tilting to avoid damaging the washer or injuring yourself. This gravity method is usually the easiest way to remove standing water from a top-loader.

## Draining a Kenmore Front-Load Washing Machine: Accessing the Drain Pump Filter

Draining a Kenmore front-load washing machine requires a slightly different approach. These models typically have a drain pump filter located at the bottom front. This filter catches lint, coins, and other small items. You need to access this area to drain the water and clean the filter.

Start by ensuring the washer is unplugged and the water supply is off. This is always the first and most important step. Gather your tools, including shallow pans or towels, as water will spill. A small bucket or container is also helpful for the initial drain.

Locate the access panel at the bottom front of your Kenmore front-loader. It is usually a small door or cover. You might need a flat-head screwdriver or a coin to open it. Gently pry it open to reveal the drain pump filter and possibly a small drain hose.

You will see a large cap, which is the drain pump filter, and sometimes a small, thin hose with a stopper. This small hose is for emergency draining. Place your shallow pan or towels directly under this area. A significant amount of water will come out.

Uncap the small drain hose first, if your model has one. Slowly pull the hose out and remove its stopper. Direct the hose into your shallow pan. Water will begin to flow out gradually. This prevents a large gush of water.

Once the water from the small hose stops, you can proceed to unscrew the main drain pump filter cap. Turn the large filter cap counter-clockwise. Be prepared for more water to spill out, even if you used the small hose. Continue to collect the water with your pans or towels.

Carefully pull out the drain pump filter once it's unscrewed. Inspect it for any debris, lint, coins, or other foreign objects. Clean the filter thoroughly under running water. Remove any hair or gunk that has accumulated.

Check the cavity where the filter sits for any remaining obstructions. Use a flashlight to see inside. You might find more small items stuck there. A clean filter allows your washer to drain properly. [Why won't my Kenmore washing machine drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-kenmore-washing-machine-drain) often points to a clogged drain pump filter.

Once clean, reinsert the filter and screw the cap on tightly. Ensure it is sealed to prevent leaks. Replace the stopper on the small drain hose and put it back into its slot. Close the access panel. You have successfully drained your front-load Kenmore washer and cleaned its filter.

## Troubleshooting Common Kenmore Draining Problems

Sometimes, draining your Kenmore washing machine is not just about moving water. It involves finding out why the water didn't drain in the first place. Several common issues can prevent your washer from emptying. Addressing these can save you a service call.

### Checking the Drain Hose for Kinks or Clogs

The drain hose is a simple but critical component. It can easily become kinked or crushed, especially if the washer is pushed too close to a wall. A kinked hose restricts water flow entirely. This is a common and easy-to-fix problem.

First, pull the washing machine away from the wall. Inspect the entire length of the drain hose. Look for any bends, twists, or sharp angles. Straighten out any kinks you find. Ensure the hose has a gradual curve.

Next, check for internal clogs. Small items like socks, lint, or hair can get stuck inside the hose. Disconnect the hose from both the machine and the standpipe/sink. You might need pliers for clamps. Shine a flashlight into the hose to look for blockages.

You can try flushing the hose with water from a garden hose. This helps dislodge any stubborn clogs. Be careful to do this outdoors or over a drain. Reconnect the hose securely after checking. Make sure the drain hose is installed at the correct height, usually between 30 and 96 inches from the floor, to prevent siphoning.

### Inspecting the Drain Pump for Obstructions

The drain pump is responsible for forcing water out of the machine. It often has a filter, which we discussed earlier for front-loaders. However, larger items can sometimes bypass the filter or get stuck directly in the pump impeller. This causes draining failure.

If you cleaned the filter and the problem persists, you might have an obstruction in the pump itself. Accessing the pump usually involves removing the front or back panel of the washer. This process varies by model. Consult your Kenmore owner's manual for specific instructions.

Once you access the pump, visually inspect the impeller. This is the spinning part that moves water. Use a flashlight to see if anything is wrapped around it. Coins, buttons, or even small pieces of fabric can jam the impeller. Carefully remove any foreign objects.

Be cautious when working near the pump. It can have sharp edges from broken objects. Using gloves is a good idea. Removing obstructions from the pump can restore drainage.

### Addressing a Malfunctioning Drain Pump

Sometimes, the pump itself is the problem. A drain pump can wear out or fail electrically. If the pump hums but does not move water, or if it makes no sound at all, it might be faulty. This means it is no longer able to push water out of the machine.

You might hear unusual noises coming from the pump area. A grinding or buzzing sound without water draining suggests the pump is struggling. This often indicates a mechanical failure within the pump. The motor might be trying to spin but cannot.

Testing a drain pump's electrical continuity requires a multimeter. This is a job for someone comfortable with electrical testing. If there is no power reaching the pump, the issue could be with the wiring or the main control board. [How to reset my Kenmore washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-my-kenmore-washing-machine) might temporarily fix minor glitches, but a truly faulty pump needs replacement.

If you suspect a faulty drain pump, it often requires replacement. This can be a DIY project for advanced users. However, for most people, it signals a time to call a professional appliance technician. Replacing a pump involves dealing with water, electrical connections, and sometimes complex mounting.

## Understanding Why Your Kenmore Washer Won't Drain

A Kenmore washing machine that won't drain can be a frustrating puzzle. Beyond simple clogs, several system-wide issues can cause this problem. Understanding these reasons helps you diagnose the root cause. This knowledge guides your repair efforts.

One common culprit is a **clogged drain pump filter**. We discussed this earlier. Lint, coins, keys, or other small items collect in this filter. Over time, they block water flow entirely. Regular cleaning prevents this very common issue.

A **kinked or obstructed drain hose** is another frequent cause. If the hose bends sharply or something blocks it internally, water cannot exit. Always ensure the drain hose has a clear path. Check behind the machine regularly.

The **drain pump itself might be faulty**. This is a mechanical or electrical failure. If the pump motor burns out, or its impeller breaks, it cannot push water. You might hear strange noises or no noise at all. This often requires pump replacement. [Why won't my Kenmore washing machine drain](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-wont-my-kenmore-washing-machine-drain) frequently points to a pump issue.

For top-load washers, a **defective lid switch** can prevent draining and spinning. The machine's control system believes the lid is open. It will not complete the cycle for safety reasons. A simple test can confirm if your lid switch is working.

**Electrical issues** can also halt the drain cycle. A loose wire, a blown fuse, or a power surge can disrupt the pump's operation. These problems often require professional diagnosis. Do not attempt electrical repairs unless you have experience.

Finally, the **main control board** can fail. This board acts as the "brain" of your washing machine. If it malfunctions, it might not send the correct signals to the drain pump. This is a less common but more expensive repair. Diagnosis often requires specialized tools.

Knowing these potential issues helps you narrow down the problem. Sometimes a simple reset can fix minor glitches. However, recurring draining problems signal a need for deeper inspection. Addressing the root cause prevents future frustration.

## Preventive Measures: Keeping Your Kenmore Draining Smoothly

Preventing problems is always better than fixing them. Keeping your Kenmore washing machine draining smoothly requires some simple habits. Regular maintenance extends the life of your appliance. These steps also save you from unexpected puddles.

**Clean the drain pump filter regularly.** For front-load washers, this is crucial. Aim to clean it every few months, especially if you wash many lint-producing items. This prevents buildup that causes clogs. It is a quick task that makes a big difference.

**Check pockets before washing.** This seems obvious, but small items are the leading cause of drain pump obstructions. Coins, paper clips, and hair ties easily find their way into the pump. Emptying pockets takes seconds but prevents hours of troubleshooting.

**Use the correct amount of detergent.** Too much detergent creates excessive suds. These suds can clog the drain lines and pump. They also leave residue inside the machine. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for detergent usage.

**Avoid overloading your washing machine.** An overloaded washer strains all its components, including the drain pump. It also means clothes do not get clean properly. Ensure there is enough space for clothes to move freely. A full drum makes it harder for water to exit efficiently.

**Inspect the drain hose periodically.** Look for kinks or signs of wear. Make sure it is not pressed against the wall. A simple visual check can catch potential problems early. Ensure the hose maintains its proper height, usually between 30 and 96 inches, to avoid constant draining issues due to siphoning.

**Run a cleaning cycle regularly.** Many Kenmore machines have a "clean washer" cycle. Use this with a washer cleaner or vinegar to remove detergent buildup and mildew. A clean interior promotes efficient draining. This helps prevent clogs and odors.
