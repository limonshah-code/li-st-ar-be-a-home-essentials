### The Clear Answer:

Ooni pizza ovens primarily use **liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)**, commonly known as **propane**. Most gas Ooni models connect to standard propane tanks. Some specific models also offer a conversion option to use **natural gas** from a home's supply. This choice depends on the Ooni model and your setup.

## Understanding Ooni's Primary Fuel: Propane Gas

Propane is the most common fuel for Ooni gas pizza ovens. It is a highly efficient and portable fuel. Many Ooni models, like the Ooni Koda 12, Koda 16, and Karu 12G (with gas burner), run on propane. This makes them ideal for backyard cooking or tailgating.

Propane provides quick and consistent heat. This allows Ooni ovens to reach high temperatures fast. You can bake a pizza in 60 seconds once the oven is hot. Propane tanks are readily available at hardware stores and gas stations. This convenience makes propane a popular choice.

Connecting your Ooni to a propane tank is straightforward. You typically attach a regulator and hose to the oven's gas inlet. Then, you connect the other end to your propane tank. Always ensure connections are tight and leak-free. Proper connection helps ensure safe operation. Learning [how to connect an Ooni pizza oven to gas](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-connect-ooni-pizza-oven-to-gas) is a crucial first step for new owners.

The Ooni Karu series are multi-fuel ovens. They can use wood or charcoal. However, they also offer an optional gas burner attachment. This burner specifically uses propane. This flexibility allows users to choose their preferred fuel for each cook.

## Exploring Natural Gas Options for Ooni Ovens

While propane is standard, some Ooni gas models can use natural gas. This option offers a permanent fuel source. It eliminates the need for propane tank refills. Natural gas is supplied directly from your home's gas line. This requires a professional installation.

Only specific Ooni models are designed for natural gas conversion. For example, the Ooni Koda 16 often has a natural gas converter kit available. This kit changes the oven's internal components. It ensures safe and efficient operation with natural gas. You cannot convert all Ooni gas ovens to natural gas. Always check your specific oven model's specifications.

Converting to natural gas offers several benefits. You have an unlimited fuel supply. This means no more running out of gas mid-pizza party. It can also be more cost-effective over time. However, it sacrifices portability. Your oven becomes fixed in one location. This might influence where you [put your Ooni pizza oven](https://homeessentialsguide.com/what-can-i-put-my-ooni-pizza-oven-on).

Installing a natural gas line for an outdoor appliance needs care. It involves connecting to your home's main gas supply. Always hire a licensed professional for this work. They ensure proper installation and safety compliance. This helps prevent gas leaks and other hazards.

## Why Butane Is Not Recommended for Ooni Ovens

Sometimes people ask if they can use butane gas for Ooni pizza ovens. While butane is also an LPG, it is generally not recommended. There are specific reasons for this. Understanding these differences helps ensure optimal oven performance.

Butane has a lower vapor pressure than propane. This means it struggles to vaporize in colder temperatures. If the ambient temperature drops below freezing, butane may not flow properly. This leads to inconsistent flame or difficulty lighting the oven. Pizza ovens need high, consistent heat to cook quickly.

Ooni ovens are designed to operate at very high temperatures. Propane burns hotter and more consistently for this purpose. Butane may not provide the necessary heat output. This can result in slower cooking times and less crisp crusts.

Using the wrong fuel type can also impact oven performance. It might affect how quickly your Ooni heats up. It could also influence the overall cooking experience. For peak performance, stick to the recommended fuel. Ooni engineers design their ovens for propane or natural gas.

Safety is another concern. Regulators for butane tanks are different from propane regulators. Using an incorrect regulator can be dangerous. Always use the specified regulator and hose for your Ooni oven. These components ensure the correct gas pressure and flow.

## Gas Regulators and Hoses: Essential Components

The gas regulator and hose are vital parts of your Ooni gas setup. They ensure safe and effective gas flow. A regulator controls the pressure of the gas from the tank to the oven. Hoses carry the gas safely. Using the correct components is non-negotiable for safety.

Ooni ovens come with a specific regulator and hose. This setup matches the oven's gas requirements. Do not use generic regulators or hoses. Always use the Ooni-provided ones or Ooni-approved replacements. Different countries have different gas standards. So, regulators are often region-specific. For example, a US regulator will differ from a UK one.

Before each use, check your gas hose for damage. Look for cracks, cuts, or kinks. A damaged hose can leak gas. This creates a serious fire hazard. If you find any damage, replace the hose immediately. Do not attempt to repair it.

Connecting the regulator correctly is also important. Ensure it fits snugly onto the gas tank valve. Use a wrench if necessary, but do not overtighten. Over-tightening can damage the connection. After connecting, perform a leak test. Apply soapy water to all connections. Bubbles indicate a leak. If you see bubbles, tighten the connection or replace the faulty part.

Proper installation and maintenance of these components are critical. They ensure your Ooni oven operates safely and efficiently. An improperly set up gas system can be dangerous. Always prioritize safety in your outdoor cooking area.
