## Does Your Frigidaire Refrigerator Use an Air Filter?

Have you ever opened your refrigerator door to find an unpleasant smell? Or maybe your fresh produce does not stay fresh for long? These issues often relate to air quality inside your appliance. Many modern refrigerators include an air filter to fight these problems. Knowing if your Frigidaire refrigerator has an air filter can help you maintain fresh food and a clean-smelling appliance.

This article helps you understand if your Frigidaire model uses an air filter. We will explain the purpose of these filters. You will learn how to find the air filter in your Frigidaire. We will also cover how to replace it and why regular replacement matters. We include tips for handling common filter questions and general odor control. This guide helps you keep your Frigidaire refrigerator working at its best.

### Takeaway

*   Many modern Frigidaire refrigerators include an air filter, often called "PureAir" or "PureAir Ultra," to control odors and keep food fresh.
*   Check your refrigerator's user manual or look for a filter compartment, usually at the top back, near the crisper drawers, or inside the door.
*   Air filters use activated carbon to absorb odor molecules, improving air quality inside the fridge.
*   Replace your Frigidaire air filter every six months for best performance.
*   Regular replacement helps prevent food odors from transferring and extends the freshness of your produce.

### Do Frigidaire Refrigerators Have Air Filters?

Yes, many newer Frigidaire refrigerator models do have an air filter. These filters help remove odors and keep the air inside fresh. They are often branded as "PureAir" or "PureAir Ultra" filters. Not all Frigidaire models have one, so checking your specific model is important.

### Understanding Refrigerator Air Filters: What They Do

Refrigerator air filters play a crucial role. They work to remove unpleasant smells from inside your appliance. These odors can come from various foods. Think of strong cheeses or leftover meals. The filter cleans the air circulating within the fridge.

Most refrigerator air filters use activated carbon. Activated carbon is a highly porous material. It has many small pores that trap odor molecules. As air passes through the filter, these molecules stick to the carbon. This process effectively removes smells from the air.

This filtration system offers several benefits. First, it stops odors from transferring between different foods. Your milk will not taste like onions. Second, it helps keep fruits and vegetables fresh longer. Some models also claim to remove airborne mold spores, though odor control is the main job. Regular maintenance of this filter is key to its performance.

Keeping your refrigerator air fresh helps maintain food quality. It also makes opening your fridge a more pleasant experience. Over time, the activated carbon becomes saturated. It can no longer absorb odors effectively. This is why regular replacement is necessary.

### Identifying If Your Frigidaire Has an Air Filter

Not all Frigidaire refrigerator models include an air filter. Older models usually do not have one. Many newer, feature-rich models do. Knowing how to check for this feature helps you maintain your appliance correctly. It also ensures you are not missing an important part of your refrigerator's design.

The easiest way to check is to consult your user manual. The manual lists all features and parts specific to your model. It will also show you the exact location of any air filter. If you do not have the physical manual, you can often find it online. Just search for your Frigidaire model number.

You can also look for clues on the refrigerator itself. Many Frigidaire models with an air filter will have "PureAir" or "PureAir Ultra" branding. This branding often appears near the filter compartment. The compartment might be labeled. Some models even have an indicator light on the control panel. This light tells you when to change the filter.

If you own other brands of refrigerators, you might wonder if they have air filters too. For example, [Does My GE Refrigerator Have An Air Filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-my-ge-refrigerator-have-an-air-filter)? Or perhaps [Does My KitchenAid Refrigerator Have An Air Filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-my-kitchenaid-refrigerator-have-an-air-filter)? Many major brands have similar filtration systems. Looking inside your fridge is the best first step. Look for a dedicated compartment or a visible filter.

### Locating the Air Filter in Your Frigidaire Refrigerator

Once you know your Frigidaire refrigerator has an air filter, finding it is the next step. The location can vary slightly between different Frigidaire models. However, most PureAir filters are in one of a few common spots. Knowing these spots helps you quickly find yours.

One common location is at the top back of the fresh food compartment. Look for a small plastic housing. It might be rectangular or oval. This housing usually has vents or slits. It might also have a small tab or lever to open it. This area is ideal for air circulation.

Another place to check is near the crisper drawers. Some Frigidaire models place the air filter here. This location helps ensure fresh air reaches produce directly. It might be a smaller compartment located just above or between the drawers. Always look for a labeled part or a small, removable cover.

Sometimes, the filter is inside the refrigerator door. This is less common for air filters but worth checking. It could be part of the door bins or a separate small compartment. Again, look for "PureAir" branding. The user manual provides the exact location for your specific Frigidaire model.

Once you find the filter, note its appearance. This helps you purchase the correct replacement. Most Frigidaire air filters are small, rectangular cartridges. They are typically white or gray. They often have a specific part number printed on them. This number is essential for buying the right new filter.

### The Importance of Replacing Your Frigidaire Air Filter

Replacing your Frigidaire air filter regularly is not just a suggestion. It is a vital part of maintaining your refrigerator's performance. Air filters are designed to absorb odors. Over time, these filters become saturated. They collect all the odor particles they can hold. Once full, they stop working effectively.

A saturated air filter cannot remove new odors. This means your refrigerator might start to smell stale. Odors from strong foods, like onions or garlic, can spread. They can even transfer to other foods. Your fresh milk might pick up a strange smell. Your butter could taste like the leftovers from last night.

Regular replacement ensures the filter actively cleans the air. This protects the freshness of your food. Fresh air inside the fridge also helps preserve produce longer. This can reduce food waste. Most manufacturers recommend changing the air filter every six months. Some models might suggest a different interval.

Your Frigidaire refrigerator might have an indicator light. This light reminds you when to replace the filter. Pay attention to this warning. Changing the filter promptly helps your refrigerator perform its best. It maintains a clean, fresh environment for all your food items. Think of it as a small investment that protects your larger food investment.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Replacing Your Frigidaire Air Filter

Replacing your Frigidaire air filter is a simple task. It takes only a few minutes. Following these steps ensures you do it correctly. This helps keep your refrigerator air clean and fresh.

1.  **Purchase the Correct Filter:** First, identify your current filter type. Frigidaire commonly uses "PureAir" or "PureAir Ultra" filters. Check your user manual for the exact model number. The filter itself might have a part number printed on it. This ensures you buy the right replacement.
2.  **Locate the Filter:** As discussed, the filter is typically at the top back of the fresh food compartment. It could also be near the crisper drawers. Look for a small plastic housing with vents.
3.  **Remove the Old Filter:** Most Frigidaire air filter housings open with a simple push or slide mechanism. Some might have a small latch. Carefully open the compartment. The old filter usually pulls straight out. Dispose of the old filter.
4.  **Install the New Filter:** Take the new filter out of its packaging. Ensure you remove any plastic wrapping. Some filters have a specific orientation. Look for arrows indicating airflow direction. Slide the new filter into the compartment. It should fit snugly.
5.  **Close the Compartment:** Snap the filter housing closed. Make sure it latches securely.
6.  **Reset the Filter Indicator (if applicable):** Many Frigidaire models have a filter indicator light. After replacing the filter, you need to reset this light. The reset process varies by model.
    *   For some models, you press and hold the "Filter" or "Reset" button on the control panel for 3-5 seconds.
    *   Other models might require you to press "Options" then "Filter Reset."
    *   Check your user manual for the exact steps for your Frigidaire refrigerator.

This simple process keeps your fridge smelling great. If you are familiar with changing filters in other appliances, this will be easy. The process is similar to how you might [How To Change Air Filter On Electrolux Refrigerator](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-change-air-filter-on-electrolux-refrigerator) since Electrolux owns Frigidaire. Remember to reset the filter light. This tells your fridge the filter is new and ready to work.

### Common Air Filter Issues and Troubleshooting

Even with an air filter, you might encounter issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems helps keep your refrigerator in top shape. Here are some common concerns related to Frigidaire air filters and their solutions.

One common issue is the filter indicator light not resetting. You replaced the filter, but the light stays on. This usually means the reset button was not held long enough or the wrong sequence was used. Refer to your user manual for the exact reset steps for your model. Sometimes, simply repeating the reset process works. If it still does not reset, check if the new filter is properly seated. A loose filter might prevent the sensor from recognizing it.

Another problem is persistent odors despite replacing the air filter. If your refrigerator still smells bad after a new filter, the odor source is likely not just airborne. It could be a spilled item or expired food. Check for hidden spills under drawers or shelves. Clean the entire interior thoroughly. Use a mild soap and water solution. You can also place an open box of baking soda inside. Baking soda absorbs odors directly.

Sometimes, strange smells can point to other refrigerator problems. For instance, if you notice odors alongside water, you might have a different issue. Learn more about common issues like [Why Does My Frigidaire Refrigerator Have Water In The Bottom](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-refrigerator-have-water-in-the-bottom). These problems are usually unrelated to the air filter but can cause odors. The air filter addresses general airborne smells. It does not fix the root cause of certain appliance malfunctions.

Finally, ensure you are using a genuine Frigidaire PureAir filter. Generic filters may not fit correctly. They might also not offer the same level of odor absorption. Using the correct part ensures your refrigerator performs as intended. If problems continue after trying these steps, you may consider contacting Frigidaire customer support.

### Beyond the Air Filter: Other Odor Control Tips for Your Frigidaire

While an air filter does a great job, it is only one part of maintaining a fresh refrigerator. Other practices are just as important. Combining filter use with good cleaning habits keeps your Frigidaire smelling clean all the time. These tips help prevent odors from forming in the first place.

First, regularly clean spills immediately. Even small drips can become smelly over time. Use a damp cloth and mild soap. Wipe down shelves, drawers, and the interior walls. A good deep clean every few months helps immensely. Remove all food items before cleaning.

Second, check for expired or spoiled food. Old food is a major source of refrigerator odors. Go through your fridge weekly. Discard anything that has gone bad. Pay attention to forgotten items in the back of shelves. Many people are surprised by what they find hiding.

Third, store strong-smelling foods in airtight containers. Onions, garlic, certain cheeses, and even some fruits can emit strong aromas. Airtight containers trap these odors. This stops them from spreading to other foods. It also keeps your refrigerator air cleaner for longer.

Fourth, use natural odor absorbers. An open box of baking soda is a classic solution. Place it at the back of a shelf. It absorbs lingering smells. Replace it every three months for best results. You can also use activated charcoal odor absorbers. These are similar to what is in your air filter. They provide an extra layer of protection against smells.

Finally, keep your refrigerator organized. Good organization makes it easier to find food. This means less food gets lost and spoils. It also makes cleaning easier. A clean, organized fridge is less likely to develop unpleasant odors. These simple steps, along with regular air filter replacement, ensure your Frigidaire stays fresh.

### FAQ Section

**Q1: How often should I change my Frigidaire air filter?**
You should change your Frigidaire air filter approximately every six months. This timeframe ensures the filter remains effective at absorbing odors. Some Frigidaire models have an indicator light that will tell you when it is time for a replacement. Always refer to your specific model's user manual for precise recommendations.

**Q2: What is the difference between a water filter and an air filter?**
A water filter cleans water for drinking and ice. It removes impurities from the water supply. An air filter, however, cleans the air inside the refrigerator compartment. It removes odors and helps keep food fresh. They perform different jobs and are located in different parts of the refrigerator.

**Q3: Can I clean my Frigidaire air filter instead of replacing it?**
No, you cannot effectively clean a Frigidaire air filter. These filters contain activated carbon designed to trap odor molecules. Once the carbon is saturated, it loses its ability to absorb. Trying to clean it will not restore its function. You must replace it with a new filter for continued effectiveness. This is similar to why you can't clean many other air filters, like those discussed in [Can You Clean An LG Refrigerator Air Filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-clean-an-lg-refrigerator-air-filter).

**Q4: What if my Frigidaire doesn't have an air filter?**
If your Frigidaire refrigerator does not have a built-in air filter, you can still control odors. Use an open box of baking soda or activated charcoal odor absorbers. Place them inside the refrigerator. Also, focus on good cleaning habits. Clean spills quickly. Store strong-smelling foods in airtight containers.

**Q5: Does the PureAir filter also remove harmful bacteria?**
Frigidaire PureAir filters primarily focus on odor removal. They use activated carbon, which is excellent at trapping airborne odor molecules. While a cleaner environment might indirectly help, their main function is not to remove harmful bacteria or viruses. For specific health concerns, consult the product specifications or Frigidaire directly.

**Q6: Where can I buy a replacement Frigidaire air filter?**
You can buy replacement Frigidaire air filters from several places. Look at appliance parts stores, major retailers, or online marketplaces. Always ensure you purchase a genuine Frigidaire PureAir or PureAir Ultra filter that matches your model's specifications. Check the part number in your user manual or on the old filter.
