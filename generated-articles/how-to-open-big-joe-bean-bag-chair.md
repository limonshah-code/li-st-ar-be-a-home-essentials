## How To Open Your Big Joe Bean Bag Chair with Ease

Do you own a Big Joe bean bag chair? Perhaps it feels a bit flat, or maybe you need to clean it deeply. Many people wonder how to open Big Joe bean bag chairs. These chairs come with a special child-safe zipper. This design prevents accidental openings. Understanding how to access the inner filling is important. This guide will show you exactly how to open your Big Joe bean bag chair. We cover the necessary tools, a step-by-step process, and tips for refilling or cleaning. You can easily bring your favorite Big Joe back to life.

### Takeaway

Opening your Big Joe bean bag chair is simple with the right technique. Here are the key steps:

*   Locate the child-safe zipper on the chair.
*   Use a paperclip to lift the zipper tab.
*   Carefully slide the zipper open.
*   Access the inner liner for refilling or cleaning.
*   Close the zipper securely when finished.

To open a Big Joe bean bag chair, find the small, hidden zipper on the chair's exterior. This zipper lacks a standard pull tab for child safety. Insert a straightened paperclip through the small hole on the zipper slider. Use the paperclip to lift the slider and gently pull it along the track to open the chair.

## Understanding Your Big Joe Bean Bag Chair's Design

Big Joe bean bag chairs are popular for comfort and durability. They feature a unique design that prioritizes safety. The main safety feature is the child-resistant zipper. This zipper does not have a traditional pull tab. This design prevents young children from easily opening the chair. It keeps the filling safely inside.

Big Joe chairs often have two layers. There is an outer cover and an inner liner. The outer cover is usually made from strong fabrics. Examples include SmartMax fabric, which resists stains and water. The inner liner holds the bean bag filling. This design makes it easier to clean the outer cover if needed. It also helps contain the filling during refilling. Knowing about these parts helps you open and care for your chair properly.

The filling itself consists of UltimaX beans. These beans are small, light, and durable. Over time, these beans can compress and lose their plumpness. This is why you might need to open your chair. Refilling helps restore its original shape and comfort. Opening the chair also allows for thorough cleaning of both the cover and the inner liner. We will now discuss what you need to get started.

## Essential Tools for Opening Your Big Joe Bean Bag Chair

Opening your Big Joe bean bag chair does not require many special tools. Most items you need are probably already in your home. Having the right tools makes the process smooth. It also helps prevent any frustration. Let's look at what you should have ready.

First, you will need a paperclip. This is the most important tool for Big Joe zippers. The child-safe zipper has a small hole where a standard zipper pull would be. A straightened paperclip fits perfectly into this hole. It acts as a temporary pull tab. Make sure the paperclip is sturdy. A flimsy one might bend or break during use.

Next, consider what you plan to do after opening the chair. If you are refilling it, you will need new bean bag filling. Big Joe sells UltimaX beans specifically for their chairs. You might also need a funnel. A large funnel helps guide the new beans into the inner liner. This significantly reduces spills and mess.

If cleaning is your main goal, have your cleaning supplies ready. This might include a vacuum cleaner for loose debris. You could also need a fabric cleaner or mild soap and water. Think about the material of your chair's cover. Different fabrics require different cleaning methods. Having these items ready saves time. It ensures you complete the job efficiently. Preparation is key for a successful project.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Safely Opening Your Big Joe Bean Bag Chair

Opening your Big Joe bean bag chair is straightforward. The key is understanding the child-safe zipper mechanism. Follow these steps carefully to access your chair's interior. This process works for most Big Joe models.

First, locate the zipper on your Big Joe bean bag chair. Big Joe chairs usually have their zippers hidden along a seam. It might be on the bottom or back of the chair. The zipper often blends in with the fabric color. Feel along the seams if you cannot see it right away. The zipper slider will be small. It will not have a large pull tab.

Once you find the zipper, straighten a paperclip. Insert one end of the paperclip into the small hole on the zipper slider. This hole is where a regular zipper pull would attach. Push the paperclip firmly through the hole. Make sure it is secure. You want to create a temporary handle.

Now, gently pull the paperclip. You need to pull the slider along the zipper track. The zipper might feel tight at first. This is normal due to its child-safe design. Take your time. Do not force it too hard. If it sticks, try wiggling the paperclip slightly. You can also try pulling it from a different angle. Once you get it moving, continue pulling until the zipper is fully open. You will now see the inner liner. This inner liner also has its own zipper. It usually has a standard pull. Open this second zipper to access the filling.

## Refilling Your Big Joe: A Practical Guide

Once you have successfully opened your Big Joe bean bag chair, you might want to refill it. Over time, the UltimaX beans compress. This makes your chair less plump and comfortable. Refilling restores its original shape. It also brings back that cozy feeling you love. This process can be messy, so prepare your workspace.

First, gather your new bean bag filling. Big Joe recommends using their UltimaX beans for optimal performance. You can buy these online or at many retail stores. Make sure you have enough. One cubic foot of beans typically refills a smaller chair. Larger chairs might need more. You will also need a large funnel. A funnel greatly helps reduce spills. It directs the beans into the chair.

Choose a good location for refilling. A garage or an outdoor area is ideal. These places are easier to clean if beans spill. Lay down a large sheet or tarp. This protects your floor or ground. It also makes cleanup simpler. Bean bag beans are very light. They can float around easily if spilled.

Open the inner liner of your Big Joe chair. This liner usually has a standard zipper pull. Position the funnel firmly into the opening of the inner liner. Slowly pour the new beans into the funnel. Take your time. Do not rush. This prevents overflow. Gently shake the chair as you pour. This helps the beans settle evenly. Stop when the chair feels plump enough for your comfort. Remember, a new bean bag chair might feel firm at first. The beans will compress slightly with use. Once finished, zip up the inner liner. Then, zip up the outer cover using your paperclip. Enjoy your newly plumped Big Joe chair.

## Cleaning Your Big Joe Chair While Open

Opening your Big Joe bean bag chair offers a perfect opportunity for deep cleaning. While you can often clean minor spills on the surface, accessing the interior allows for more thorough maintenance. This is especially helpful if you want to clean the outer cover separately. It also lets you address any odors or hidden dirt.

First, consider the outer cover. Most Big Joe bean bag covers are removable. Once you open the main zipper and the inner liner zipper, you can carefully slide the inner liner out. This separates the cover from the filling. Check the care tag on your Big Joe cover. It will provide specific washing instructions. Many covers are machine washable. If yours is machine washable, use a gentle cycle with cold water. Use a mild detergent. Avoid bleach or harsh chemicals. These can damage the fabric. After washing, tumble dry on low heat or air dry. Ensure the cover is completely dry before putting it back on.

If your chair cover is not machine washable, or if you prefer a spot clean, you can use other methods. For polyester fabric, mix mild soap with water. Use a soft cloth. Gently blot the soiled areas. Do not rub aggressively. This can spread the stain. You can find more tips on cleaning specific fabric types. For instance, learn how to clean a polyester chair properly.

While the cover is off, you can also clean the inner liner. The inner liner is not usually washed. Instead, you can vacuum it. Use a brush attachment to remove dust and debris. If there are any spills inside, blot them with a damp cloth. Make sure the inner liner is fully dry before closing the chair. If you find mold, this is the time to address it. Learn how to get mold out of a fabric chair. [how to get mold out of fabric chair](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-mold-out-of-fabric-chair). After cleaning, carefully reinsert the inner liner. Then zip both the inner and outer zippers securely.

## Troubleshooting Common Opening Issues

Sometimes, opening your Big Joe bean bag chair might present a few challenges. Do not worry. These issues are often easy to fix. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps you complete the task smoothly. Let's look at some common problems.

One frequent issue is a stuck zipper. The child-safe zipper can sometimes be stiff. This is especially true if the chair is new or has not been opened in a while. If the paperclip does not easily move the slider, apply a very small amount of lubricant. You can use a zipper lubricant. Alternatively, try a tiny bit of graphite from a pencil. Rub the pencil tip along the zipper teeth. This can help the slider move freely. Remember to use gentle pressure when pulling the paperclip. Forcing it too hard can break the slider or damage the zipper track.

Another concern is spilled beans during refilling. Bean bag beans are very lightweight. They can create a big mess quickly. If spills happen, do not panic. The best way to clean up spilled beans is with a vacuum cleaner. A shop-vac or a regular vacuum with a hose attachment works well. For smaller spills, a broom and dustpan can help. Always work on a prepared surface. A tarp or sheet makes cleanup much easier. If the beans spill in an area with static, they might stick to surfaces. A damp cloth can help pick them up.

Finally, you might have trouble re-closing the zipper. Sometimes, the fabric can get caught in the zipper teeth. This prevents it from closing properly. If this happens, gently pull the fabric away from the zipper. Wiggle the slider back and forth a little. You can also try pulling the zipper in short bursts. Ensure no fabric is bunched up near the slider. Proper alignment is key for a smooth close. Once the zipper is fully closed, remove the paperclip. Store it for future use.

## Maintaining Your Big Joe for Longevity

Opening and refilling your Big Joe bean bag chair is a great step in its maintenance. However, regular care ensures your chair lasts for many years. Proper maintenance keeps it comfortable and looking good. This extends the life of your investment.

First, regularly fluff your Big Joe chair. This helps redistribute the internal filling. The beans can settle and compress in areas of heavy use. Fluffing prevents permanent flat spots. Just pick up the chair and gently toss it around. You can also knead the chair with your hands. Do this a few times a week, especially if it gets daily use.

Keep your Big Joe chair clean. Spot clean spills immediately. Use a damp cloth and mild soap for most surface messes. Many Big Joe covers are made from durable, easy-to-clean fabrics. However, regular cleaning prevents stains from setting in. Avoid harsh chemicals. These can damage the fabric. If you need a more thorough clean, remember you can remove the cover after opening the chair. Some general cleaning tips for bean bags apply. For example, you can learn how to clean bean bags without removing beans for minor spills. [how do you clean bean bags without removing beans](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-do-you-clean-bean-bags-without-removing-beans).

Protect your chair from direct sunlight. Prolonged exposure to sun can fade the fabric. It can also degrade the filling material over time. Place your chair away from windows or use curtains during peak sun hours. If you use your Big Joe outdoors, bring it inside when not in use. Store it in a dry place. This prevents moisture buildup. Moisture can lead to mold or mildew. Proper storage protects both the cover and the internal beans. Following these tips will help your Big Joe chair remain a comfy spot in your home for a long time.

## FAQ Section

### Why is my Big Joe zipper so hard to open?
Big Joe bean bag chairs have child-safe zippers without standard pull tabs. This makes them intentionally hard to open to prevent accidental access by children. You need to use a straightened paperclip inserted into the small hole on the zipper slider to create a temporary pull. This allows you to slide the zipper open with more control.

### Can I wash my Big Joe bean bag cover?
Most Big Joe bean bag covers are removable and machine washable. Always check the care tag on your specific chair cover for exact instructions. Typically, you should wash it on a gentle cycle with cold water and mild detergent. Ensure the cover is completely dry before putting it back on the inner liner.

### What kind of filling should I use for my Big Joe chair?
Big Joe recommends using their proprietary UltimaX beans for refilling. These are specific types of EPS (expanded polystyrene) beads designed for Big Joe chairs. Using other types of filling might change the chair's feel. It could also void any warranty. UltimaX beans offer the best comfort and longevity.

### How often should I refill my Big Joe bean bag chair?
The frequency of refilling depends on how often you use your chair. With daily use, the beans might compress and flatten faster. Most people find they need to add more filling every 6 months to 2 years. If your chair feels less plump or supportive, it is time for a refill.

### Is it safe to leave the inner liner open while refilling?
It is not recommended to leave the inner liner wide open. When refilling, it is best to use a large funnel placed securely into the inner liner's opening. This helps contain the beans and prevents spills. Always close the inner liner zipper tightly once you finish refilling. Then, close the outer cover zipper.

### Can I use a different tool instead of a paperclip to open the zipper?
You can use any thin, sturdy object that fits into the small hole on the zipper slider. A small unbent bobby pin or a thin piece of wire could work. The key is that the object needs to be strong enough to pull the zipper without breaking or bending. A paperclip is commonly recommended because it is readily available and effective.
