### Types of RV Refrigerators

RV refrigerators come in two main types. Absorption refrigerators use heat to cool. They run on propane, electricity, or both. These are common in older RVs. They need proper leveling to work well. Compression refrigerators work like home fridges. They run on 12V DC or 120V AC power. They are more efficient and cool faster.

Each type has unique installation requirements. Absorption units need roof vents for heat dissipation. Compression units are less sensitive to leveling. Choose a refrigerator that fits your RV's existing space and power setup. Make sure the new unit matches the dimensions of your old one. This simplifies the RV refrigerator replacement process greatly.

## Gathering Essential Tools and Supplies for RV Fridge Swap

Before you start any work, gather all necessary items. This prevents delays and improves safety. I always create a checklist of tools and parts. This ensures I have everything on hand before beginning the RV refrigerator replacement. Proper preparation makes the job smoother.

### Essential Tools for Removal and Installation

You will need a basic set of hand tools. A screwdriver set, including Phillips and flathead, is important. Pliers are useful for various connections. An adjustable wrench or socket set helps with nuts and bolts. A utility knife cuts sealants or insulation. A measuring tape ensures your new fridge fits.

Other helpful tools include a drill with various bits. A small pry bar assists with stubborn components. A level helps ensure the new fridge sits correctly. Having these tools ready saves time. It also prevents frustration during the process.

Safety gear is paramount. Wear work gloves to protect your hands. Safety glasses shield your eyes from debris. You will need new propane fittings if your fridge uses gas. Thread sealant ensures gas connections are leak-free. Electrical connectors, like wire nuts or crimp connectors, are also necessary.

Butyl tape or sealant forms a waterproof seal around the new unit. This prevents water intrusion. You might need insulation foam if your new fridge is smaller. New screws or fasteners may be required. Check your new RV refrigerator's manual for specific recommendations. Having these supplies ready simplifies the RV fridge swap.

## Safety First: Disconnecting Your Old RV Refrigerator

Safety is the top priority when working with RV appliances. Electricity and propane gas pose serious risks. My first step in any RV repair is always to ensure all power sources are off. This prevents accidents during the RV refrigerator replacement.

### Disconnecting Electrical Power

Before touching any wires, turn off all power. First, disconnect your RV from shore power. This means unplugging the main power cord. Next, turn off the 120V AC breaker for the refrigerator. This is usually found in your RV's power distribution panel. Finally, disconnect the 12V DC power. This involves turning off the battery disconnect switch or removing the battery terminals.

Always use a voltage tester to confirm no power is present. Touch the probes to the wires you plan to disconnect. A zero reading confirms the circuit is dead. This step prevents electric shock. Do not skip this check.

### Shutting Off Propane Gas Supply

Working with propane gas requires extreme caution. First, turn off the main propane valve at the tank. This stops gas flow to all RV appliances. Next, disconnect the propane line directly at the refrigerator. Use two wrenches for this. One wrench holds the fitting on the fridge, and the other loosens the gas line nut. This prevents twisting or damaging the refrigerator's gas valve.

A small amount of gas may escape as you disconnect the line. This is normal. Work in a well-ventilated area. After disconnection, cap the propane line. This prevents accidental gas leaks. You want to ensure the safety of everyone around.

## Removing the Old RV Refrigerator: Step-by-Step

Once power and gas are off, you can remove the old unit. This process varies slightly by RV model and refrigerator type. However, the general steps remain consistent. I find it helps to have a helper for this part. RV refrigerators are heavy and awkward to move alone.

### Accessing Fasteners and Vents

RV refrigerators are typically secured in several places. Look inside the refrigerator for screws. These often hide under plastic caps or trim pieces. They fasten the fridge to the cabinet. Check the exterior access panel. There might be screws or brackets holding the fridge in place there too. Some older units may have screws along the front flange.

If your RV refrigerator is an absorption model, it will have an exterior vent panel. Remove this panel to access the rear components. This includes the burner, cooling unit, and gas line. You will also find electrical connections here. Removing this panel provides crucial access.

### Disconnecting and Sliding Out the Unit

With all fasteners removed, gently pull the refrigerator forward. This might require some wiggling. Be careful not to damage the cabinet. Disconnect any remaining wires or gas lines if you haven't already. Label wires if they are not color-coded. This helps with reconnection.

Some RV refrigerators have external drain tubes. Disconnect these as well. Once all connections are free, slide the old unit out of its opening. This can be tricky due to weight. Use a moving dolly or furniture sliders if available. Place old towels or cardboard on the floor to prevent scratches. Take your time to avoid injury or damage. Knowing how the cooling unit works helps understand the system: [How to replace RV refrigerator heating element](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-rv-refrigerator-heating-element).

## Preparing the RV Opening for Your New Refrigerator

With the old unit out, you have an empty space. This is a good time to prepare the area for the new RV refrigerator. Proper preparation ensures a good fit and proper function. I always make sure the area is spotless.

### Cleaning and Inspecting the Cavity

Thoroughly clean the entire cavity. Remove any dust, debris, or old sealant. Use a cleaner to remove grease or stains. Inspect the floor and walls for damage. Look for signs of water intrusion or mold. Address any issues before installing the new unit. This prevents future problems.

Check the insulation within the cavity. Ensure it is intact and free of damage. Good insulation helps the new refrigerator operate efficiently. If you find gaps, consider adding insulation. This improves cooling performance and reduces energy consumption.

### Checking Dimensions and Ventilation

Measure the opening carefully. Compare these measurements to your new RV refrigerator's dimensions. Ensure the new fridge fits both in width, height, and depth. Pay attention to minimum clearance requirements specified by the manufacturer. Adequate space around the unit is important for proper ventilation.

For absorption refrigerators, check the roof vent. Ensure it is clear of obstructions. The vent allows hot air to escape. Poor ventilation makes the fridge work harder. Sometimes, replacing the vent base is necessary if it's old or damaged: [How to replace RV refrigerator roof vent base](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-replace-rv-refrigerator-roof-vent-base).

## Installing Your New RV Refrigerator: The Connection Process

Installing the new RV refrigerator is essentially the reverse of removal. Careful attention to connections is crucial for safety and function. This step makes your RV refrigerator replacement complete.

### Sliding and Securing the New Unit

Carefully slide the new RV refrigerator into the prepared opening. Take care not to pinch wires or gas lines. Ensure the unit is centered and level. Use shims if needed to achieve a perfectly level position. This is especially important for absorption refrigerators. A level unit operates more efficiently.

Once in place, secure the refrigerator. Use the manufacturer's recommended screws or brackets. These usually go through the interior cabinet framing. Check for tight fit and stability. The refrigerator should not wobble or shift.

### Reconnecting Electrical and Propane Lines

Begin with electrical connections. Match the wires correctly: 12V DC positive, negative, and 120V AC hot, neutral, ground. Use appropriate connectors. Ensure all connections are tight and secure. Double-check your wiring against the new refrigerator's manual. Incorrect wiring can damage the unit or create a fire hazard. Some RV refrigerators can run on electric only: [Can I run my RV refrigerator on electric only?](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-run-my-rv-refrigerator-on-electric-only).

Next, reconnect the propane gas line. Apply thread sealant to the fittings. Tighten connections firmly with two wrenches. Do not overtighten, as this can strip threads. After connecting, perform a leak test. Spray a soap and water solution on all gas connections. Bubbles indicate a leak. Tighten the connection until no bubbles appear. Repeat this test before turning on the gas.

## Testing and Finalizing Your RV Refrigerator Installation

After installation, thorough testing is necessary. This ensures everything works correctly and safely. A complete check prevents issues down the road. This is the final step in your RV refrigerator replacement.

### Initial Power-Up and Leak Detection
