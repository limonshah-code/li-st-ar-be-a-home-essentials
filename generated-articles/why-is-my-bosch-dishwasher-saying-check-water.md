## Fixing Your Bosch Dishwasher's 'Check Water' Message

Picture this: You have just loaded your Bosch dishwasher, pressed start, and instead of hearing the familiar hum of washing, you see an unsettling message: "Check Water." This alert can stop your dishwashing routine. It often appears when the dishwasher does not detect enough water entering the tub, or senses a problem with water circulation. I understand how frustrating this can be.

Many Bosch dishwasher owners face this exact problem. The "Check Water" message indicates an issue with the water supply or its internal components. Understanding the root cause helps you fix it fast. This comprehensive guide helps you understand why your Bosch dishwasher is saying "Check Water." We will explore common culprits, from simple water supply issues to more complex internal failures. We also provide clear, actionable steps to troubleshoot and resolve this common dishwasher error. Let's get your Bosch dishwasher back to sparkling clean dishes.

### Takeaway

If your Bosch dishwasher says "Check Water," check these areas first:
*   **Water Supply:** Ensure the water valve is fully open and water pressure is good.
*   **Inlet Filter & Hose:** Inspect for kinks or clogs.
*   **Inlet Valve:** Test if the valve itself is faulty.
*   **Sump & Float Switch:** Clean debris and check the float's movement.
*   **AquaStop System:** Look for leaks that might trigger this safety feature.
*   **Drain System:** Verify no blockages are preventing proper draining, which can affect filling.

Your Bosch dishwasher says "Check Water" usually because it cannot get enough water or detects a problem with water intake. This happens due to low water pressure, a closed water valve, a clogged inlet filter, a faulty water inlet valve, or issues with the AquaStop flood protection system. Addressing these areas helps clear the error.

## Understanding the 'Check Water' Error on Your Bosch Dishwasher

When your Bosch dishwasher displays "Check Water," it signals a problem with its water intake system. This message means the appliance did not receive the expected amount of water within a set time. Alternatively, it might indicate that the internal water level sensor did not detect water. This stops the wash cycle to prevent damage or improper operation. It is a safety measure built into your appliance.

Understanding this error is the first step toward a solution. The dishwasher's control board monitors water flow and levels. If these do not meet specified parameters, the "Check Water" message appears. This system protects the dishwasher and your home from potential water damage. It also ensures efficient cleaning. Do not ignore this alert.

Initial troubleshooting can save you time and money. Before calling a technician, you can check a few simple things. Start by ensuring the water supply to your home is on. Then, look at the specific connection to your dishwasher. Sometimes, the fix is much simpler than it seems.

Here are some common reasons this error appears:
*   **Insufficient Water Supply:** The dishwasher does not get enough water pressure or volume.
*   **Blocked Inlet Components:** Filters or hoses are clogged, preventing water flow.
*   **Component Failure:** Parts like the water inlet valve or float switch are faulty.
*   **Safety System Activation:** The AquaStop system detects a potential leak.

Addressing these areas step-by-step helps pinpoint the exact cause. Many issues you can fix yourself. If your Bosch dishwasher is not filling with water, it will definitely show this error. Checking the basics first often solves the problem.

## Diagnosing Low Water Pressure and Supply Issues

One common reason your Bosch dishwasher says "Check Water" is insufficient water supply or low water pressure. The dishwasher needs a certain amount of water flowing at a specific pressure to operate correctly. If the pressure is too low, the dishwasher cannot fill fast enough. This triggers the "Check Water" error message. It is important to confirm your water supply is strong.

Start by checking the main water valve leading to your house. Ensure it is fully open. Then, locate the shut-off valve for the dishwasher itself. This valve is usually under the sink or behind the dishwasher. Make sure this valve is also completely open. A partially closed valve can restrict water flow significantly. Sometimes, the valve gets bumped or accidentally closed.

You can test your home's water pressure easily. Turn on a nearby faucet, like your kitchen sink, to full hot. Observe the water flow. Is it strong and steady, or does it trickle out? If the flow is weak at the sink, your entire home might have low water pressure. This can stem from municipal supply issues, problems with your well pump, or blockages in your home's main water lines. If other appliances struggle with water, call a plumber.

Additionally, check the water supply line connected to the dishwasher. Look for any kinks, bends, or damage in the hose. A kinked hose restricts water flow just as effectively as a closed valve. Straighten any kinks you find. If the hose looks old or damaged, consider replacing it. A healthy water connection is vital for your dishwasher to function. You might want to consider how your Bosch dishwasher connects to hot water, as that specific line can also have issues. Ensuring proper water pressure is a fundamental step in troubleshooting this error.

## Inspecting and Cleaning the Water Inlet Filter and Hose

After checking water pressure, the next step is to examine the water inlet filter and hose. A clogged filter is a very common reason for a Bosch dishwasher saying "Check Water." Sediment, mineral deposits, or debris from your water supply can accumulate in this filter. This buildup restricts water flow into the dishwasher. The dishwasher then cannot fill properly.

The water inlet hose connects your dishwasher to the household water supply. First, turn off the water supply to the dishwasher. You can typically do this using the shut-off valve under your sink. Then, disconnect the water supply hose from the back of the dishwasher. Be ready with a towel, as some water might spill out.

Once disconnected, inspect the hose itself. Run water through it into a bucket to check for good flow. Look for any visible debris inside the hose. Next, locate the small filter screen at the end of the water inlet hose where it connects to the dishwasher's inlet valve. This mesh screen is designed to catch particles before they enter the dishwasher. It prevents damage to internal components.

Carefully remove this filter screen. You might need a pair of needle-nose pliers or tweezers for this. Rinse the filter under running water to remove any accumulated debris. If the screen is heavily clogged, you might need a small brush to clean it thoroughly. Make sure all holes are clear. Reinstall the clean filter and reattach the water supply hose securely. Turn the water supply back on and check for leaks before running a test cycle. If your dishwasher filter is full of water even when it shouldn't be, this could also point to blockages preventing proper flow into or out of the system.

## Testing and Replacing a Faulty Water Inlet Valve

If water pressure and filter checks do not resolve the "Check Water" error, a faulty water inlet valve might be the problem. The water inlet valve is an electrically operated device. It opens to allow water into the dishwasher tub. When it fails, it either does not open fully or does not open at all. This prevents proper filling, leading to the error message.

You can often hear the water inlet valve working during the fill cycle. It makes a distinct buzzing sound as it opens. If you hear no sound or a faint click without water flow, the valve could be bad. Before testing, disconnect the dishwasher from power for safety. Turn off the water supply to the dishwasher at the shut-off valve.

Locate the water inlet valve. It is usually at the bottom front of the dishwasher, behind the kick panel. The water supply hose connects directly to it. You will see electrical wires attached to the valve's solenoids. These solenoids control the valve's opening and closing. You can test the valve for continuity using a multimeter. Set the multimeter to the ohms (Î©) setting. Disconnect the wires from the solenoids. Touch the multimeter probes to the terminals of each solenoid. A good valve typically shows a resistance reading between 500 and 1,500 ohms. No reading, or a reading outside this range, indicates a faulty solenoid. This means the valve needs replacement.

Replacing the water inlet valve involves disconnecting the water line and electrical connections. Then, you remove the old valve and install a new one. Ensure all connections are secure to prevent leaks. This task requires some comfort with appliance repair. If you are unsure, it is best to call a professional. Learning how to test a Bosch dishwasher water inlet valve can save you money and pinpoint the problem efficiently.

## Addressing Sump Area Blockages and Float Switch Problems

Sometimes, the "Check Water" error on your Bosch dishwasher points to issues within the sump area. The sump is the basin at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It collects water during the wash and rinse cycles. The water level sensor or float switch is also located in this area. This sensor monitors the water level inside the tub. If the sump is blocked or the float switch is stuck, the dishwasher might not detect water properly. This triggers the "Check Water" error.

Debris like food particles, broken glass, or even small utensils can accumulate in the sump. This prevents water from entering or leaving the system correctly. It can also interfere with the float switch's movement. The float switch is a safety device. It rises with the water level. If it gets stuck in the "empty" position, the dishwasher will try to fill indefinitely. If it gets stuck in the "full" position, it can signal an overfill. This may also trigger the "Check Water" or similar errors.

To inspect the sump, first, remove the bottom dish rack. Then, remove the spray arm. You will see a filter assembly in the center of the sump. Carefully remove this filter assembly according to your Bosch dishwasher manual. Check for any food debris, grease, or other obstructions. Clean the filter under running water. Use a soft brush if necessary. Once the filter is clean, you can see the float switch. It is usually a small plastic cap or lever. Push it up and down manually to ensure it moves freely without sticking. If it feels stiff, gently clean around its base.

Reassemble the filter and spray arm. Ensure everything is correctly seated. A clean sump and a freely moving float switch help your dishwasher correctly sense water levels. This prevents the "Check Water" message. If your Bosch dishwasher has water in the bottom even when empty, or if it keeps filling up with water, a faulty float switch or blockages are very likely the cause. Addressing these problems is crucial for correct operation.

## Troubleshooting the Bosch AquaStop System

Bosch dishwashers often feature an advanced flood protection system called AquaStop. This system is designed to prevent water leaks. If AquaStop activates, it will stop the water supply to the dishwasher. This often results in the "Check Water" error message. The system includes a double-walled inlet hose and a sensor at the base of the dishwasher. If a leak occurs, the sensor detects water in the base pan. It then automatically shuts off the water flow.

The AquaStop system is very sensitive. Even a small leak can trigger it. Common causes for AquaStop activation include:
*   **Leaks from the Tub Seal:** Worn or damaged door seals can allow water to escape.
*   **Hose Connections:** Loose or damaged water supply or drain hose connections can leak.
*   **Pump Leaks:** The circulation pump or drain pump might develop a leak.
*   **Internal Component Leaks:** Any internal component that carries water, like a heater or manifold, can leak.

When AquaStop activates, you might see water in the base pan under the dishwasher. To check this, you usually need to remove the kick panel at the bottom front of the dishwasher. Use a flashlight to look for standing water. If water is present, the AquaStop system is working as intended. You need to find the source of the leak.

Once you find and fix the leak, you may need to dry out the base pan completely. Use towels or a wet-dry vacuum to remove all water. Sometimes, simply tilting the dishwasher forward slightly can drain the water. However, I recommend carefully removing the base panel for thorough drying. After the base pan is dry, the AquaStop system should reset itself. You can then try to run the dishwasher again. If the leak persists or the AquaStop error keeps appearing, professional help is necessary. The presence of water in the bottom of your Bosch dishwasher is a strong indicator that AquaStop has been activated due to a leak.

## Ensuring Proper Drainage for Water Flow

While the "Check Water" error primarily relates to water intake, issues with the drainage system can indirectly cause it. If the dishwasher cannot drain properly, residual water can stay in the tub. This might trick the water level sensor into thinking the tub is already full. The dishwasher then prevents new water from entering, leading to the "Check Water" message. This happens because the appliance logic dictates it should not add more water if previous water is still present.

Several components can cause drainage problems:
*   **Clogged Drain Filter:** Food debris and particles often accumulate in the drain filter at the bottom of the tub. This blocks water flow to the drain pump. Regular cleaning of this filter is essential.
*   **Kinked or Clogged Drain Hose:** The drain hose connects the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. Kinks in the hose restrict flow. Internal clogs from food particles or grease also block it. Disconnect the hose and clear any obstructions.
*   **Garbage Disposal Connection:** If your dishwasher drains into a garbage disposal, ensure the disposal's knockout plug is removed. If it is new or recently installed, this plug might still be in place. Also, run your disposal regularly to prevent food accumulation in the drain line.
*   **Air Gap Clog:** Some plumbing setups include an air gap on the sink. This device prevents dirty drain water from flowing back into the dishwasher. Air gaps can get clogged with food debris. Clean the air gap to ensure proper drainage.

To troubleshoot drainage, first, ensure the main drain filter inside the dishwasher tub is clean. Next, visually inspect the drain hose for kinks. If accessible, disconnect the drain hose from both the dishwasher and the sink drain. Clear any blockages you find. You can use a long brush or a plumbing snake for stubborn clogs. After ensuring the drainage path is clear, run a test cycle. Proper drainage ensures that the dishwasher starts each cycle with an empty tub, allowing for correct water intake and preventing the "Check Water" error. If your Bosch dishwasher has water in the bottom, drainage issues are a likely culprit.
