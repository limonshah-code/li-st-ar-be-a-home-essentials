## What Your Frigidaire Refrigerator Warranty Covers

## Maintaining Your Frigidaire Refrigerator to Preserve Warranty

Proper maintenance is crucial for your Frigidaire refrigerator. It helps keep the appliance running well. It also helps you preserve your warranty coverage. Most manufacturer warranties require basic care. Neglecting maintenance could void your warranty. Frigidaire expects you to use the appliance as intended. They also expect you to keep it in good condition.

Simple tasks can make a big difference. Clean the condenser coils regularly. Dust and pet hair can build up on these coils. This forces the compressor to work harder. This increases energy use and can cause parts to fail. Use a vacuum cleaner to remove dust. Ensure proper ventilation around the refrigerator. Do not block the vents.

Keep the door seals clean and in good repair. Damaged seals let cold air escape. This makes the refrigerator run more. Check the seals for cracks or tears. Clean the interior regularly to prevent odors and mold. Following the care instructions in your owner's manual is key. This routine care extends your refrigerator's life. It also ensures your Frigidaire refrigerator warranty remains valid.

## Key Factors Affecting Your Frigidaire Refrigerator Warranty

Several factors can impact your Frigidaire refrigerator warranty. Understanding these elements is important. They determine if your repair will be covered.

*   **Purchase Date:** The warranty period starts from your purchase date. Keep your sales receipt as proof. Without it, verifying coverage is difficult.
*   **Model and Serial Number:** Each refrigerator model has specific warranty terms. The serial number identifies your unique unit. These numbers are vital for warranty claims.
*   **Original Owner:** Most Frigidaire warranties apply to the original purchaser. If you buy a used refrigerator, the warranty may not transfer.
*   **Installation:** Improper installation can void your warranty. Always follow the installation instructions carefully. Consider professional installation.
*   **Use Environment:** Using a residential refrigerator in a commercial setting typically voids the warranty. Warranties are usually specific to home use.
*   **Authorized Service:** Only use Frigidaire-authorized technicians for repairs. Unauthorized repairs void the warranty. This is a common pitfall.
*   **Modifications:** Making modifications to the appliance can void coverage. Do not alter parts or systems.
*   **Acts of God/External Causes:** Damage from floods, fires, or power surges is not covered. Your home insurance might cover these events.
