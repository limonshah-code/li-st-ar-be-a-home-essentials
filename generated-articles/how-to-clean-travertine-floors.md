## Restore Your Travertine Floors: A Simple Cleaning Guide

Travertine floors bring a unique elegance to any home. Their natural beauty, with warm tones and distinct patterns, creates a timeless appeal. However, as with any natural stone, keeping travertine floors pristine requires specific care. You need to understand their porous nature and how different cleaning agents can affect them.

Many common cleaning mistakes can damage travertine, leading to dullness or etch marks. I understand wanting to protect your investment and keep your floors looking new. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean travertine floors safely and effectively. We will cover daily maintenance, deep cleaning strategies, stain removal, and the importance of sealing. Let's make your travertine floors shine again.

### Takeaway

Keeping your travertine floors beautiful requires consistent, gentle care. Always use pH-neutral cleaners and soft tools. Promptly address spills and stains. Regular sealing protects your stone.

To effectively clean travertine floors, regularly sweep or vacuum to remove loose dirt. Mop with a pH-neutral, stone-specific cleaner and a soft cloth or mop. Immediately wipe up spills. For deeper cleaning, use a specialized stone cleaner and a soft-bristle brush, then rinse thoroughly and dry. Regularly seal the floors to prevent staining and etching.

## Understanding Travertine: A Foundation for Proper Cleaning

Before we dive into how to clean travertine floors, it is important to understand what travertine is. Travertine is a form of limestone, a natural stone created by mineral deposits from hot springs. This formation process gives it its distinct porous structure and beautiful, earthy appearance. Travertine often features small holes and channels that are either left unfilled for a rustic look or filled with epoxy or cement for a smoother finish.

This porous nature makes travertine particularly sensitive to acidic substances. Cleaners containing harsh chemicals, vinegar, or citrus can etch or dull the stone's surface. This damage is often irreversible without professional intervention. Knowing this helps you choose the right cleaning products and methods. It also highlights why sealing your travertine is a crucial part of its maintenance. Proper care ensures the longevity and beauty of your flooring.

### The Different Finishes of Travertine Floors

Travertine floors come in several finishes, and each one affects how you should clean them. Knowing your floor's finish helps you choose the right tools and techniques. The four main types are honed, polished, tumbled, and brushed. Each offers a different look and feel, and each has unique cleaning considerations. Understanding these differences prevents damage and maintains the floor's aesthetic appeal.

#### Honed Travertine

Honed travertine has a matte or satin finish. It is smooth but not shiny. This finish is popular for its natural, understated look. Honed surfaces are more susceptible to staining because their pores are more open. When cleaning, you must be diligent about sealing and prompt spill cleanup. I find that a gentle approach with a soft mop works best here.

#### Polished Travertine

Polished travertine has a high-gloss, reflective surface. It undergoes a process that buffs the stone to a brilliant shine. This finish is less porous than honed, making it somewhat more resistant to stains. However, it shows scratches and etch marks more easily. You need to be very careful with abrasive cleaners or tools on polished surfaces. Maintaining its shine requires consistent, gentle cleaning and regular buffing.

#### Tumbled Travertine

Tumbled travertine has a rustic, antique appearance. Its edges are rounded and its surface is textured, with many visible holes. This finish is achieved by tumbling the stones in a drum with aggregate and water. Tumbled travertine is very porous and prone to collecting dirt in its many crevices. Cleaning requires careful attention to those textured areas. A soft brush can help dislodge dirt without damaging the stone.

#### Brushed Travertine

Brushed travertine has a textured, matte finish that highlights the stone's natural grain. Brushing uses wire brushes to create a worn, aged look. This finish is less smooth than honed but not as rough as tumbled. It offers good slip resistance. Dirt can settle into the textured surface, so thorough cleaning, especially with a soft-bristle brush, is important. Like all travertine, it benefits from regular sealing.

## Essential Tools and Cleaning Solutions for Travertine Floors

Having the right tools and solutions is key to cleaning travertine floors effectively and safely. Using incorrect products can damage this beautiful natural stone. You need specific items that cater to its porous and acid-sensitive nature. Investing in these essential supplies will protect your floors and make your cleaning routine much easier. Always check product labels to ensure they are safe for natural stone.

### Must-Have Cleaning Tools

Using the right tools ensures you clean your travertine floors without scratching or damaging them. Gentle tools are always the best choice for this delicate stone. Harsh brushes or abrasive pads can dull the finish or create visible marks. I always recommend having a specific set of tools for your stone floors.

*   **Soft-bristle broom or dust mop:** Use this daily to remove loose dirt and grit. This prevents particles from scratching the floor as you walk on it.
*   **Microfiber mop or soft cloth mop:** These mops are gentle on the stone surface and absorb liquid effectively. Avoid sponge mops, which can push dirt into the grout lines.
*   **Vacuum cleaner with a soft floor attachment:** A vacuum helps pick up fine dust and debris. Make sure the attachment has no beater bar or stiff bristles that could scratch the travertine.
*   **Clean buckets:** You will need two buckets: one for your cleaning solution and one for rinse water. This prevents spreading dirty water.
*   **Soft scrubbing brush (for grout):** A soft-bristle brush is useful for gently cleaning grout lines without damaging the adjacent stone. For more on grout, check out our guide on [how to clean tile grout on floors](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-tile-grout-on-floors).
*   **Absorbent towels or microfiber cloths:** Use these for drying the floor immediately after mopping to prevent water spots and ensure no moisture remains.

### Recommended Cleaning Solutions

The type of cleaner you use is critical for travertine floors. Acidic, alkaline, or abrasive cleaners will cause irreparable damage. Always opt for pH-neutral, stone-specific products. These solutions are formulated to clean without harming the stone's delicate composition. I have found that sticking to these types of cleaners makes a huge difference in the long-term health of my floors.

*   **pH-neutral stone cleaner:** This is the most important product you will buy. These cleaners are specifically designed for natural stone and will not etch or damage your travertine. Brands like StoneTech, DuPont, and Miracle Sealants offer good options.
*   **Warm water:** Warm water helps dissolve dirt and allows the cleaning solution to work more effectively.
*   **Mild dish soap (very diluted, for emergencies only):** In a pinch, a tiny drop of mild, pH-neutral dish soap diluted in a large bucket of water can be used for spot cleaning. However, it can leave residue, so it is not recommended for regular use. Always rinse thoroughly if you use it.
*   **Hydrogen peroxide (for specific stains):** Diluted hydrogen peroxide can be effective for organic stains, but use it with extreme caution and test in an inconspicuous area first.

**Avoid at all costs:**
*   Vinegar, lemon juice, or any acidic cleaners
*   Bleach or ammonia-based cleaners
*   Abrasive powders or scouring pads
*   All-purpose cleaners not labeled as safe for natural stone

## Daily and Weekly Maintenance for Travertine Floors

Regular maintenance is the most effective way to keep your travertine floors looking great. It prevents dirt buildup and reduces the need for harsh deep cleaning. Daily and weekly routines are simple but essential steps in protecting your investment. By doing a little bit each day, you can maintain the natural beauty of your travertine. I have found that consistency is the real secret to keeping them pristine.

### Daily Cleaning Routine

Your daily cleaning routine focuses on removing loose debris that can scratch the surface. This simple step takes only a few minutes. It also helps keep your home cleaner overall. Make this a habit, especially in high-traffic areas.

*   **Sweep or dust mop:** Use a soft-bristle broom or a microfiber dust mop. Go over the entire floor to pick up dust, dirt, and pet hair. This prevents grit from grinding into the stone when walked upon.
*   **Wipe up spills immediately:** Travertine is porous, so spills, especially acidic ones like juice or wine, can quickly etch or stain the stone. Blot them up with a clean, soft cloth as soon as they happen. Rinse the area with plain water and dry thoroughly.

### Weekly Cleaning Routine

Weekly cleaning involves a gentle wet mop to remove accumulated dirt and grime. This step refreshes the floor's appearance without being overly aggressive. It is crucial to use the right cleaner and technique. This routine keeps your floors presentable between deeper cleaning sessions.

*   **Vacuum:** Use your vacuum cleaner with a soft floor attachment. This will pick up any fine dust that the broom might miss. Focus on corners and edges where dirt tends to accumulate.
*   **Prepare cleaning solution:** Fill one bucket with warm, clean water. In a second bucket, mix your pH-neutral stone cleaner according to the manufacturer's instructions.
*   **Mop the floor:** Dip your microfiber or soft cloth mop into the cleaning solution, wring it out thoroughly until it is just damp, not dripping wet. Mop the floor in small sections. Change the cleaning solution frequently if it becomes dirty. For tips on cleaning other types of tile, see our guide on [how to clean tile floors](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-tile-floors).
*   **Rinse the floor:** After mopping with the cleaner, rinse your mop head in the bucket of clean water. Wring it out again until it is damp. Mop the same section again with plain water to remove any cleaning solution residue. Repeat this rinsing process for all sections.
*   **Dry the floor:** Immediately dry the floor with clean, absorbent towels or another clean, dry mop head. Do not allow water to air dry on travertine, as it can leave water spots or mineral deposits. Ensuring the floor is completely dry is key to preventing streaks and water damage.

## Deep Cleaning Travertine Floors: Tackling Stubborn Dirt

Even with regular maintenance, travertine floors sometimes need a deeper clean. Over time, dirt can settle into the stone's pores or grout lines. Deep cleaning restores the floor's luster and removes stubborn grime that daily cleaning misses. This process is more intensive but crucial for preserving the beauty of your travertine. I usually plan for a deep clean every few months, or more often in high-traffic areas. For general deep cleaning techniques, you can also refer to our article on [how to deep clean floors](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-deep-clean-floors).

### Preparing for a Deep Clean

Preparation is vital for an effective and safe deep clean. Taking these steps ensures you get the best results without damaging your floor. It also makes the actual cleaning process smoother and more efficient. Do not skip these initial stages.

*   **Clear the area:** Move all furniture, rugs, and other items off the travertine floor. This gives you full access to the entire surface.
*   **Thoroughly sweep or vacuum:** Remove all loose dirt, dust, and debris. This prevents dirt from turning into muddy streaks during wet cleaning. Use your soft-bristle broom or a vacuum with a soft floor attachment.
*   **Inspect for specific stains or issues:** Look for any particular stains, etch marks, or areas that need extra attention. Addressing these before the main deep clean can be more effective.

### The Deep Cleaning Process

Deep cleaning travertine involves a more concentrated effort than routine mopping. It often requires a slightly stronger application of your pH-neutral cleaner and more deliberate scrubbing. Remember to work in manageable sections. Always prioritize gentleness to protect the stone.

1.  **Mix concentrated stone cleaner:** Follow your pH-neutral stone cleaner's instructions for deep cleaning ratios. Usually, this means a slightly higher concentration of cleaner to water.
2.  **Apply cleaner to a small section:** Pour the solution onto a small area of the floor, or apply it directly with your damp mop. Let the cleaner sit for 5-10 minutes. Do not let it dry on the floor. This dwell time allows the cleaner to penetrate and loosen embedded dirt.
3.  **Gently scrub the floor:** Use a soft-bristle brush, a non-abrasive scrub pad, or your microfiber mop to gently agitate the cleaner on the surface. Focus on grout lines and textured areas. Avoid scrubbing too aggressively, especially on polished finishes. For issues specifically with cleaning outdoor travertine, you might find tips in our guide on [how to clean outdoor travertine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-outdoor-travertine).
4.  **Remove dirty solution:** Use a wet/dry vacuum or a clean mop to pick up the dirty cleaning solution. Wring out the mop frequently into a separate bucket.
5.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Fill a clean bucket with plain warm water. Mop the section thoroughly with clean water, rinsing the mop frequently. This removes all cleaner residue. You may need to rinse multiple times to ensure no soap film remains.
6.  **Dry completely:** Immediately dry the section with clean, absorbent towels or a dry mop. Leaving water to air dry can lead to streaks or water spots. Move to the next section and repeat the process until the entire floor is clean.

## Expert Strategies for Removing Common Travertine Stains

Stains are an unfortunate reality with natural stone, especially porous travertine. Acting quickly is always the best defense. Different types of stains require specific approaches. Using the wrong method can worsen the stain or damage the stone. I have learned that patience and the right product are key when tackling these issues. For general dirty floors, refer to our guide on [how to clean dirty floors](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-dirty-floors).

### Organic Stains (Coffee, Tea, Food, Pet Urine)

Organic stains often leave a brownish or yellowish mark. They come from things like coffee, tea, food, or pet accidents. These stains usually respond well to oxidative cleaners. Always address pet urine quickly, as its acidity can also etch the stone.

*   **Method:** Create a paste using hydrogen peroxide (3% or 6%) mixed with a small amount of powdered poultice material (like diatomaceous earth or unbleached flour). Apply the paste thickly over the stain, cover with plastic wrap, and tape the edges down. Let it sit for 24-48 hours. The poultice draws the stain out.
*   **After:** Scrape off the dried paste with a plastic scraper. Rinse the area with plain water and dry. Repeat if necessary.

### Oil-Based Stains (Grease, Cooking Oil, Lotion)

Oil-based stains create a dark, often greasy mark on the stone. These stains require a different type of poultice that can absorb the oil. Speed is important here, too, as oil can spread through the stone's pores.

*   **Method:** Mix a liquid absorbent (like acetone or mineral spirits) with powdered poultice material to create a thick paste. Apply it to the stain, cover, and seal as with organic stains. Let it sit for 24-48 hours.
*   **After:** Remove the dried poultice, rinse, and dry. You may need to repeat the process. Ensure good ventilation when using solvents.

### Rust Stains

Rust stains often appear as orange or brown spots, typically from metal objects left on the floor. These are particularly stubborn and require a specialized rust remover designed for natural stone. Do not use generic rust removers, as they are often acidic.

*   **Method:** Purchase a rust remover specifically formulated for natural stone (check labels for "safe for travertine" or "safe for marble/limestone"). Follow the product instructions carefully. Apply to the stain, allow it to work, then rinse and dry.
*   **Caution:** Always test in an inconspicuous area first. Some rust removers can alter the stone's color if not used correctly.

### Etch Marks (from Acidic Spills)

Etch marks are not stains; they are physical damage to the stone's surface caused by acidic substances (like vinegar, citrus juice, or certain cleaners) dissolving the calcium carbonate in the travertine. They appear as dull spots or rough patches. For general stone cleaning, our guide on [how to clean stone](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-stone) is helpful.

*   **Method:** For minor etching on honed travertine, sometimes a very fine abrasive pad (like a polishing pad for stone) used with water can gently buff out the dullness. For polished travertine, professional re-polishing is usually required.
*   **Important:** Etch marks often cannot be cleaned away. They require professional restoration, such as re-honing or re-polishing. Prevention is always better than cure for etching.

## Sealing Your Travertine Floors: The Ultimate Protection

Sealing is arguably the most crucial step in caring for travertine floors. Because travertine is naturally porous, it can easily absorb spills and stains. A high-quality sealer penetrates the stone, creating an invisible barrier that repels liquids. This barrier gives you more time to clean up spills before they penetrate and cause damage. Think of it as a clear shield for your beautiful floor. I always emphasize this step because it saves so much trouble down the line.

### Why Sealing is Crucial

Sealing your travertine floors offers several key benefits:

*   **Stain Resistance:** It significantly reduces the stone's absorbency, making it far less prone to staining from liquids like coffee, wine, or oil.
*   **Etch Protection (Limited):** While sealers do not make travertine acid-proof, they can offer a small degree of protection against minor acidic spills, giving you crucial time to wipe them away before etching occurs.
*   **Easier Cleaning:** Sealed floors are easier to clean because dirt and grime sit on the surface rather than being absorbed into the pores.
*   **Preserves Appearance:** Regular sealing helps maintain the stone's natural color and finish, preventing it from looking dull or worn over time.

### How Often to Seal Travertine Floors

The frequency of sealing depends on several factors:

*   **Traffic:** High-traffic areas (kitchens, entryways) will need sealing more often than low-traffic areas (bedrooms).
*   **Type of Sealer:** Penetrating sealers, which are recommended for travertine, can last anywhere from 1 to 5 years.
*   **Usage:** Floors in wet areas, like bathrooms or around a [travertine shower](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-travertine-shower), may need more frequent sealing.
*   **Porosity of the Stone:** Some travertine types are more porous than others, requiring more frequent application.

**Rule of Thumb:** Test your sealer's effectiveness every 6-12 months. Place a few drops of water on the clean, dry floor in an inconspicuous spot. If the water beads up on the surface, the sealer is still working. If it soaks in and darkens the stone within a few minutes, it is time to reseal.

### The Sealing Process

Applying a sealer is a straightforward process, but careful preparation and application are essential for best results.

1.  **Thorough Cleaning:** The floor must be impeccably clean and completely dry before sealing. Any dirt or moisture trapped under the sealer will be sealed in. Perform a deep clean as described earlier and allow the floor to dry for at least 24-48 hours.
2.  **Choose the Right Sealer:** Select a high-quality, penetrating, impregnating sealer specifically designed for natural stone, especially for travertine or limestone. Avoid topical sealers that sit on the surface and can peel or yellow.
3.  **Apply the Sealer:**
    *   **Test Area:** Always test the sealer in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it does not alter the stone's appearance.
    *   **Application:** Apply the sealer evenly using a lamb's wool applicator, a paint roller with a short nap, or a clean cloth. Work in small sections to ensure even coverage. Do not overapply; a thin, even coat is better.
    *   **Dwell Time:** Allow the sealer to penetrate for the time recommended by the manufacturer (usually 10-20 minutes).
    *   **Wipe Off Excess:** This step is crucial. Before the sealer dries on the surface, wipe off all excess product with a clean, dry cloth. Leaving excess sealer on the surface can result in a hazy film that is difficult to remove.
    *   **Second Coat (Optional):** Many manufacturers recommend a second coat for optimal protection. Apply the second coat after the first has dried according to instructions (typically 1-3 hours). Wipe off excess again.
4.  **Curing Time:** Allow the sealer to cure fully before resuming normal traffic or placing rugs back. This can take anywhere from 24 to 72 hours, depending on the product and humidity.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes When Cleaning Travertine

Cleaning travertine floors incorrectly can cause significant, sometimes irreversible damage. Many common household cleaners and methods are simply not suitable for this delicate natural stone. Understanding these pitfalls will help you protect your investment and keep your floors beautiful for years to come. I have seen firsthand the damage that incorrect cleaning can cause.

### Using Acidic or Alkaline Cleaners

This is the biggest mistake you can make. Travertine is calcium-based, meaning it reacts with acids.

*   **Problem:** Products like vinegar, lemon juice, bleach, ammonia, and many generic bathroom cleaners are highly acidic or alkaline. They will etch the stone, leaving dull spots, discoloration, and rough patches. This is a chemical burn, not a stain.
*   **Solution:** Stick exclusively to pH-neutral cleaners specifically labeled for natural stone. Always check the label before use.

### Using Abrasive Tools or Cleaners

Abrasive materials can scratch and dull the surface of your travertine.

*   **Problem:** Scrub brushes with stiff bristles, scouring pads, steel wool, or abrasive cleaning powders will scratch the stone, especially polished finishes. These scratches accumulate, making the floor look dull and worn.
*   **Solution:** Use only soft-bristle brushes, microfiber mops, soft cloths, and non-abrasive pads. When vacuuming, ensure your vacuum has a soft floor attachment with no beater bar.

### Allowing Water to Stand or Air Dry

Water, especially hard water, can leave mineral deposits on your travertine.

*   **Problem:** If you let water air dry on your floors after mopping, it can leave behind unsightly water spots, streaks, or mineral deposits. In extreme cases, prolonged standing water can penetrate unsealed stone, causing water damage or discoloration.
*   **Solution:** Always dry your travertine floors immediately after mopping or rinsing. Use clean, absorbent towels or a dry mop.

### Not Sealing Your Travertine Floors

Neglecting to seal your floors leaves them vulnerable to spills and stains.

*   **Problem:** Unsealed or poorly sealed travertine is highly porous. Liquids, dirt, and stains can quickly penetrate the stone, leading to permanent discoloration or deep-seated grime that is impossible to clean.
*   **Solution:** Regularly test your sealer and reapply it as needed. Sealing is your primary defense against most types of damage and makes routine cleaning much easier.

### Using Too Much Cleaner or Not Rinsing Properly

Leaving cleaning residue on the floor can attract more dirt and dull the finish.

*   **Problem:** Over-saturating the floor with cleaning solution or not rinsing thoroughly enough leaves a sticky film. This residue attracts dirt, makes the floor look dull, and can even become slippery.
*   **Solution:** Follow the cleaner's dilution instructions carefully. Always rinse the floor thoroughly with plain water after cleaning, and dry immediately. Use a two-bucket system (one for cleaning solution, one for rinse water) to ensure you are rinsing with clean water.

### Delaying Spill Cleanup

Quick action is essential when spills occur on travertine.

*   **Problem:** The longer a spill sits on travertine, especially acidic or colored liquids, the more likely it is to stain or etch the stone.
*   **Solution:** Always blot up spills immediately with a clean, dry cloth. Rinse the area with plain water and dry. Act fast to prevent permanent damage. For specific advice on cleaning similar materials, see our article on [how to clean travertine tile](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-travertine-tile).

## Professional Travertine Care: When to Call the Experts

While regular DIY cleaning and maintenance are crucial, there are times when your travertine floors might need professional attention. Certain issues are beyond the scope of home care products and techniques. Knowing when to call in the experts can save your floors from irreversible damage and restore their original beauty. I view professional intervention as a wise investment for maintaining travertine's long-term value.

### When to Consider Professional Help

*   **Deep-Seated Stains:** If you have persistent stains that do not respond to your poulticing efforts, a professional can use specialized equipment and stronger, yet safe, chemicals to extract them. They have access to commercial-grade poultices and stain removers.
*   **Etching and Dullness:** Acid etching or widespread dullness that cannot be buffed out by hand requires professional restoration. Experts can re-hone or re-polish the stone using diamond abrasives to restore its uniform finish and shine.
*   **Pitting and Chips:** Over time, travertine's natural pores can enlarge, or small chips can occur. Professionals can fill these holes and repair minor damage using color-matched epoxy or grout, blending seamlessly with the existing stone.
*   **Uneven Surfaces:** If your travertine tiles have settled unevenly or there are lippage issues (where one tile edge is higher than the adjacent one), a professional stone polisher can grind and polish the surface to create a perfectly flat plane.
*   **Grout Restoration:** Beyond simple cleaning, if your grout is severely discolored, cracked, or deteriorating, professionals can re-grout or re-color grout lines for a refreshed look. For general tile grout, check [how to clean tile grout on floors](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-tile-grout-on-floors).
*   **Deep Cleaning and Sealing:** While you can do this yourself, professional deep cleaning services use powerful, truck-mounted equipment that can extract more dirt and rinse more thoroughly than home equipment. They also apply commercial-grade sealers for long-lasting protection. This is especially useful for [travertine pavers](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-travertine-pavers) or a [travertine pool deck](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-travertine-pool-deck) where deep cleaning is harder for DIY.

### What Professionals Can Do

Professional stone restoration companies employ technicians trained in the unique properties of natural stone. They use specialized tools and techniques:

*   **Diamond Grinding and Honing:** To remove deep scratches, etch marks, and create a uniform matte finish.
*   **Polishing:** Using finer diamond abrasives and polishing compounds to achieve a reflective, high-gloss shine.
*   **Grout Cleaning and Sealing:** Advanced tools to deep clean grout and apply durable grout sealers.
*   **Impregnating Sealing:** Applying high-quality, long-lasting impregnating sealers that penetrate deeply into the stone for maximum protection.
*   **Poulticing and Stain Removal:** Expertise in identifying stain types and applying the most effective poultice or chemical treatment.

Hiring a professional for these tasks every few years can significantly extend the life and beauty of your travertine floors. It protects your significant investment and ensures your floors always look their best.

## Long-Term Care and Prevention for Travertine Floors

Maintaining the beauty of your travertine floors is an ongoing commitment. Beyond routine cleaning and occasional deep cleaning, long-term care and preventive measures are essential. These proactive steps minimize wear and tear, reduce the risk of damage, and ensure your floors remain a stunning feature in your home for decades. I believe prevention is always easier and less expensive than repair.

### Strategies for Long-Term Preservation

*   **Regular Sealing:** As discussed, sealing is paramount. Test your sealer regularly (every 6-12 months) and reapply as needed to maintain maximum protection against stains and moisture.
*   **Use Floor Mats and Rugs:** Place doormats at all exterior entrances to trap dirt, grit, and moisture before it reaches your travertine. Use area rugs in high-traffic zones like hallways
