## Crafting a Zippered Pillow Cover: Your DIY Guide

Have you ever wanted to refresh your home decor without spending a lot? Making a pillow cover with a zipper is a fantastic way to do this. It allows you to change your decor quickly and adds a professional touch to your homemade items. This guide will walk you through every step, from selecting your fabric to sewing in the zipper.

I remember my first time trying to make a zippered pillow cover. It seemed daunting at first. However, with the right steps, it becomes a simple and rewarding project. We will cover choosing materials, accurate measuring, cutting fabric, and successfully installing your zipper. You will create beautiful, washable pillow covers for any room. Let's start this creative journey together.

### Takeaway:
*   Choose durable, washable fabric and the correct zipper type for your pillow cover.
*   Accurately measure your pillow insert and add seam allowances for precise cutting.
*   Prepare fabric edges carefully before sewing in the zipper.
*   Use a zipper foot to install the zipper smoothly, whether centered or invisible.
*   Sew the remaining seams and finish the edges for a professional pillow cover.
*   Consider decorative elements and proper care to prolong the life of your cover.
*   Address common issues like uneven seams or puckering zippers with simple fixes.

Making a pillow cover with a zipper involves selecting suitable fabric and a zipper, accurately measuring your pillow insert, cutting the fabric with seam allowances, and carefully sewing the zipper into place before assembling the remaining seams. This process creates a durable, washable, and easily changeable pillow cover.

## Gather Your Essential Supplies for a Zippered Pillow Cover

Before you begin sewing, it is important to gather all your materials. Having everything ready saves time and makes the process smoother. Think of this as preparing your workspace for a successful project. I always lay out my tools first.

Choosing the right fabric is your first step. Consider fabrics like cotton, linen, or home decor weight fabrics. These materials hold their shape well and are durable for daily use. A heavier fabric often gives a more luxurious feel.

You will also need a zipper. The length should be at least two inches shorter than the side you are sewing it into. For example, a 20-inch pillow needs an 18-inch zipper. I prefer a coil zipper for pillow covers because it is less likely to snag or break. An invisible zipper offers a very clean finish.

Next, collect your sewing tools. You need a sewing machine equipped with a zipper foot. A regular presser foot will not work as well for zipper installation. You also need good fabric scissors, a measuring tape, pins, thread that matches your fabric, and an iron. These tools are fundamental for any sewing project.

### Fabric Selection for Durability and Style

The fabric you choose sets the tone for your pillow cover. Consider where the pillow will be used. For high-traffic areas, select sturdy fabrics. Cotton twill, denim, or even upholstery fabric work well. For decorative pillows, you can experiment with velvet, silk, or textured weaves.

Always pre-wash and dry your fabric before cutting. This prevents shrinkage later and ensures your cover will fit correctly after washing. I learned this lesson the hard way once! Pre-washing also removes any factory chemicals, making the fabric softer to work with. Choose a fabric that complements your room's existing decor.

Consider the pattern and color of your fabric. Large patterns might look best on bigger pillows. Smaller prints or solid colors are versatile for any size. Think about how the fabric feels; you want it to be comfortable if the pillow will be used for lounging. The right fabric choice elevates the final look of your DIY pillow cover.

### Choosing the Right Zipper Type

Zippers come in different styles, and your choice impacts the final look of your pillow cover. A standard coil zipper is common and easy to install. It has visible teeth, but they blend in well. These are durable and widely available.

An invisible zipper, on the other hand, disappears completely into the seam when closed. This creates a very clean and professional finish. Installing an invisible zipper requires a special invisible zipper foot for your sewing machine. Many people prefer the sleek look of an invisible zipper for home decor items.

Metal zippers are usually stronger but can be bulkier and might scratch furniture. I generally avoid them for pillow covers unless the design specifically calls for a heavy-duty, industrial look. Select a zipper color that matches or coordinates with your fabric. This helps the zipper blend in, regardless of its type.

### Essential Sewing Tools You'll Need

Having the right tools makes all the difference when you make a pillow cover with zipper. Your sewing machine is the star. Make sure it is in good working order. A sharp needle is also important. Dull needles can snag your fabric.

A zipper foot attachment for your sewing machine is crucial. This foot allows you to sew very close to the zipper teeth without hitting them. Most sewing machines come with a standard zipper foot, and an invisible zipper foot can be purchased separately. This tool makes zipper installation much simpler.

Other important tools include a good pair of fabric scissors. Never use them on paper; it dulls them quickly. A rotary cutter and mat can also speed up fabric cutting. You will need a measuring tape or ruler for precise measurements. Lots of pins keep your fabric pieces aligned while sewing. An iron and ironing board are essential for pressing seams flat and creating crisp edges. A seam ripper is also a good idea for any mistakes!

## Precise Measurements and Fabric Cutting for Your Pillow Cover

Accuracy is key when you make a pillow cover with zipper. Taking correct measurements ensures a snug fit for your pillow insert. Cutting your fabric precisely prevents skewed shapes and helps your cover look professional. This step often determines the success of your project.

Start by measuring your pillow insert, not an old pillow cover. Pillow inserts can vary slightly in size. Measure the length and width across the middle of the pillow. Do not press down too hard; just measure its natural dimensions. Write these numbers down immediately.

Next, you will calculate your fabric dimensions. For the cover's length, add one inch to your pillow's length. This accounts for a half-inch seam allowance on both sides. For the width, add one inch to your pillow's width. So, if your pillow is 18x18 inches, you will cut two pieces of fabric, each 19x19 inches. This creates a slightly smaller cover, which makes the pillow look full.

Now, cut your fabric. Lay your pre-washed and ironed fabric flat. Use your measuring tape and a fabric marker or chalk to mark your dimensions. Cut carefully along these lines. I often use a rotary cutter and a clear ruler for perfect straight lines. Remember, you need two identical pieces of fabric for a basic pillow cover.

### Measuring Your Pillow Accurately

Measuring the pillow insert correctly is the most critical step. Do not measure an existing cover, as covers can stretch or shrink. Place your pillow insert on a flat surface. Use a soft measuring tape. Measure from seam to seam across the pillow's center for both length and width.

If your pillow insert is very fluffy, do not squish it completely flat. Just gently smooth it. This ensures your pillow cover will be snug, giving the pillow a nice, full appearance. A loose pillow cover looks sloppy. Write down your exact measurements. For example, if your pillow is 20 inches by 20 inches, record "20 x 20 inches."

Sometimes, pillow inserts are not perfectly square or rectangular. Measure at a few different points to find the average or largest dimension. It is better to have a slightly snug cover than a baggy one. Once you have these exact numbers, you can move on to the next step with confidence.

### Calculating Fabric Dimensions with Seam Allowances

Now that you have your pillow's dimensions, let's calculate the fabric size. You need to add seam allowances to your measurements. A standard seam allowance for pillow covers is half an inch (0.5 inches). This means you add 0.5 inches for each seam.

For a pillow that is, for example, 18 inches by 18 inches:
*   **Length:** 18 inches (pillow length) + 0.5 inches (top seam) + 0.5 inches (bottom seam) = 19 inches.
*   **Width:** 18 inches (pillow width) + 0.5 inches (left seam) + 0.5 inches (right seam) = 19 inches.
So, you would cut two fabric pieces, each 19 inches by 19 inches. This applies whether you are making a square or a rectangular pillow cover.

Some sewers like to subtract a half-inch from the final calculated dimensions to make the cover extra snug. For example, cutting 18.5 x 18.5 inches for an 18x18 pillow. This is optional but can create a very full look. For your first project, sticking to the standard seam allowance is perfectly fine. Precision here makes the rest of the sewing much easier. When you make a pillow cover with zipper, the fit matters.

### Accurate Fabric Cutting Techniques

Cutting your fabric accurately is as important as measuring. Lay your fabric flat on a large surface. Make sure it is smooth and wrinkle-free. I always iron my fabric before cutting to ensure no distortions. Use weights to hold the fabric down if it tends to shift.

Use a clear ruler and a fabric marker or tailor's chalk to mark your cutting lines. For long, straight cuts, a rotary cutter and a cutting mat are ideal. They provide cleaner, straighter edges than scissors. If using scissors, make long, even cuts, keeping your fabric flat on the table. Do not lift the fabric too much as you cut.

Cut two identical pieces of fabric based on your calculated dimensions. Ensure the grain of the fabric runs consistently for both pieces. This helps the pillow cover hang correctly and prevents stretching in unwanted directions. Take your time with this step. Accurate cutting is the foundation of a well-made pillow cover.

## Preparing Your Fabric for Zipper Installation

Once your fabric pieces are cut, the next step is to prepare the edge where the zipper will be inserted. Proper preparation ensures a smooth, even zipper application. This is a critical stage in the process of how to make a pillow cover with zipper. I find pressing the fabric makes a huge difference.

Choose one of the longer sides on both fabric pieces if you have a rectangular pillow. If your pillow is square, just pick one side. This will be the side where the zipper goes. We will work with these two edges first.

Take one fabric piece. Fold down the edge you chose by half an inch towards the wrong side of the fabric. Press this fold with a hot iron. This creates a crisp, clean edge. Repeat this step for the corresponding edge on the second fabric piece. These pressed edges will form the opening for your zipper.

Now, lay your two fabric pieces right sides together. Align the pressed edges that will hold the zipper. Pin them together at the top and bottom, approximately one inch from each end. Leave the middle section, where the zipper will go, unpinned for now. This temporary stitching creates a stable channel for the zipper.

### Pressing and Hemming Edges for a Clean Finish

Pressing is a powerful tool in sewing, especially when preparing for zipper installation. After you cut your two fabric pieces, identify the edge on each piece where the zipper will be inserted. This is typically one of the longer sides.

Fold down this edge by 0.5 inches towards the wrong side of the fabric. Use a hot iron to press this fold firmly. This creates a neat, flat edge. This pressed edge will be where the zipper tape is sewn. It gives your zipper a professional, finished look.

Next, you will create a temporary seam. Place the two fabric pieces right sides together. Align the pressed edges. Pin them together only at the very ends, about 1 inch from each corner. Leave the entire middle section open. This seam will eventually open up to house the zipper.

Sew a basting stitch (a long, temporary stitch) across the entire length of this seam. Use a regular stitch length for the first and last inch, and then switch to a long basting stitch for the middle section where the zipper will lie. This creates a guide and keeps the fabric stable. Remember to backstitch at the beginning and end of the seam to secure it. This step helps stabilize the fabric before you actually sew in the zipper.

### Marking Zipper Placement Accurately

Once your fabric edges are prepped, marking the zipper placement is the next step. This ensures your zipper is centered and lies flat. Lay your fabric pieces with the basted seam face up. Place your zipper on top of this seam, centered between the top and bottom edges.

The zipper pull should be inside the basted seam area. Mark the starting and ending points of the zipper teeth on your fabric. These marks will tell you exactly where to sew your permanent stitches. You can use tailor's chalk or a fabric marker for this. I usually place a pin at each end of the zipper teeth to mark the start and stop points.

You will sew the zipper onto the pressed edges. So, you need to mark the area where the zipper tape will attach. For a centered zipper, your basted seam acts as the center line. For an invisible zipper, the folds you pressed become the guides. These markings are essential for sewing the zipper straight and correctly. Take your time to measure and mark accurately. This avoids crooked zippers.

## Mastering Zipper Installation: Step-by-Step Guide

Installing the zipper can seem intimidating, but with the right steps, it is quite manageable. This is where your zipper foot becomes indispensable. We will cover how to make a pillow cover with zipper by focusing on smooth, even zipper placement. I usually take a deep breath before this step.

First, if you created a temporary basted seam, carefully press the seam open. The basted stitches will still be there, holding the fabric together, but the seam allowance will be flat. Lay your zipper face down centered over the pressed-open seam. The zipper teeth should be directly over the basted seam line.

Pin the zipper tape to the seam allowances on both sides. Make sure the zipper pull is easily accessible. Attach your zipper foot to your sewing machine. Sew a line of stitching along both sides of the zipper. Start and stop at the marks you made earlier, where the zipper teeth begin and end. Your stitches should be close to the zipper teeth but not on them.

After sewing both sides, flip the fabric over to the right side. Using a seam ripper, carefully remove the basted stitches from the top of the fabric. This will reveal your perfectly installed zipper. Open and close the zipper a few times to ensure it moves freely. Now, your pillow cover has a working zipper! For a more detailed guide on this specific task, see [how to sew a zipper on a pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-sew-a-zipper-on-a-pillow).

### Centered Zipper Installation Method

A centered zipper is a classic and straightforward way to add a zipper. It creates a neat look with two lines of stitching visible on the right side of the fabric. This method is great for beginners. It provides excellent stability for the zipper.

Start with your fabric pieces right sides together, with the basted seam pressed open. Lay the zipper face down on top of the open seam, centering the zipper teeth over the basted seam. Pin the zipper tape to the seam allowance on both sides. Ensure the zipper pull is closed and out of the way.

Attach your zipper foot. Stitch down one side of the zipper, starting and stopping at your marked points. Keep your needle close to the zipper teeth. Pivot at the bottom, sew across the end of the zipper, and then stitch up the other side. This creates a rectangular box of stitching around your zipper. Backstitch at the start and end of your permanent stitches for security.

After stitching, remove the basting stitches from the right side of your fabric using a seam ripper. Carefully snip them one by one. Your zipper will now be visible and functional. Pull the zipper open and closed a few times to test it. You have successfully installed a centered zipper.

### Invisible Zipper Technique

The invisible zipper offers a virtually hidden closure, giving your pillow cover a very clean and professional finish. This technique requires an invisible zipper foot. The steps are slightly different from a centered zipper.

First, do not create a basted seam. Instead, prepare the two edges for the zipper by pressing a 0.5-inch hem to the wrong side. Then, open your invisible zipper completely. Lay one side of the open zipper face down on one of the pressed fabric edges, aligning the zipper teeth with the fold. Pin it in place.

Attach your invisible zipper foot. Position the foot so that the zipper coil runs through the groove on the foot. Sew down the length of the zipper tape, very close to the teeth. The foot will gently unroll the zipper teeth as you sew, allowing you to get a close stitch. Stop sewing about one inch from the end of the zipper tape.

Close the zipper partway. Now, lay the second fabric piece's pressed edge right side up, next to the already sewn zipper side. Position the unsewn side of the zipper tape face down on this second fabric edge, aligning the teeth with the fold. Open the zipper, pin, and sew as you did the first side. When finished, close the zipper. It should disappear beautifully into the seam.

### Finishing Zipper Ends Securely

Securing the ends of your zipper is important for durability and a clean look. This prevents the zipper from pulling away from the fabric over time. It also keeps the zipper pull from accidentally sliding off the track. I always pay attention to these small details.

After you have sewn both sides of your zipper, you will have a small amount of zipper tape extending beyond your permanent stitching lines. For a centered zipper, you will have sewn a box around it, naturally securing the ends. For an invisible zipper, you might need an extra step.

With an invisible zipper, the permanent stitching usually stops a bit before the end of the zipper tape. To secure it, you can sew a small bar tack across the bottom of the zipper teeth, on the seam allowance. This is a few zigzag stitches or very short, tight straight stitches back and forth. This reinforces the end of the zipper and prevents it from opening too far.

Trim any excess zipper tape, leaving about a half-inch beyond your stitching. This prevents bulk in your seams. Make sure to keep the zipper pull inside the pillow cover when you sew the remaining side seams. This is a common mistake I have made! If the zipper is open, it is much easier to turn the pillow cover right side out later.

## Assembling and Finishing Your Pillow Cover Sides

With the zipper securely in place, you are now ready to assemble the rest of your pillow cover. This involves sewing the remaining three sides. This step is about connecting the pieces to form the pillow's shape. It is satisfying to see it come together.

First, open your newly installed zipper halfway. This is a crucial step! If you sew all sides with the zipper closed, you will not be able to turn the cover right side out. Lay your two fabric pieces right sides together, ensuring all edges align perfectly. Pin the raw edges together around the three remaining sides.

Now, take your project to the sewing machine. Using a 0.5-inch seam allowance, sew along the three unstitched sides. Start at one end of your zippered seam, sew down one side, pivot at the corner, sew across the bottom, pivot again, and sew up the final side. Remember to backstitch at the beginning and end of your seams for extra strength.

After sewing, clip the corners. Cut diagonally across the corner, very close to your stitch line but without cutting the stitches. This reduces bulk in the corners and helps them turn out sharply. Finally, turn your pillow cover right side out through the partially open zipper. Use a point turner or a blunt object to gently push out the corners. Press the finished pillow cover with an iron.

### Pinning Sides Together for Even Seams

Proper pinning is essential for achieving even, straight seams. Once your zipper is in, lay your two fabric pieces right sides together. Make sure the fabric edges are perfectly aligned. If you have a patterned fabric, ensure the pattern matches up at the seams.

Start pinning from the corners, working your way inward. Place pins perpendicularly to the seam line. This allows you to sew over them (carefully) without removing them, though I prefer to remove them just before my needle reaches them. Space your pins every 2-3 inches to keep the fabric from shifting.

Pay special attention to the corners where your zipper seam meets the side seams. Ensure these junctions are perfectly aligned and pinned securely. Misaligned corners can lead to a crooked pillow cover. Take your time during this pinning phase. It directly impacts the quality of your finished product. When you make a pillow cover with zipper, the final shape is important.

### Sewing the Remaining Side Seams

With your fabric pinned, it is time to sew the three remaining sides of your pillow cover. This creates the main structure. Remember to keep the zipper half-open before you start sewing. This allows you to turn the pillow cover right side out once finished.

Start sewing at one end of your zipper seam. Use a 0.5-inch seam allowance. Sew straight down the first side. When you reach a corner, stop with your needle down in the fabric, lift the presser foot, pivot the fabric 90 degrees, lower the presser foot, and continue sewing. Repeat this for all three sides.

Ensure your stitches are consistent and straight. Backstitch at the beginning and end of your seam. This reinforces the seams, making them durable enough to withstand repeated use and washing. If you are using a serger, you can finish your raw edges for an even more professional look. Otherwise, a zigzag stitch or pinking shears will prevent fraying.

### Clipping Corners and Turning Right Side Out

After sewing all three sides, your pillow cover is almost done! The next step is clipping the corners. This step is small but makes a big difference in the finished look. When you make a pillow cover with zipper, sharp corners look best.

Using your fabric scissors, carefully clip the excess fabric from each of the three sewn corners. Cut diagonally across the corner, very close to your stitch line. Be careful not to cut *through* your stitches. This reduces bulk in the corners. It allows them to turn out crisply and sharply when the cover is inverted.

Now, reach through the partially open zipper and carefully turn the entire pillow cover right side out. Use a point turner, a chopstick, or even your fingers to gently push out each corner from the inside. Be gentle to avoid poking a hole in your freshly sewn seams. Once turned, give the entire pillow cover a final press with your iron. This will flatten the seams and give it a polished finish. Now you can admire your new zippered pillow cover!

## Adding Decorative Touches and Care Instructions

Once your pillow cover is complete, you might want to add some personal flair. Decorative touches can make your pillow truly unique. Beyond aesthetics, knowing how to care for your new cover ensures its longevity. I love seeing how a small detail can transform a simple cover.

Consider embellishments like piping, fringe, or tassels sewn into the seams before final assembly. Embroidery or appliqué can be added to the fabric pieces before sewing them together. For a subtle texture, think about quilting a panel of fabric or creating a tufted design. These elements elevate the pillow's design. Guides like [how to make a ruffle for a pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-a-ruffle-for-a-pillow) or [how to make a tufted pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-a-tufted-pillow) offer great ideas.

Proper care is essential. The cleaning instructions for your pillow cover depend heavily on the fabric you chose. Always refer to the fabric's original care instructions. Generally, most cotton or linen pillow covers can be machine washed on a gentle cycle with cold water. Tumble dry low or air dry to prevent shrinkage and maintain fabric quality.

If your fabric is delicate, like silk or velvet, hand washing or dry cleaning might be necessary. Always zip the cover closed before washing to protect the zipper. Regular washing helps keep your pillow covers fresh and looking new. Taking a little extra care makes your handmade items last longer.

### Embellishment Ideas for Your Custom Pillow Cover

Customizing your pillow cover allows you to express your creativity. There are many ways to add decorative elements. Think about the style of your room and the look you want to achieve.

*   **Piping:** Add piping around the outer edges of the pillow cover. This gives a defined, tailored look. You can make your own piping or buy pre-made cording.
*   **Fringe or Tassels:** Sew fringe or tassels into the seams of your pillow cover. This adds a bohemian or luxurious touch. These are often applied before sewing the final seams.
*   **Appliqué:** Cut shapes from contrasting fabric and sew them onto the front panel of your pillow cover. This can create a focal point. Simple shapes like leaves or geometric designs work well.
*   **Embroidery:** Hand or machine embroidery can add intricate patterns or monograms. This personalizes your pillow. Plan your design before cutting the fabric.
*   **Fabric Manipulation:** Consider techniques like pleating, gathering, or ruching on a portion of the fabric. This adds texture and dimension. For a creative approach, consider [how to make a quilted pillow](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-make-a-quilted-pillow) for added texture.

These embellishments turn a simple pillow cover into a statement piece. Experiment with different ideas to find what you like best.

### Washing and Care for Longevity

To ensure your handmade pillow covers last for years, follow proper care instructions. The lifespan of your cover depends on how you clean it. Always check the care label of your fabric, if available.

For most cotton and linen covers, machine wash in cold water on a gentle cycle. Use a mild detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach, as these can fade colors and weaken fabric fibers. It is a good idea to zip the cover closed before washing. This protects the zipper from getting snagged or damaged during the wash cycle.

Tumble dry on a low heat setting or, even better, air dry the pillow covers. High heat can cause shrinkage and set wrinkles. Once dry, a quick iron can smooth out any remaining creases. For delicate fabrics like silk, velvet, or heavily embellished covers, hand washing or professional dry cleaning may be necessary. Treat stains promptly and gently to avoid permanent damage. Proper care keeps your covers looking fresh and extends their life. This is also important for the internal pillow.

## Troubleshooting Common Pillow Cover Issues

Even experienced sewers encounter problems sometimes. When you make a pillow cover with zipper, knowing how to troubleshoot common issues saves time and frustration. Do not be discouraged if something does not go perfectly the first time. I have ripped out countless seams!

One common issue is uneven seams. This can happen if your fabric shifts while sewing or if your seam allowance is inconsistent. To fix this, use a seam ripper to carefully undo the uneven section. Re-pin the fabric, ensuring edges are aligned and seam allowance is consistent. Then, re-sew slowly. Using a walking foot can also help with slippery fabrics.

Zipper puckering is another frequent problem. This occurs when the fabric around the zipper gets pulled or stretched during sewing. To prevent this, ensure
