Yes, you can start your Samsung dryer remotely using the Samsung SmartThings app. You must enable the "Smart Control" or "SmartThings" function on your dryer first. This allows you to select cycles, monitor progress, and begin drying from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Understanding Samsung's SmartThings Connectivity for Your Dryer

Samsung created the SmartThings platform to bring smart devices together. This platform allows many different home appliances and electronics to communicate. It makes managing your home easier. Your Samsung dryer is part of this network. It connects to your home Wi-Fi and then to the SmartThings app on your phone.

This connection lets you use smart features like remote control. When your dryer connects to SmartThings, you gain control from almost anywhere. You can check dryer status, choose settings, and even start a drying cycle. This connectivity changes how you do laundry. It gives you more flexibility and power.

The term "Smart Control" on your dryer refers to this remote access feature. When you turn on Smart Control, your dryer prepares for remote commands. It waits for instructions from your phone through the SmartThings app. This system ensures that only you can control your dryer. It keeps your home secure. If you want to know more about turning your dryer on with your phone, you can find detailed information about [how you can turn your Samsung dryer on with your phone](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-i-turn-my-samsung-dryer-on-with-my-phone). This guide helps you understand the basics of remote operation.

Many Samsung dryer models come with built-in Wi-Fi. This means they are ready for smart home integration. You do not need extra hardware for basic remote functions. The SmartThings app acts as your central control hub. It shows you the status of all connected devices, including your dryer. This system makes your daily tasks smoother.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Connect Your Samsung Dryer to SmartThings

Connecting your Samsung dryer to the SmartThings app is a simple process. It involves a few clear steps. You will need your Wi-Fi network details and your phone ready. I found these steps very easy to follow when I first set up my own dryer.

### Downloading the SmartThings App

First, get the SmartThings app. You can find it in the Apple App Store for iPhones or Google Play Store for Android phones. Search for "Samsung SmartThings." Download and install the app. Then, create a Samsung account or log in if you have one. This account links your devices and settings.

### Registering Your Dryer

Now, let us connect your dryer.
1.  **Open the SmartThings App:** Launch the app on your phone.
2.  **Add Device:** Tap the plus sign (+) icon, usually in the top right corner. Then select "Device."
3.  **Find Your Dryer:** The app might auto-detect your dryer. If not, choose "By brand," then "Samsung," and find "Dryer" from the list.
4.  **Power On Your Dryer:** Make sure your dryer is plugged in and turned on.
5.  **Connect to Wi-Fi:** Follow the on-screen instructions in the app. This often involves pressing and holding specific buttons on your dryer's control panel. The dryer will enter an "AP" (Access Point) mode. This lets your phone connect directly to the dryer for setup.
6.  **Select Your Home Wi-Fi Network:** Once your phone connects to the dryer, the app will ask you to select your home Wi-Fi network. Enter your Wi-Fi password.
7.  **Complete Setup:** The app will finalize the connection. Your dryer will then connect to your home Wi-Fi network. The SmartThings app will confirm the device has been added successfully. It usually takes only a few minutes. You now have your dryer connected to your phone.

## Enabling Remote Start on Your Samsung Dryer for Phone Control

Connecting your dryer to the SmartThings app is only the first step. To actually start your Samsung dryer from your phone, you must enable the remote control function on the dryer itself. This feature is often called "Smart Control" or "SmartThings" on the dryer's display. It is a safety measure. You cannot remotely start a dryer that is not ready for remote commands.

Most Samsung dryers require you to press a specific button on the control panel to activate Smart Control. Look for a button labeled "Smart Control," "SmartThings," or an icon that looks like a Wi-Fi signal or a smartphone. You typically press this button once for it to light up. This indicates the dryer is in remote-ready mode. If you do not press this button, the app cannot send the start command.

This step is very important. It ensures that the dryer only starts when you intend it to. For example, if someone accidentally presses a remote start button on their phone, but the dryer's physical Smart Control button is not active, the dryer will not start. This prevents unintended operation, such as starting a dryer when clothes are not inside. It also makes sure the dryer door is closed. The dryer will not start remotely if the door is open. The cycle must also be pre-selected on the dryer panel before you leave. This helps prevent issues like [why your Samsung dryer turns on but not start](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dryer-turning-on-but-not-starting) when using remote functions.

Always make sure the Smart Control light is on before you leave your home. This light usually stays on until the cycle finishes or the dryer loses power. If the light is off, you will need to activate it again to use remote start. This small step ensures a safe and effective remote laundry experience.

## Using the SmartThings App to Start and Monitor Your Dryer Remotely

Once your Samsung dryer connects to SmartThings and has "Smart Control" enabled, your phone becomes a powerful remote. I find this feature incredibly useful for managing laundry on my own schedule. The app's interface is clear and simple to use.

Open the SmartThings app on your phone. Find your dryer on the main dashboard. Tap on the dryer icon to open its control screen. Here, you see your dryer's current status. It will show if it is off, running, or ready.

You can select the drying cycle you want directly from the app. You will see options similar to those on your dryer's physical panel, like "Normal," "Delicates," "Wrinkle Prevent," or "Time Dry." You can also adjust temperature settings or other drying options. Make sure the dryer door is closed and the Smart Control option is active on the dryer. If the dryer door is open or the Smart Control option is off, the app will tell you the dryer cannot start.

To start the dryer remotely, simply select your desired settings in the app and tap the "Start" button. The dryer will then begin its cycle. The app also shows real-time progress. You can see how much time is left in the cycle. This helps you plan your day. You can also see alerts. These alerts tell you when a cycle is finished. This way, your clothes do not sit in the dryer for too long. You can remove them promptly to prevent wrinkles.

## Benefits of Remote Dryer Control and Smart Laundry Management

Using your phone to control your Samsung dryer offers many benefits beyond simple convenience. These smart features change how you handle laundry chores. They help you save time and manage energy better. I have personally found these benefits to be a game-changer for my household routine.

### Time-Saving Convenience

The main benefit is convenience. You no longer need to be at home to start a load of laundry. If you are at work or running errands, you can start the dryer when you are almost home. This means your clothes finish drying right when you arrive. You can immediately fold them. This saves you from waiting for a cycle to finish. It frees up your time for other activities. It also stops clothes from sitting wet in the washer too long, which can cause odors.

### Optimized Energy Use

Smart dryers can help you save energy. Many utility companies offer lower electricity rates during off-peak hours. With remote control, you can schedule your dryer to run during these times. You start the cycle from your phone when rates are low, even if you are not home. This helps lower your energy bills. The app can also provide insights into your dryer's energy use. This helps you make informed choices about your laundry habits. If you notice your dryer takes a long time, the app might help you identify usage patterns. For issues like [why your Samsung dryer takes so long to dry](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-samsung-dryer-take-so-long-to-dry), smart monitoring can provide clues or help you adjust settings.

Remote control also means you get notifications. You know exactly when your clothes are dry. This stops you from running the dryer longer than needed. Over-drying wastes energy and can damage clothes. The app tells you when to take them out. This extends the life of your garments. These features make smart laundry management efficient and user-friendly.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues with Samsung Dryer Remote Start

While using your Samsung dryer with your phone is convenient, sometimes you might run into problems. Most issues are easy to fix. I have encountered a few myself, and a little troubleshooting usually resolves them quickly.

### Wi-Fi Connection Problems

The most common issue is a lost Wi-Fi connection. Your dryer needs a stable Wi-Fi signal to communicate with your phone.
*   **Check Your Wi-Fi Router:** Make sure your home Wi-Fi router is on and working.
*   **Dryer Distance:** Your dryer might be too far from the router. Try moving the router closer or use a Wi-Fi extender.
*   **Restart Everything:** Turn off your dryer and unplug it for a minute. Restart your Wi-Fi router. Then plug in the dryer and try connecting again.
*   **App Refresh:** Close the SmartThings app completely on your phone and reopen it.

### App Not Connecting or Responding

Sometimes, the SmartThings app might not connect to the dryer, or it might not respond to commands.
*   **Smart Control Enabled:** Always check if the "Smart Control" or "SmartThings" light is active on your dryer's panel. If it is off, the dryer will not accept remote commands.
*   **Dryer Door:** Ensure the dryer door is fully closed. The dryer will not start remotely if the door is open.
*   **App Updates:** Make sure your SmartThings app is the latest version. App updates often fix bugs.
*   **Phone OS:** Check that your phone's operating system is up to date.
*   **Re-add Device:** If all else fails, you might need to remove your dryer from the SmartThings app and add it again. This often fixes deep connection problems.

If you encounter a problem where your Samsung dryer turns on but will not start, even when trying to use remote start, you might need to check other things. For specific issues like [why your Samsung dryer turns on but not starting](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-samsung-dryer-turning-on-but-not-starting), general troubleshooting for dryer mechanics might be needed. Sometimes, problems that appear to be remote start issues are actually dryer issues. You can also explore why your Samsung dryer might be displaying unusual time changes, like [why your Samsung dryer goes from 1 hour to 1 minute](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-samsung-dryer-go-from-1-hour-to-1-minute). This could be related to sensor issues that impact smart features. Regular maintenance, such as [cleaning your moisture sensor on your Samsung dryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-moisture-sensor-on-samsung-dryer), can prevent certain malfunctions that might affect smart operation.

## Maximizing Your Smart Samsung Dryer Experience

Getting your Samsung dryer to start from your phone is a great start. But you can do more to maximize your smart laundry experience. Thinking about how to use these features to their full potential makes laundry easier and more efficient.

### Regular Maintenance for Optimal Performance

A clean dryer works best, especially smart ones. A clogged lint filter or vent can affect drying times and efficiency. It can even impact how smart sensors work. Regularly cleaning your lint filter after every load is vital. Beyond that, deep cleaning the dryer vent system once or twice a year is important. This ensures proper airflow.

Clean dryers run more efficiently and safely. This also helps your smart dryer give you accurate information through the app.

Your Samsung dryer probably has more smart features than just remote start. Take time to explore all options in the SmartThings app.
*   **Cycle Recommendations:** Some models offer cycle recommendations based on your wash load.
*   **Energy Monitoring:** Track your dryer's energy usage over time to find ways to save.
*   **Proactive Care:** The app can alert you to potential issues with your dryer. It might suggest maintenance before a problem becomes big. This keeps your dryer running smoothly for longer.
*   **Smart Home Automation:** If you have other SmartThings devices, you can create automated routines. For example, your smart lights could turn on when the dryer finishes a cycle. This creates a fully connected laundry experience.

### Keep Firmware Updated

Samsung frequently releases firmware updates for its appliances. These updates can improve performance, add new features, or fix bugs. The SmartThings app usually notifies you when an update is available for your dryer. Make sure to install these updates.
