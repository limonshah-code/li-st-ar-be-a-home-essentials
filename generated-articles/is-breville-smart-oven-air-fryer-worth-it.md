### A Clear Answer: Is the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Worth It?

Yes, the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is worth it for those who seek a versatile, high-performing countertop appliance. It excels at air frying, baking, roasting, and more, offering precise control and consistent results. Its multi-functionality saves counter space and streamlines cooking tasks effectively.

### Unpacking the Core Features of the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer comes packed with features designed to improve your cooking experience. Its design combines a toaster oven with an air fryer. This creates a powerful multi-functional appliance for your kitchen. I found its range of cooking presets particularly helpful for different dishes. You select your food, and the oven suggests the best settings. This makes cooking simple, even for complex recipes.

One key technology is Element IQ. This system adjusts power to the heating elements. It ensures consistent temperatures throughout the cooking process. For instance, when I bake cookies, they brown evenly. This precision is important for good results. You will notice the difference in texture and taste. This technology helps food cook thoroughly and uniformly.

The appliance offers a generous capacity. You can fit a 14-pound turkey or a 9x13 inch pan inside. This size makes it suitable for families or for preparing larger meals. I often cook full sheet pan dinners inside it. The large interior means fewer batches and less time spent in the kitchen. Many smaller air fryers cannot handle such large items. This capacity is a major advantage for Breville.

Its 11 smart cooking functions simplify meal preparation. These functions include Toast, Bagel, Bake, Roast, Broil, Pizza, Cookies, Air Fry, Reheat, Warm, and Slow Cook. Each function uses the Element IQ technology for optimal results. For example, the air fry setting circulates hot air powerfully around food. This creates crispy textures with less oil. I have made excellent crispy fries and chicken wings using this setting. These pre-set functions take the guesswork out of cooking. You can also customize the time and temperature settings.

The interior light is another thoughtful feature. It turns on automatically at the end of the cooking cycle. You can also press a button to check on your food without opening the door. This helps maintain consistent temperatures during cooking. I appreciate not having to open the door, which lets heat escape. This light makes monitoring food easy and efficient. These features combine to offer a comprehensive cooking solution.

### Air Frying Performance: Does the Breville Deliver Crispy Results?

Many people buy the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer primarily for its air frying capability. I was curious to see if it lived up to the hype. Traditional deep frying uses a lot of oil. Air frying aims to achieve similar crispy results with much less fat. The Breville unit uses a powerful fan that circulates hot air rapidly. This hot air surrounds the food, creating a crispy outer layer.

I have tested its air frying function with various foods. French fries, chicken wings, and vegetables all come out with a satisfying crunch. The key is to arrange food in a single layer for best results. This allows the hot air to reach all surfaces. Overcrowding the basket can lead to uneven cooking. I recommend shaking or flipping food halfway through cooking. This ensures even browning and crispiness. My experience suggests that the Breville truly excels in this area. It delivers results very close to deep frying.

The high wattage and precise temperature control contribute to its air frying performance. Breville's Element IQ system plays a crucial role here. It directs heat where it is needed most. This helps foods cook quickly and evenly. I found that preheating the oven before adding food improves the crispiness. A hot environment from the start helps to sear the surface of the food. This creates a better texture.

Comparing it to dedicated, smaller air fryers, the Breville offers more space. This means you can air fry larger batches. This is a huge advantage for families. You do not have to cook food in multiple small rounds. This saves a lot of time. While it may take a minute or two longer due to its larger cavity, the quality of the air-fried food is consistently excellent. The results are comparable to, or even better than, many standalone air fryers I have used.

Learning [how to air fry in Breville Smart Oven Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-air-fry-in-breville-smart-oven-pro) can further enhance your cooking. The machine often provides prompts on its display. These guide you through the process effectively. Its air frying ability is a significant selling point. It truly helps you create healthier, crispy meals at home.

### Versatility Beyond Air Frying: Multi-Functional Cooking Power

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is more than just an air fryer. Its true strength lies in its multi-functionality. This appliance can handle many cooking tasks. It can replace several single-purpose kitchen gadgets. I often use it for baking, roasting, and toasting. This frees up my main oven, especially during holidays or when I am cooking multiple dishes.

The oven has a powerful "Roast" setting. This function is great for chicken, vegetables, or small cuts of meat. The Element IQ ensures even cooking. This means your roast chicken will have crispy skin and juicy meat. I have successfully roasted potatoes and carrots alongside proteins. They cooked perfectly at the same time. This saves both time and energy.

Baking is another strong suit. The consistent temperature control is vital for successful baking. Cookies, muffins, and small cakes bake evenly without hot spots. I have also used it for frozen pizzas. The "Pizza" setting works wonders, giving a perfectly crispy crust. The oven preheats quickly, which is a bonus. You do not have to wait long to start baking. This makes it ideal for quick weeknight meals.

You can even dehydrate foods with this Breville model. This feature is often found in dedicated dehydrators. The Brevilleâ€™s ability to maintain a low, consistent temperature for extended periods makes it possible. I have made dried fruit and jerky in it. This function adds another layer of versatility. If you are curious about this, you can learn more about [whether you can dehydrate in the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/can-you-dehydrate-in-the-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer). This allows for healthy, homemade snacks.

The Slow Cook function is also quite useful. It can cook dishes for hours at low temperatures. This is perfect for stews, braises, or pulled pork. It works just like a dedicated slow cooker. This level of versatility simplifies my kitchen setup. I use one appliance for almost everything. It makes cooking more efficient and less cluttered. This appliance truly covers a wide range of cooking needs effectively.

### Ease of Use and Intuitive Design

Using the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is surprisingly simple, considering its many functions. The control panel is well-designed. It has a clear LCD display that shows settings and cooking progress. There are dedicated dials for temperature and time. You turn them to adjust values, then press them to select. This interface is very intuitive. I picked it up quickly, even without reading the manual extensively.

The pre-set functions are a major convenience. You select the desired function from the list. The oven automatically sets the optimal temperature and time. For example, choosing "Toast" allows you to pick the number of slices and your desired browning level. This takes the guesswork out of daily tasks. I appreciate these smart prompts. They guide me through each cooking process effectively. This makes it easy to get consistent results.

The oven comes with several accessories. These include an enamel baking pan, a non-stick pizza pan, a wire rack, and an air fry basket. Each accessory fits perfectly. They are easy to insert and remove. The air fry basket slides into designated slots. This ensures proper air circulation around the food. The magnetic auto-eject rack is a smart design touch. It pulls the hot rack out slightly when you open the door. This helps you safely remove hot food without reaching deep into the oven.

The interior light makes it easy to monitor food. You do not need to open the door, which prevents heat loss. This feature is especially useful for baking. It ensures your cakes or breads cook evenly without temperature fluctuations. Overall, the design elements focus on user convenience. They make cooking a smooth experience.

If you are wondering how to get started, there are resources like [how to use Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-use-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer-pro). They can walk you through the initial setup and various functions. The simple operation combined with intelligent features makes this appliance a joy to use daily. It helps me create great meals with minimal effort.

### Cleaning and Maintenance Considerations

Keeping any kitchen appliance clean is important for hygiene and longevity. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer requires regular cleaning. Fortunately, its design makes this task manageable. The interior has a non-stick coating. This helps food residue wipe away easily. I usually clean it after each major use. This prevents food from baking onto the surfaces.

The accessories are also designed for easy cleaning. The baking pan and pizza pan are non-stick. They clean up well with warm, soapy water. The wire rack and air fry basket can also be washed by hand. For stubborn spots, soaking them for a short period helps loosen debris. I avoid abrasive scrubbers. They can damage the non-stick surfaces. A soft sponge is usually enough for thorough cleaning. You can find detailed instructions on [how to clean Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-breville-smart-oven-air-fryer).

The crumb tray is located at the bottom of the oven. It slides out for easy emptying. This is essential for preventing burnt odors and fire hazards. I empty it regularly, often after every few uses. This keeps the oven fresh and tidy. This simple step contributes significantly to overall cleanliness.

The heating elements are protected. You do not need to clean them directly. However, if food splatters onto them, it might create smoke. Wiping down the interior walls and top after cooking greasy foods is a good practice. This prevents buildup. For deeper cleaning, Breville recommends certain methods. You can find more information on [how to clean inside of Breville Air Fryer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-inside-of-breville-air-fryer). This ensures your oven stays in top condition.

While it is not entirely self-cleaning, the process is straightforward. The materials used resist sticking. This reduces the effort needed for maintenance. A clean oven performs better and lasts longer. Taking a few minutes after each use to wipe it down pays off. It keeps your Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer ready for its next cooking task. The ease of cleaning definitely adds to its value.

### Value Proposition: Price, Performance, and Durability

When considering if the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is worth it, its price is a significant factor. Breville appliances generally sit in the premium segment. This model is no exception. It costs more than basic toaster ovens or entry-level air fryers. However, its value comes from its performance, versatility, and durability. I believe the initial investment is justified by its long-term benefits.

The performance of the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is consistently excellent. The Element IQ system ensures precise temperature control. This leads to reliable cooking results every time. Whether I am air frying, baking, or roasting, the food comes out cooked evenly and perfectly. This level of precision is often missing in cheaper alternatives. It reduces cooking failures and food waste. This consistent quality adds significant value to the daily cooking experience.

Its multi-functionality means you get several appliances in one. It combines an air fryer, toaster oven, conventional oven, dehydrator, and slow cooker. This saves valuable counter space in your kitchen. Instead of buying and storing five different machines, you only need one. This consolidation is a huge benefit for smaller kitchens. It simplifies kitchen organization. If you are comparing, you might ask [is the Breville Smart Oven worth the money](https://homeessentialsguide.com/is-the-breville-smart-oven-worth-the-money) for its features alone.

Breville is known for building high-quality, durable appliances. The Smart Oven Air Fryer feels robust and well-made. It features brushed stainless steel construction. This gives it a premium look and feel. I expect it to last for many years with proper care. This longevity contributes to its overall value. A cheaper appliance might fail sooner, requiring replacement. This could lead to higher costs in the long run.

The energy efficiency is also worth noting. For smaller meals, using the Breville is often more energy-efficient than heating a full-sized oven. It preheats faster and cooks quicker. This can lead to savings on your utility bills over time. While the upfront cost is higher, the daily benefits and long-term savings often outweigh it.

### Potential Downsides and Limitations

No appliance is perfect, and the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer has a few considerations worth noting. Understanding these can help you decide if it fits your needs. While it is a versatile machine, there are some minor drawbacks. These factors might influence your purchase decision.

One point to consider is its physical size. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer is a substantial countertop appliance. It needs a dedicated space on your kitchen counter. For small kitchens with limited counter space, this could be an issue. Before buying, measure your available counter space carefully. Ensure it fits comfortably under your cabinets. While its large capacity is a benefit, it does come with a larger footprint.

Another consideration is the noise level during air frying. The powerful fan needed for effective air frying produces noticeable noise. It is not excessively loud, but you will hear it. It sounds similar to a range hood fan on a medium setting. This might be a factor if you have a very open living space or are sensitive to noise. I personally do not find it bothersome, but it is something to be aware of.

The oven exterior can get quite hot during operation. This is typical for many countertop ovens. You should exercise caution and avoid touching the sides or top while it is in use. Always use the handle to open the door. This is important for safety. Make sure to place it on a heat-resistant surface, away from walls or other heat-sensitive items. This is a common characteristic of powerful heating appliances.

Lastly, the price point is higher than many other brands. While I argue it offers excellent value, the initial investment is significant. If your budget is very limited, this might be a hurdle. You need to weigh the premium features and performance against the cost. Consider how often you will use its various functions. This helps justify the expense. Despite these points, its benefits often outweigh these minor limitations.

### Who Is the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Best Suited For?

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer serves a wide range of users, but it particularly shines for certain groups. Understanding its ideal user helps determine if it is the right fit for your kitchen and lifestyle. I believe it offers immense value to specific types of cooks and households.

It is perfect for individuals or families who appreciate multi-functional appliances. If you want to consolidate several gadgets into one, this oven is an excellent choice. It replaces a toaster, a standalone air fryer, and often reduces the need for your main oven. This saves valuable counter space and simplifies your cooking routine. For those with smaller kitchens, this space-saving aspect is a huge advantage.

Home cooks who prioritize precision and consistent results will love this appliance. The Element IQ technology ensures even cooking every time. If you often find yourself with unevenly cooked food in simpler appliances, the Breville provides a solution. It helps you achieve professional-level results at home. This applies to baking, roasting, and especially air frying. My food consistently cooks to perfection.

People who enjoy healthy cooking will find it very beneficial. The air frying function allows you to prepare crispy, delicious meals with significantly less oil. This makes healthier versions of your favorite fried foods accessible. The dehydrate function further supports a healthy lifestyle by enabling homemade snacks. It helps you control ingredients and reduce processed food consumption.

If you frequently entertain guests or cook for a small family, its generous capacity is a big plus. You can prepare larger batches of air-fried wings or roast a whole chicken. This avoids multiple cooking rounds. It makes meal preparation more efficient. It is also great for supplementary cooking during holidays when your main oven is busy. It acts as a second, powerful oven.

Finally, busy individuals or families will appreciate its speed and convenience. It preheats faster than a full-sized oven. Its pre-set functions simplify complex cooking tasks. This means less time spent waiting and more time enjoying your meals. It is a fantastic tool for quick weeknight dinners. It also helps with meal prepping for the week.
