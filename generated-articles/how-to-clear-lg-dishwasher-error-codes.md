## Understanding Your LG Dishwasher's Error Code System

Your LG dishwasher is a smart appliance. It uses error codes to tell you when something is wrong. These codes are not meant to confuse you. Instead, they provide clues about specific problems. Knowing what each code means helps you fix issues quickly.

Errors appear for many reasons. Sometimes it is a simple power glitch. Other times, a part might need cleaning or replacement. Understanding these signals helps you avoid unnecessary service calls. It also saves you money and time.

### Common Causes of Dishwasher Errors

Dishwasher errors usually point to a few key areas. Water supply issues are frequent culprits. A clogged drain line can also trigger error codes. Problems with heating or sensors also show up as errors.

Electrical glitches sometimes cause temporary error displays. These often clear with a simple reset. Mechanical failures, like a faulty pump or motor, also generate specific codes. Identifying the core problem is the first step in troubleshooting. Always check your dishwasher's user manual for the most accurate information on its specific error codes.

## The Universal First Step: Resetting Your LG Dishwasher

When an error code appears, the very first thing you should try is a reset. A reset can clear temporary glitches. It often restores normal operation. Think of it like restarting your computer when it acts up.

This step is simple and requires no tools. It gives the dishwasher's internal computer a fresh start. Many times, a quick reset solves the problem immediately. Do this before you try anything else.

### Power Cycling Methods: Unplug or Breaker

You can perform a power cycle in two main ways. The easiest method is to unplug the dishwasher from the wall outlet. Wait at least five minutes before plugging it back in. This ensures the appliance completely loses power.

If the power cord is hard to reach, go to your home's circuit breaker box. Find the breaker labeled for your kitchen or dishwasher. Flip it to the "off" position. Wait five minutes, then flip it back to "on." This achieves the same power interruption. This method is effective for various LG appliances. You can use similar methods to [reset LG refrigerator error code](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-lg-refrigerator-error-code) or other appliances.

Some LG dishwasher models offer a control panel reset. This usually involves holding down certain buttons for a few seconds. Common combinations include "Start/Pause" and "Cancel," or "Power" and "Start." Refer to your specific model's user manual for exact instructions.

This type of reset can sometimes clear errors without cutting power. However, a full power cycle is usually more effective for stubborn codes. Always try the power cycle first. It is the most reliable way to clear the dishwasher's memory.

## Decoding Specific LG Dishwasher Error Codes and Their Solutions

LG dishwashers display various error codes. Each code points to a particular issue. Knowing what each one means helps you fix the problem efficiently. Let's look at the most common codes and their solutions.

This section covers the typical error messages you might encounter. We will provide practical steps for each one. My aim is to help you understand the problem and fix it yourself.

### IE (Inlet Error)

The IE error code stands for "Inlet Error." This means the dishwasher is not getting enough water. It could be due to a closed water supply valve. A clogged water inlet filter is also a common cause. This error is similar to issues seen in other LG appliances. For instance, you might see a comparable error if you try to [fix LG washing machine IE error](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-washing-machine-ie-error).

To fix this, first check the water supply valve. Make sure it is fully open. Next, inspect the water inlet hose for kinks or bends. These can restrict water flow. Turn off the water supply to the dishwasher before disconnecting the hose.

#### Checking Water Inlet Valve and Hose

Locate the water inlet hose behind your dishwasher. It connects to the water supply valve on the wall. Ensure the valve is open. Check the hose for any visible kinks or damage.

Disconnect the hose from the dishwasher. There is often a small filter screen at the connection point. Clean this screen if it is clogged with debris. Reconnect the hose tightly after cleaning.

### OE (Outlet Error)

The OE error code signifies an "Outlet Error." This means the dishwasher is having trouble draining water. A clogged drain filter is the most frequent cause. A kinked or blocked drain hose can also trigger this error.

Standing water in the bottom of your dishwasher often indicates an OE error. This is a messy problem, but usually fixable. You may need to manually drain the water before working. This issue is similar to problems discussed in guides on [how to clear dishwasher drain line](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clear-dishwasher-drain-line).

#### Inspecting Drain Hose and Filter

Open your dishwasher and locate the drain filter assembly at the bottom. Twist and remove the filter according to your manual. Clean it thoroughly under running water, removing all food particles and debris.

Next, inspect the drain hose. It typically runs from the back of the dishwasher to your sink's drain or garbage disposal. Look for kinks or blockages. Disconnect it if necessary to clear any obstructions. Ensure your sink's air gap (if present) is also clear.

### LE (Leak Error)

The LE error code points to a "Leak Error." Your dishwasher has detected water leaking inside the unit. This triggers a safety mechanism to prevent water damage. It is a serious code that needs immediate attention.

Finding the source of a leak can be challenging. It might be a loose hose connection or a faulty pump seal. Sometimes, excessive suds can also trigger the leak sensor. Similar issues can occur in other brands.

#### Locating and Addressing Leaks

First, unplug the dishwasher for safety. Look under the dishwasher for visible water puddles. Check all hose connections for tightness. These include the inlet hose, drain hose, and internal hoses.

Inspect the door gasket for tears or cracks. A damaged gasket can cause water to escape. If you suspect a major component like the wash motor or pump, consider professional help. Minor leaks might be fixed with tightening, but complex ones need expertise.

### FE (Filling Error)

The FE error code stands for "Filling Error." This usually means the dishwasher is overfilling with water. It can also indicate a problem with the water level sensor. A malfunctioning inlet valve might also be stuck open, causing continuous filling.

This error is less common than IE or OE. When it appears, you might notice too much water in the tub. The dishwasher might also run for an unusually long time. It is a critical error that prevents proper operation.

#### Water Level Sensor and Pressure Switch

The water level sensor, also known as a pressure switch, tells the dishwasher how much water is inside. If this sensor is faulty, it can send incorrect readings. This might cause the dishwasher to overfill.

Check the sensor located at the bottom of the tub. It might be clogged with debris. Cleaning it can sometimes resolve the issue. If the inlet valve is allowing water in even when off, it needs replacement. This is a job for a technician.

### NE (No Heat Error / Heater Error)

The NE error code means "No Heat Error" or "Heater Error." Your dishwasher is unable to heat the water. This results in poor cleaning and drying performance. Dishes might come out wet and not fully sanitized.

This issue often points to a problem with the heating element itself. It could also be a faulty thermostat or a wiring issue. Addressing this ensures your dishes get properly cleaned and dried. This is a very common issue with LG dishwashers. You can find more specific guidance on [how to fix LG dishwasher NE error](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-fix-lg-dishwasher-ne-error).

#### Checking Heating Element and Thermostat

First, ensure the dishwasher has proper power. A heating element requires significant electricity. Visually inspect the heating element at the bottom of the tub. Look for any visible damage or signs of burning.

Use a multimeter to test the heating element for continuity. Also, test the thermostat, which controls the element's operation. If either component shows no continuity, it needs replacement. This task often requires disassembling part of the dishwasher.

### tE (Temperature Sensor Error)

The tE error code indicates a "Temperature Sensor Error." This means the thermistor, which measures water temperature, is not working correctly. The dishwasher needs accurate temperature readings for proper washing and drying cycles. If the thermistor gives incorrect readings, the dishwasher might not heat the water to the correct temperature or might not heat at all.

This error affects cycle performance significantly. It can lead to dishes not getting hot enough for sanitation. It might also cause extended cycle times. Replacing a faulty thermistor is often the solution.

#### Diagnosing Temperature Sensor Problems

The thermistor is usually located near the heating element or on the sump assembly. First, ensure there are no loose wire connections to the sensor. A simple visual inspection can sometimes reveal this.

To test the thermistor, you will need a multimeter. Measure its resistance. The resistance value should change with temperature. Compare your readings with the specifications in your service manual. A thermistor with a constant high or low reading, or one that shows infinite resistance, is likely faulty.

### CE (Communication Error)

The CE error code signifies a "Communication Error." This means the main control board is not communicating properly with other components. It could be an issue with the wiring harness or the control board itself. This error usually points to a more complex electrical problem.

This error can stop the dishwasher from starting or completing any cycle. It is a sign that the brain of your dishwasher is having trouble. Addressing this often requires electrical checks. This may be beyond typical DIY repairs.

#### Power Supply and Control Board Checks

Ensure the dishwasher has stable power. Fluctuations can sometimes trigger communication errors. Perform a full power cycle reset as a first step. This can sometimes re-establish communication.

If the error persists, inspect the wire harnesses connecting the control board to other components. Look for any loose, corroded, or damaged wires. A professional technician can test the control board itself. Replacement of the control board is often necessary for persistent CE errors.

### HE (Heating Element Error)

The HE error code, similar to NE, indicates a "Heating Element Error." While NE might point to a general heating issue, HE often specifically identifies a problem with the heating element's circuit. It suggests the element is not receiving power or has an internal fault. Your dishes will not dry properly if this element is not working.

This error directly impacts drying performance. It also affects the wash cycle's sanitization ability. Diagnosing this requires checking the element's electrical path.

#### Heater Coil and Circuit Checks

First, confirm the dishwasher is receiving power. The heating element is a large electrical component. Check the wiring connected to the heating element for any signs of damage or loose connections. These connections can sometimes become corroded over time.

Use a multimeter to test the continuity of the heating element coil. If there is no continuity, the element is open and needs replacement. Also, check the thermal fuse, which is a safety device linked to the heating circuit. A blown thermal fuse will cut power to the element.

### PF (Power Failure)

The PF error code stands for "Power Failure." This code appears when the dishwasher experiences an interruption in its power supply. It means the appliance lost power during a cycle. This is usually not a sign of a dishwasher defect itself.

This error is often caused by external factors. A tripped circuit breaker is the most common reason. A power outage in your home will also trigger this code. The dishwasher simply records that its power went out.

#### Restoring Power After an Outage

First, check your home's circuit breaker box. Locate the breaker that controls your dishwasher. If it is tripped (usually in the middle position), flip it fully off, then back to the on position. This restores power to the appliance.

If there was a neighborhood power outage, the PF code will clear once power is fully restored. No repair is typically needed for the dishwasher itself. It is a notification, not a fault. Run a test cycle to ensure everything works correctly after power is back on.

## Advanced Troubleshooting and When to Call a Professional

Sometimes, simple resets and basic checks are not enough. Some LG dishwasher error codes point to more complex issues. These might involve internal components or intricate wiring. Knowing when to call a professional saves you time and prevents further damage.

Do not attempt repairs that involve high voltage or complex disassembly if you are unsure. Appliance repair can be dangerous if you lack the proper knowledge. Safety should always be your top priority.

### Identifying Part Failures

If an error code persists after basic troubleshooting, a part might have failed. For example, a heating element might burn out. A drain pump motor could seize up. Sensors can malfunction, sending incorrect data.

Diagnosing these failures often requires specific tools, like a multimeter. It also demands a good understanding of electrical circuits. Replacing parts also requires specific instructions and often specialized tools. Always use genuine LG replacement parts if you decide to proceed with a DIY repair.

### Safety Precautions for DIY Repairs

Always unplug the dishwasher before attempting any internal checks or repairs. Turn off the circuit breaker for added safety. Water and electricity are a dangerous combination. Make sure your hands are dry.

Wear appropriate safety gear, such as gloves. Be aware of sharp edges inside the appliance. Do not force components if they are stuck. If you are uncomfortable or unsure at any point, stop.

### The Value of Professional Help

A professional appliance technician has the training and tools to diagnose complex problems. They can quickly identify faulty parts. They also have access to specific service manuals and diagnostic tools. This expertise is invaluable for difficult repairs.

If an error code indicates a control board issue, or if you cannot pinpoint the problem, call a professional. They ensure the repair is done correctly and safely. This often prevents more costly damage in the long run. Investing in professional service can extend your dishwasher's lifespan.

## Maintaining Your LG Dishwasher to Prevent Future Errors

Preventing errors is better than fixing them. Regular maintenance keeps your LG dishwasher running smoothly. It also extends its lifespan. Simple routine tasks can ward off many common error codes.

Taking good care of your dishwasher ensures it performs efficiently. It also saves you money on repairs. Make these maintenance tips part of your routine.

### Regular Cleaning: Filters and Spray Arms

The dishwasher filter is a crucial component. Food particles and grease collect there. A clogged filter restricts water flow and drainage. This can lead to OE or IE errors. Clean your filter regularly, at least once a month.

Remove the filter assembly from the bottom of the dishwasher. Rinse it under hot running water. Use a brush to scrub away any stubborn debris. The spray arms also need attention. Check their tiny holes for blockages. Use a toothpick or small wire to clear any obstructions. Clear spray arm holes ensure proper water distribution.

### Proper Loading Techniques

How you load your dishwasher impacts its performance. Overloading can block spray arms. This prevents water from reaching all dishes. It can also cause poor draining. Load dishes with space between them.

Avoid blocking the detergent dispenser. Large items should not obstruct the spray arms' rotation. Placing dishes properly ensures efficient washing and prevents water flow issues. This can help prevent errors related to water circulation.

### Using Correct Detergents and Rinse Aid

Always use dishwasher-specific detergent. Hand dish soap creates too many suds. Excessive suds can trigger the LE (leak) error by overflowing the leak pan. Use the recommended amount of detergent. More is not always better.

Rinse aid helps with drying and prevents water spots. It also helps water drain more effectively. Using rinse aid, especially in areas with hard water, can improve performance. It also reduces the likelihood of water-related errors.

### Water Hardness Considerations

Hard water can lead to mineral buildup inside your dishwasher. This buildup can clog spray arms, filters, and even internal components. Over time, it can affect heating elements and sensors. Limescale can reduce efficiency and cause errors.

If you have hard water, consider using a dishwasher cleaner regularly. Products designed to remove limescale can help. Some LG dishwashers have settings for water hardness. Adjusting this setting can optimize performance and prevent mineral buildup related issues.
