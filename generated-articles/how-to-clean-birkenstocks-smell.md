## How To Clean Birkenstocks Smell and Restore Freshness

Do your favorite Birkenstocks have an odor? Many people love Birkenstocks for their comfort and support. However, over time, the unique materials can develop an unpleasant smell. This happens often, but it does not mean you must throw away your beloved sandals.

I understand how frustrating a stinky pair of shoes can be. The good news is that you can effectively clean Birkenstocks smell. This guide will help you understand why the smell happens. We will then walk through simple steps and methods to eliminate odors. You will learn about different cleaning agents and natural remedies. I will also share tips to prevent future smells. By the end, your Birkenstocks will smell fresh again.

### Takeaway

To effectively clean Birkenstocks smell:
*   Identify the material of your footbed and straps.
*   Use a soft brush and mild cleaner on the footbed.
*   Apply baking soda to absorb moisture and odor.
*   Air dry your Birkenstocks completely, away from direct heat.
*   Store them in a cool, dry place when not in use.

### A Quick Fix for Smelly Birkenstocks

To clean Birkenstocks smell, gently brush the footbed to remove dirt. Sprinkle baking soda generously over the footbed. Let it sit overnight to absorb odors and moisture. Brush off the baking soda in the morning. This simple method helps neutralize the most common sources of Birkenstock odors.

## Understanding Why Birkenstocks Develop Odor

Birkenstocks are famous for their contoured cork footbeds. This design offers great support. However, these natural materials, especially the suede lining, can absorb sweat and skin oils. This creates a perfect environment for bacteria to grow. It is the bacteria that cause the unpleasant smell.

The footbed becomes a sponge for moisture. Our feet naturally sweat throughout the day. This moisture soaks into the suede and cork. Over time, bacteria feast on the sweat and dead skin cells. As bacteria multiply, they release waste products. These waste products are what we perceive as a bad smell. The porous nature of the materials makes them highly absorbent. This absorption makes Birkenstocks prone to odor if not cared for properly. It is a common problem, but one with solutions.

### The Role of Sweat and Bacteria

Our feet have many sweat glands. We sweat constantly, even if we do not notice it. This sweat contains water, salts, and oils. When we wear Birkenstocks, this sweat transfers to the footbed. The warm, dark environment inside the shoe is ideal for bacterial growth. These bacteria are naturally present on our skin.

Some common bacteria found on feet include *Brevibacterium* and *Staphylococcus*. When these bacteria break down sweat, they produce compounds like isovaleric acid. Isovaleric acid has a strong, cheesy, or pungent odor. This is the main culprit behind the bad smell in shoes. Regular cleaning helps remove these bacteria and their food source. Understanding this process helps us tackle the smell effectively.

### Material Absorbency and Odor Retention

Birkenstock footbeds have layers that contribute to absorbency. The top layer is usually suede. Suede is a type of leather with a soft, fuzzy surface. It feels comfortable underfoot. However, suede is very porous. It easily absorbs liquids, including sweat.

Below the suede is a cork layer. Cork is also a natural, porous material. It provides cushioning and support. While cork is durable, it can also absorb moisture. If moisture gets past the suede, it can penetrate the cork. Once absorbed, the moisture and bacteria become trapped within these layers. This makes the odor difficult to remove without specific cleaning methods. Synthetic Birkenstocks, like those made from EVA, are less absorbent. This makes them less prone to odor. However, most classic Birkenstocks have absorbent footbeds.

## Gathering Your Essential Cleaning Supplies

Before you start cleaning your Birkenstocks, gather everything you need. Having all your supplies ready makes the process smoother. You probably have many of these items already at home. I find that being prepared saves time and effort.

You will need a few basic tools and cleaning agents. These items are generally safe for Birkenstock materials. Always test any cleaner on a small, hidden area first. This ensures it will not damage or discolor your sandals. Let's make sure we have everything we need to tackle that smell.

### Essential Tools

*   **Soft-bristle brush:** A toothbrush or a suede brush works well. This helps dislodge dirt and refresh the suede.
*   **Old towel or cloth:** You will use this to wipe away residue and blot moisture.
*   **Small bowl:** For mixing cleaning solutions.

### Cleaning Agents for Odor Removal

*   **Baking soda:** A natural deodorizer and moisture absorber. It is safe for almost all materials.
*   **White vinegar:** A mild acid that kills bacteria and neutralizes odors. Mix it with water.
*   **Rubbing alcohol (optional):** Good for killing bacteria, but use sparingly on suede.
*   **Mild soap:** A small amount of dish soap or saddle soap can be used for general cleaning. Avoid harsh detergents.
*   **Birkenstock cleaner and conditioner kit (optional):** Birkenstock makes specific products. These are designed for their materials.

Remember, less is often more when cleaning delicate materials like suede and cork. Do not soak your Birkenstocks in water. Excessive moisture can damage the cork and adhesive. Our goal is to clean effectively without causing harm.

## Step-by-Step Cleaning of the Birkenstock Footbed

The footbed is the main culprit for odors. It needs the most attention. Cleaning the footbed carefully will significantly reduce or eliminate smells. This process focuses on removing sweat, dirt, and bacteria. I will guide you through each step for effective cleaning.

Always remember that Birkenstock footbeds are not meant to be submerged in water. We will use targeted cleaning methods. This protects the cork and glue from damage. Let's get your footbeds clean and fresh again.

### Pre-Cleaning: Preparing the Footbed

First, remove any loose dirt or debris from the footbed. You can use a stiff brush or a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment. This step helps expose the surface for deeper cleaning. I usually tap my Birkenstocks together to shake off large pieces of dirt.

Next, gently brush the suede footbed with a [suede brush](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-suede-birkenstocks) or a soft-bristle brush. Brush in one direction to lift the nap of the suede. This removes ingrained dirt and prepares the surface. It is like brushing your hair before washing it. This pre-cleaning sets the stage for a better result.

### Deep Cleaning with Baking Soda

Baking soda is a powerful, natural deodorizer. It absorbs odors and moisture. I often use it for many household cleaning tasks. For Birkenstocks, it is a game-changer.

1.  **Sprinkle generously:** After pre-cleaning, sprinkle a thick layer of baking soda over the entire suede footbed. Make sure to cover all areas that come into contact with your foot.
2.  **Let it sit:** Leave the baking soda on the footbed for at least 24 hours. For very strong odors, leave it for 48 hours or even longer. The longer it sits, the more odor it can absorb.
3.  **Brush off:** After the waiting period, use a soft brush to carefully brush off the baking soda. You can also vacuum it with a hose attachment. Most of the smell should be gone. This method is excellent for absorbing sweat and neutralizing acids from bacteria.

### Using White Vinegar for Tough Odors

White vinegar is another natural powerhouse. It is acidic, which helps kill odor-causing bacteria. It also neutralizes alkaline smells. Vinegar is especially useful for very persistent odors or signs of light mildew.

1.  **Mix solution:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. For example, half a cup of vinegar and half a cup of water.
2.  **Lightly mist:** Lightly mist the footbed with the vinegar solution. Do not saturate it. A light spray is all you need. Focus on the areas with the worst smell.
3.  **Wipe and dry:** Immediately wipe the footbed with a clean, damp cloth. Then, use a dry towel to blot away excess moisture. Let the Birkenstocks air dry completely in a well-ventilated area. The vinegar smell will dissipate as it dries. This method is effective for getting rid of smells that cling deep within the material.

### Cleaning the Cork and Outer Soles

While the footbed holds most of the smell, do not forget the cork and outer soles. Cleaning these parts helps maintain the overall hygiene of your Birkenstocks. It also keeps them looking good. I always make sure to give these areas a quick clean too.

The cork needs gentle care. The outer soles, often made of EVA, are quite durable. This step ensures all parts of your Birkenstock contribute to a fresh and clean appearance. It prevents dirt from migrating back to the footbed.

#### Protecting the Cork Sole

The cork sole is the heart of a Birkenstock. It provides comfort and support. However, it is also sensitive to moisture and abrasion. The cork usually has a sealant to protect it. Over time, this sealant can wear off.

1.  **Wipe gently:** Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exposed cork edges. Remove any visible dirt. Do not scrub hard.
2.  **Inspect sealant:** Check the cork for any cracks or dullness. If the sealant looks worn, you can reapply a cork sealer. Birkenstock sells its own brand of cork sealer. This protects the cork from moisture and keeps it flexible. Regular sealing extends the life of your Birkenstocks.

#### Cleaning the Outer Soles

The outer soles of Birkenstocks are typically made of EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate). This material is lightweight and flexible. It is also durable and easy to clean.

1.  **Wipe with damp cloth:** Use a damp cloth with a little mild soap to wipe down the outer soles. You can scrub more vigorously here than on the footbed.
2.  **Rinse and dry:** Wipe off any soap residue with a clean, damp cloth. Then, let the soles air dry. The EVA material dries quickly. Cleaning the outer soles prevents tracked-in dirt from reaching the footbed. It also keeps your Birkenstocks looking tidy.

## Natural Remedies for Ongoing Odor Elimination

Sometimes, cleaning is not enough for persistent odors. Or, you might want to maintain freshness between deep cleans. Natural remedies offer gentle, effective solutions for ongoing odor elimination. They are safe and often readily available.

I prefer natural options whenever possible. They avoid harsh chemicals and are better for the environment. These methods are simple to use. They help keep your Birkenstocks smelling fresh without constant scrubbing. Let's explore some great natural approaches.

### Sunlight: A Natural Deodorizer

Sunlight is a fantastic natural deodorizer and disinfectant. UV rays from the sun kill bacteria and reduce moisture. I use this method often for many items, not just shoes.

1.  **Place in direct sun:** Find a spot where your Birkenstocks can sit in direct sunlight. Choose a dry day.
2.  **Time it right:** Leave them in the sun for a few hours. I usually aim for 2-4 hours. Do not leave them out for too long, especially on very hot days. Excessive heat can dry out the cork or cause the adhesive to weaken.
3.  **Flip them:** Turn the Birkenstocks over halfway through. This ensures both sides of the footbed get sun exposure. Sunlight helps evaporate residual moisture. It also kills odor-causing bacteria. This is one of the easiest and most effective natural ways to freshen shoes.

### Essential Oils for a Fresh Scent

Essential oils can add a pleasant scent and offer some antibacterial properties. They do not eliminate the root cause of the smell, but they can make your Birkenstocks smell better. Use them sparingly.

1.  **Choose your oil:** Tea tree oil, lavender oil, or peppermint oil are good choices. Tea tree oil has natural antibacterial qualities. Lavender and peppermint offer fresh scents.
2.  **Dilute if needed:** Mix a few drops of essential oil with a small amount of rubbing alcohol or water in a spray bottle. Alcohol helps the oil spread and evaporate.
3.  **Lightly mist:** Lightly mist the footbed from a distance. Do not saturate the suede. Just a few spritzes are enough.
4.  **Air dry:** Allow the Birkenstocks to air dry completely. The essential oil scent will remain, covering any lingering odors. This method is great for a quick refresh between wears. Be careful not to use too much oil, as it can stain the suede.

## Addressing Stubborn Odors and Mold

Sometimes, regular cleaning and natural remedies are not enough. Stubborn odors might indicate a deeper problem. Mold or mildew can develop if Birkenstocks are stored in damp conditions. These issues need a more targeted approach.

Dealing with mold requires caution. Mold can damage materials and pose health risks. I will explain how to tackle these tougher challenges. This ensures your Birkenstocks are not just smell-free but also hygienically clean.

### When to Use Rubbing Alcohol

Rubbing alcohol is a strong disinfectant. It effectively kills bacteria and fungi. Use it cautiously on Birkenstocks, especially on suede. It can dry out leather or affect dyes if overused.

1.  **Spot test:** Always test a small, inconspicuous area first. This checks for discoloration or damage.
2.  **Dampen a cloth:** Lightly dampen a clean cloth or cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Do not pour alcohol directly onto the footbed.
3.  **Wipe the footbed:** Gently wipe the suede footbed with the alcohol-dampened cloth. Focus on areas with strong odor.
4.  **Air dry:** Allow the Birkenstocks to air dry completely. The alcohol evaporates quickly. This method is good for targeting specific, very smelly spots. It should be used sparingly as a last resort for odor.

### Tackling Mold and Mildew

Mold and mildew produce a musty smell. They also appear as dark spots or fuzzy growth. If you see mold on your Birkenstocks, act quickly. Mold can degrade materials over time. For more general advice on dealing with mold on footwear, you can refer to our guide on [how to clean mold off shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes).

1.  **Wear gloves:** Protect your hands.
2.  **Brush off dry mold:** Take the Birkenstocks outside. Use a stiff brush to gently brush off any visible mold growth. This prevents mold spores from spreading indoors.
3.  **Vinegar solution:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water.
4.  **Damp wipe:** Lightly dampen a cloth with the vinegar solution. Carefully wipe down the affected areas of the footbed and straps. Vinegar kills mold spores.
5.  **Sunlight exposure:** Place the Birkenstocks in direct sunlight for several hours. UV rays help kill remaining mold and dry out the moisture.
6.  **Ensure complete drying:** Make sure the Birkenstocks are completely dry before storing them. Any residual moisture can cause mold to return. For severe mold, professional cleaning might be necessary. It is crucial to address mold quickly to preserve your Birkenstocks.

## Caring for Different Birkenstock Materials

Birkenstocks come in various materials beyond the classic suede and cork. Knowing how to care for these different materials is important. This ensures longevity and helps prevent odor specific to their type. My approach changes slightly depending on the material.

The strategies for the footbed remain similar. However, the upper materials (straps) require specific attention. This section will cover common Birkenstock strap materials. Proper care for all parts of your Birkenstocks contributes to overall freshness. You can also explore our general guide on [how to clean inside of Birkenstocks](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-inside-of-birkenstocks) for comprehensive internal cleaning tips.

### Leather and Birko-Flor Straps

Many Birkenstocks feature leather or Birko-Flor straps. Birko-Flor is a synthetic, skin-friendly material developed by Birkenstock. Both materials are relatively easy to clean.

*   **Leather Straps:**
    1.  **Wipe with damp cloth:** Use a slightly damp cloth to wipe down leather straps. For stubborn dirt, add a tiny drop of mild soap.
    2.  **Condition (optional):** After cleaning and drying, you can apply a leather conditioner. This keeps the leather supple and prevents cracking. I use a small amount of leather conditioner on my leather sandals. Our article on [how to clean oiled leather Birkenstocks](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-oiled-leather-birkenstocks) offers more detailed advice for specific leather types.
*   **Birko-Flor Straps:**
    1.  **Wipe clean:** Birko-Flor is very easy to clean. Simply wipe it with a damp cloth. You can use a bit of mild soap if needed.
    2.  **Air dry:** Allow to air dry. Birko-Flor is water-resistant. This makes it a low-maintenance material.

Avoid saturating either material. Always wipe away excess moisture immediately.

### EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate) Models

Birkenstock also offers models made entirely from EVA. These are lightweight, waterproof, and very durable. They are perfect for beach or pool use. Odor is less of a concern with EVA because it does not absorb moisture like cork and suede.

*   **Easy to clean:** You can simply rinse EVA Birkenstocks under water. Use a mild soap and a brush to scrub any dirt.
*   **Quick dry:** They dry very quickly. This makes them resistant to bacterial growth and associated odors. I love how low-maintenance these models are. While less prone to smell, keeping them clean ensures hygiene.

## Prevention is Key: Keeping Birkenstocks Fresh Long-Term

Cleaning stinky Birkenstocks is one thing. Preventing them from smelling in the first place is even better. Long-term care and good habits significantly reduce the likelihood of odor. I always tell people that prevention is the best medicine for shoe odors.

These tips will help you maintain the freshness of your Birkenstocks. They will also extend their lifespan. Incorporating these simple practices into your routine will make a big difference. Let's keep those Birkenstocks smelling clean every day.

### Rotating Your Footwear

Wearing the same pair of shoes every day does not allow them to fully dry out. This constant moisture encourages bacterial growth. Rotating your footwear is a simple yet effective strategy.

*   **Give them a break:** Have at least two pairs of Birkenstocks, or other sandals, that you can alternate.
*   **Allow to dry:** When you take off your Birkenstocks, let them air out for at least 24 hours. This allows any absorbed sweat to evaporate completely. I always rotate my shoes. This simple habit keeps all my footwear much fresher.

### Proper Drying Methods

Proper drying is critical for preventing odor. Moisture is the biggest friend of odor-causing bacteria. Incorrect drying can trap moisture.

*   **Air dry naturally:** After wearing or cleaning, always air dry your Birkenstocks. Place them in a well-ventilated area. A shady spot outdoors or near an open window indoors is ideal.
*   **Avoid direct heat:** Do not place them in direct sunlight for prolonged periods, near radiators, or use a hairdryer. Extreme heat can dry out the cork, causing it to crack. It can also weaken the adhesive, leading to damage.
*   **Stuff with newspaper (optional):** If they got very wet, you can stuff the footbeds with crumpled newspaper. Newspaper absorbs moisture effectively. Change the newspaper every few hours until dry.

### Using Deodorizing Inserts or Sprays

For ongoing freshness, deodorizing products can be helpful. They absorb moisture or neutralize odors.

*   **Cedar shoe trees:** Cedar has natural moisture-absorbing and deodorizing properties. Place cedar shoe trees or balls in your Birkenstocks when not wearing them.
*   **Deodorizing sprays:** Use a shoe deodorizer spray designed for footwear. Many natural options exist. Spray lightly on the footbed after each wear. I find these very useful for an instant refresh.
*   **Baking soda sachets:** Fill small fabric bags or old socks with baking soda. Place one in each Birkenstock overnight. This acts as a continuous odor absorber. These simple methods go a long way in keeping your Birkenstocks fresh.

### Foot Hygiene Matters

Ultimately, the smell comes from your feet. Maintaining good foot hygiene directly impacts how quickly your Birkenstocks develop an odor.

*   **Wash your feet:** Wash your feet daily with soap and water. Dry them thoroughly, especially between the toes.
*   **Antiperspirant/deodorant for feet:** Consider using an antiperspirant or deodorant specifically for feet if you have excessively sweaty feet.
*   **Wear socks (sometimes):** While not everyone wears socks with Birkenstocks, thin cotton socks can absorb sweat. This prevents it from soaking into the footbed. This is especially useful during hotter months or for long walks. Taking care of your feet helps your Birkenstocks stay clean.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Birkenstocks Smell

### Why do my Birkenstocks smell so bad?
Your Birkenstocks smell bad mainly because of sweat and bacteria. The footbed, usually made of absorbent suede and cork, traps moisture from your feet. This creates a warm, damp environment. Bacteria on your skin break down the sweat, producing compounds that cause the strong, unpleasant odor. Regular cleaning and proper drying help prevent this bacterial buildup.

### Can I wash Birkenstocks in the washing machine?
No, you should not wash classic Birkenstocks in a washing machine. The natural cork footbed and leather or suede materials are not designed for machine washing. Machine washing can damage the cork, dissolve adhesives, and dry out the leather. This leads to cracking and breakage. Only the all-EVA Birkenstock models are waterproof and can be rinsed under a tap.

### How often should I clean my Birkenstocks?
The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you wear them and how much your feet sweat. For daily wear, I recommend a quick deodorizing treatment, like baking soda, weekly. A more thorough footbed cleaning should be done monthly or every few months. Deep cleaning is necessary when you notice a persistent odor.

### What is the best way to deodorize Birkenstocks naturally?
The best natural way to deodorize Birkenstocks is by using baking soda. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the footbed. Leave it overnight to absorb moisture and odors. Brush it off in the morning. Sunlight also works as a natural disinfectant and deodorizer. Exposing them to direct sunlight for a few hours helps kill bacteria and dry out the footbed.

### Can I use hydrogen peroxide on Birkenstocks?
It is not recommended to use hydrogen peroxide on Birkenstocks. While it can kill bacteria and mold, it is a strong oxidizer. It can bleach or discolor the suede and potentially damage the cork or adhesive. Stick to milder, safer alternatives like white vinegar or rubbing alcohol diluted with water for deep cleaning and disinfection.

### Does Birkenstock make a cleaning kit?
Yes, Birkenstock offers its own cleaning and care kit. This kit typically includes a brush, a cleaner, and a cork sealer. These products are formulated specifically for Birkenstock's materials. Using their dedicated kit ensures compatibility and effective cleaning. It helps maintain the integrity of your sandals while addressing odors.
