## The Importance of Hot Water in Dishwashing

Hot water is very important for proper dishwashing. It does more than just make dishes feel warm. Hot water helps in several key ways. First, it melts grease and oily residues. These substances become liquid at higher temperatures. This makes them easier for detergent to remove. Cold water struggles to break down these tough stains.

Second, hot water helps detergents work better. Most dishwasher detergents are designed to be active in hot water. The heat helps the chemical compounds in the detergent dissolve fully. This allows them to effectively break down food particles. This means a more efficient cleaning action.

Third, hot water provides sanitization. Many LG dishwashers offer a "Sanitize" cycle. This cycle heats water to a very high temperature. This high heat kills bacteria and other germs on your dishes. It helps keep your family safe from foodborne illnesses. For those concerned about germ removal, this is a vital function. You can learn more about how LG dishwashers ensure sanitation. For example, some models include specific features to help with this process.

Lastly, hot water aids in the drying process. After the wash and rinse cycles, the dishes are very hot. This residual heat helps the water evaporate quickly. It reduces the need for extra drying elements. This is why dishes often come out dry and spot-free. When dishes remain wet, it can be a sign of insufficient heat during the final rinse. If you notice your LG dishwasher is not drying well, the heating element might be part of the issue.

The presence of effective water heating ensures that your LG dishwasher performs at its best. It delivers clean, sanitized, and dry dishes. This makes hot water a fundamental part of the dishwashing process. It is not just a luxury. It is a cleaning necessity.

Most modern dishwashers use similar heating elements.

## Factors Affecting Water Heating Performance

Several things can affect how well your LG dishwasher heats water. Knowing these factors helps you keep your dishwasher working its best.

First, the **inlet water temperature** matters. Your dishwasher takes water from your home's hot water supply. If this water is not hot enough, the dishwasher has to work harder to raise the temperature. It may take longer for the cycle to finish. Or, the dishwasher might not reach the desired temperature. It is good to run your kitchen faucet hot for a minute before starting the dishwasher. This brings hot water closer to the appliance. You might also be asking yourself: [Does LG dishwasher need hot water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/does-lg-dishwasher-need-hot-water)? While it does have its own heater, a good hot water supply helps.

Second, **hard water** can impact heating. Hard water has many minerals. These minerals can build up on the heating element. This build-up is called scale. Scale acts as an insulator. It makes it harder for the heating element to transfer heat to the water. This can lower heating efficiency. It can also lead to more energy use. Regular cleaning helps reduce scale build-up. You can learn more about how to [clean an LG dishwasher](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-an-lg-dishwasher) to keep its components clear.

Third, **heating element issues** can cause problems. The heating element can wear out over time. It can also get damaged. If the element fails, your dishwasher will not heat water. Dishes will come out cold and often still wet. You might also notice a burning smell. This indicates a serious problem. A faulty thermostat can also prevent proper heating. The thermostat senses water temperature. If it is broken, it may not tell the element to turn on.

Fourth, **user settings and cycle selection** play a role. If you choose a "Light" or "Quick" cycle, the dishwasher may not heat water as much. These cycles are designed for speed, not maximum heat. Make sure you select the right cycle for your needs. Use "Sanitize" or "High Temp Wash" for maximum heat.

Understanding these factors helps you troubleshoot heating problems. It also helps you maintain your LG dishwasher. Proper care ensures long-lasting performance.
