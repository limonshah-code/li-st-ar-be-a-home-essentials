### Clear, Concise Answer

To replace an LG dishwasher heating element, first disconnect power and water. Then, access the element by removing the lower rack and sump cover. Disconnect wires and mounting nuts, remove the old element, install the new one, and reassemble. Finally, reconnect utilities and test the dishwasher.

### Identifying a Failing LG Dishwasher Heating Element

When your LG dishwasher stops heating water properly, the heating element often takes the blame. You might notice dishes come out cold after a wash cycle. This is a clear indicator of a heating issue. Another sign is dishes remaining wet, even after the drying cycle completes. The element helps with evaporation, so its failure affects drying performance.

Sometimes, your dishwasher might display an error code related to heating. Consult your LG owner's manual for specific codes. You might also see visible signs of damage on the element itself. Look for cracks, breaks, or burn marks. These visual cues suggest the element has failed.

To confirm the heating element's failure, you can use a multimeter. Disconnect power to the dishwasher first. Access the heating element and disconnect its wires. Set your multimeter to the ohms (Î©) setting. Touch the probes to the terminals of the heating element. A reading close to zero or infinity (OL or open circuit) indicates a bad element. A good element should show continuity, typically between 10 and 30 ohms. Checking the resistance confirms if the element can complete an electrical circuit. This simple test pinpoints the problem accurately.

### Essential Tools and Safety Precautions for LG Dishwasher Repair

Before you begin any appliance repair, gathering the right tools is crucial. You will need a few basic items from your toolbox. A Phillips head screwdriver and a flathead screwdriver are essential for various fasteners. A nut driver set, or a socket set, will help you remove the nuts securing the heating element. You may also need pliers, especially needle-nose pliers, for disconnecting wires. Don't forget your multimeter to confirm the diagnosis and test the new part.

The most important "tool" is safety. Always disconnect the power to your LG dishwasher before you start working. You can do this by unplugging the unit from the wall outlet. If it is hardwired, flip the corresponding circuit breaker in your home's electrical panel. Failing to do this can lead to electric shock. Next, shut off the water supply to the dishwasher. Look for the shut-off valve under your sink or near the dishwasher supply line. This prevents leaks when you disconnect water lines.

Wearing work gloves can protect your hands from sharp edges or grime. It is also wise to have a towel or small bucket nearby. This helps catch any residual water when disconnecting hoses. Keeping your work area clean and well-lit is also beneficial. Proper preparation ensures a smooth and safe repair process.

### Accessing the LG Dishwasher's Heating Element

To reach the heating element, you must first prepare the dishwasher. Begin by unplugging the unit from its power source or turning off the circuit breaker. This step cannot be stressed enough for safety. Next, shut off the water supply valve connected to the dishwasher. Disconnect the water supply line and drain hose from your plumbing under the sink. Have a towel ready for any drips.

Carefully pull the dishwasher out from its cabinet enclosure. You might need to unscrew mounting brackets securing it to the countertop. Gently slide the unit forward. This gives you room to work. Once the dishwasher is out, lay it on its back or side. This provides easier access to the underside where the heating element connections are often located.

Inside the dishwasher tub, you need to remove the lower dish rack. Lift it out and set it aside. Then, remove the lower spray arm. It usually unscrews or clips into place. After the spray arm, locate and remove the filter assembly. This typically involves twisting and lifting. Finally, remove the sump cover or wash arm manifold. This often involves unscrewing a few fasteners or unlatching clips. Once these components are clear, the heating element will be fully visible at the bottom of the wash tub. Sometimes, the element is secured from the underside of the dishwasher, requiring access from below.

### Detaching and Removing the Old Heating Element

With the lower rack, spray arm, and sump cover removed, you will clearly see the heating element at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It looks like a U-shaped or coiled metal rod. First, locate the electrical wires connected to its terminals. These are usually at the front or back of the element, often underneath the dishwasher tub. You might need to tilt the dishwasher or access it from the front through the kick panel area.

Carefully disconnect these wires. They are often spade connectors that pull straight off the terminals. Use pliers if they are stuck. Make sure to note which wire goes to which terminal, though they are usually interchangeable for heating elements. Some models might have specific wire colors or positions, so taking a picture can be helpful.

Next, you must unsecure the heating element from the dishwasher tub. LG heating elements are typically held in place by two nuts or mounting screws from the underside of the dishwasher. You will need to access these from below the appliance. Use a nut driver or socket wrench to loosen and remove these nuts. Sometimes, there are also rubber grommets or clips holding the element in place from inside the tub. Gently push the element down through these grommets. Once the nuts and any internal clips are free, you can carefully lift the old heating element out of the dishwasher tub. Be gentle to avoid damaging the tub or other internal components.

### Installing the New LG Dishwasher Heating Element

Now that you have removed the old heating element, it is time to install the new one. Start by carefully positioning the new U-shaped heating element into the openings at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Ensure the two terminal ends poke through the holes correctly. These holes often have rubber grommets, which help seal the element and prevent leaks. Make sure the element sits flush against the bottom of the tub.

From underneath the dishwasher, secure the heating element. Thread the mounting nuts onto the terminal posts that protrude through the bottom of the tub. Tighten these nuts securely with your nut driver or socket wrench. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the terminals or the tub. The goal is a snug fit that prevents leaks and keeps the element stable.

Finally, reconnect the electrical wires to the terminals on the new heating element. Ensure the connections are firm and secure. A loose connection can cause poor performance or even be a fire hazard. Double-check that all wires are properly seated. Once the element is secured and wired, you are ready to reassemble the dishwasher's interior components.

### Reassembling and Testing Your LG Dishwasher

With the new heating element installed, you can begin putting your LG dishwasher back together. Start by reinstalling the sump cover or wash arm manifold. Make sure it clicks or screws into place securely. Next, replace the filter assembly; twist it until it locks. Reinstall the lower spray arm, ensuring it spins freely when you manually turn it. Finally, place the lower dish rack back into its designated position inside the tub.

Carefully slide the dishwasher back into its cabinet opening. Reattach any mounting brackets that secure it to the countertop. Ensure the dishwasher is level. Then, reconnect the water supply line and the drain hose to your household plumbing. Double-check all connections for tightness to prevent leaks.

Now, restore power to the dishwasher. Plug it back into the wall outlet or flip the circuit breaker back on. Before running a full cycle with dishes, run a short test cycle without soap. This allows you to check for any leaks around the heating element connections or water lines. It also confirms the heating element is functioning correctly. Listen for proper operation and feel for heat inside the tub. If everything looks good and the water heats up, your repair is successful.

### Pro Tips for Extending Your Dishwasher's Heating Element Life

Replacing a heating element can be a hassle, so taking steps to extend its life makes sense. Regular cleaning is crucial. Food particles and mineral deposits can accumulate on the heating element over time. This buildup can make the element work harder, leading to premature failure. Periodically clean your dishwasher, including the filter and spray arms. You can also run an empty cycle with a dishwasher cleaner designed to remove mineral deposits. This prevents scale from forming on the element.

Using the correct amount and type of detergent also plays a role. Too much detergent can create excessive suds, which may interfere with proper water circulation and heating. Using a high-quality, low-phosphate detergent is best. Avoid overloading your dishwasher. When dishes are packed too tightly, water and heat cannot circulate properly, making the heating element work harder to dry the load. This extra strain reduces its lifespan.

Finally, be mindful of what you place on the bottom rack, especially near the heating element. Plastic items can melt and stick to the hot element. This not only damages the plastic but also creates a residue on the element that can cause it to overheat or short circuit. Always place plastic items on the top rack or away from the heating element. Following these simple maintenance tips can significantly prolong the life of your LG dishwasher's heating element and ensure consistently hot and dry dishes. Sometimes, heating issues can stem from other appliance parts; for instance, understanding [why is my LG oven not heating up](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-is-my-lg-oven-not-heating-up) provides broader context on troubleshooting heating problems in LG appliances.
