## Retrieve That Coin: How To Remove a Coin From Your Samsung Washing Machine

Has your Samsung washing machine started making a strange clanking or grinding noise during cycles? You might have an unwelcome guest: a coin. Coins often escape pockets and end up in places they do not belong. They can cause real damage to your appliance.

Discovering a coin inside your washing machine is a common problem. It can lead to expensive repairs if left unchecked. This comprehensive guide will show you how to safely remove a coin from your Samsung washing machine. We cover everything from initial safety steps to specific removal techniques for different models. You will also learn valuable tips to prevent this issue from happening again. Let us get your washer back to quiet, efficient operation.

### Takeaway

Removing a coin from your Samsung washing machine requires careful steps.
*   Always disconnect power and water first.
*   Check common areas like the gasket, drain pump filter, and drum.
*   Use simple tools like a flashlight and pliers.
*   Call a professional for deeply stuck coins.
*   Prevent future incidents by checking pockets before washing.

### Clear Answer

To remove a coin from a Samsung washing machine, first disconnect power and water. Then, check the drum gasket (front-load) or agitator area (top-load). Most often, coins lodge in the drain pump filter, located behind a small access panel at the bottom front. Open, drain, and clear the filter.

## Prioritize Safety: Before You Begin Coin Removal

Safety is always the first step when working with any home appliance. Your Samsung washing machine uses both electricity and water. Ignoring proper safety steps can lead to electric shock or water damage. Please follow these guidelines carefully before you try to remove a coin from your washing machine.

First, you must completely disconnect the power. Locate your washing machine's power cord. Pull the plug directly from the wall outlet. This stops all electrical flow to the machine. Never attempt any work on the washer while it is plugged in. Electricity can cause severe injury.

Next, shut off the water supply. There are two water hoses connected to the back of your washing machine. Each hose has a valve where it connects to the wall. Turn both valves clockwise until they are fully closed. This stops water from flowing into your machine. It prevents any accidental leaks during the repair process.

It is also wise to prepare for any residual water. Keep a few towels or a shallow pan nearby. The drain pump filter often holds a small amount of water. You might also want to wear gloves. This keeps your hands clean and safe. Following these steps ensures your safety as you proceed with the coin removal. A safe start makes for a successful repair.

This knowledge helps prevent water spills during repairs.

## Identifying the Culprit: Where Coins Often Hide in Samsung Washers

Coins can end up in several places inside your Samsung washing machine. Knowing where to look saves you time and effort. The most common hiding spots depend on your washer type. Front-load and top-load machines have different internal designs. Understanding these locations helps you find the coin quickly.

For front-load Samsung washing machines, the most common spot is the door gasket. This is the large rubber seal around the door opening. Small items like coins often fall into its folds. They get trapped there during the wash cycle. Carefully inspect this area first. Run your fingers along the inside of the gasket. Look for any foreign objects.

Another very common area for coins is the drain pump filter. This filter captures lint, small objects, and debris before water drains out. Samsung washing machines usually have this filter located at the bottom front. It is behind a small access panel or door. This is often called a "coin trap" because it catches coins so well. Many people wonder [where is the coin trap on a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-coin-trap-on-a-washing-machine), and on Samsung models, it's typically in this accessible spot.

For top-load Samsung washing machines, coins might get stuck differently. They can fall under the agitator or impeller at the bottom of the drum. Sometimes, they slip between the inner and outer drums. This makes them harder to reach. The drain pump filter is still a likely place for top-loaders as well. Always start with the easiest and most common areas first. A thorough inspection will reveal the coin's location.

## Step-by-Step: Removing a Coin from Your Samsung Front-Load Washer

Removing a coin from a Samsung front-load washing machine often involves checking two main areas. The door gasket and the drain pump filter are the most common spots. Follow these steps for a smooth removal process. Remember to always ensure the power is off and water supply is disconnected before you begin.

First, open the washing machine door. Carefully inspect the rubber gasket around the door. This is also known as the bellows. Use a flashlight to look into all the folds and crevices of the gasket. Small items like coins, buttons, or even small socks often get trapped here. If you see the coin, use your fingers or a pair of needle-nose pliers to gently pull it out. Be careful not to tear the rubber. Learning [how to remove Samsung washing machine gasket](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-samsung-washing-machine-gasket) can be helpful if the coin is stuck deep, but often, it's not necessary for simple coin removal.

If the coin is not in the gasket, the next place to check is the drain pump filter. This filter is usually located at the bottom front of your Samsung washing machine. Look for a small square or rectangular access panel. You might need a flat-head screwdriver to gently pry it open. Once open, you will see a small hose and a large cap.

Place a shallow pan and towels under this area. Unscrew the small cap on the drain hose first. Let any residual water drain into the pan. This prevents a mess. Once the water stops, slowly unscrew the larger filter cap. Turn it counter-clockwise. Be ready for more water to come out. Pull the filter out carefully. Inspect it for the coin and any other debris. Remove the coin and thoroughly clean the filter before reinserting it. This process is very similar to [how to clean Samsung washing machine filter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-samsung-washing-machine-filter), which should be done regularly anyway.

After removing the coin and cleaning the filter, screw the filter cap back on tightly. Close the small drain hose cap. Secure the access panel. Reconnect the water supply and power. Run a quick rinse-and-spin cycle to check for leaks and ensure proper operation.

## Step-by-Step: Retrieving a Coin from Your Samsung Top-Load Washer

Retrieving a coin from a Samsung top-load washing machine can be different from a front-loader. Top-load washers do not have a door gasket that collects items in the same way. However, coins can still fall into various parts of the machine. The main areas to check include the drum and the drain pump filter.

First, visually inspect the washing machine drum. Look closely at the bottom, especially around the agitator or impeller. If your machine has an agitator, coins might fall beneath it. If it has an impeller, they could slip into the small gaps. Use a flashlight to get a good view. Sometimes, you can see the coin sitting at the very bottom of the drum or just under the lip. If visible and reachable, use a pair of long-nose pliers or grabbers to carefully retrieve the coin.

If you cannot see the coin, or if it is out of reach, the next step is to check the drain pump filter. Many Samsung top-load washing machines also feature a drain pump filter. This is similar to front-load models. This filter is designed to catch small objects and lint before they clog the drain pump. The location of this filter can vary slightly by model. It is usually found at the bottom front or side of the machine, behind an access panel. You can refer to your user manual for the exact location on your specific Samsung model. For general understanding, you can research [where is the coin trap on a washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/where-is-the-coin-trap-on-a-washing-machine).

To access the drain pump filter:
1.  **Locate the access panel:** It is typically a small rectangular door near the bottom of the washer.
2.  **Open the panel:** You might need a flat-head screwdriver to pry it open gently.
3.  **Prepare for water:** Place towels and a shallow pan underneath the opening.
4.  **Drain residual water:** Locate a small drain hose with a cap. Pull it out and unscrew the cap to let water drain.
5.  **Remove the filter:** Once water stops, slowly unscrew the larger filter cap by turning it counter-clockwise. Pull the filter out.
6.  **Inspect and clean:** Look for the coin and any other debris. Remove them. Clean the filter thoroughly under running water.
7.  **Reassemble:** Screw the filter back in tightly. Replace the small drain hose cap. Close the access panel.

After reassembly, reconnect the water lines and power. Run a quick test cycle (like a rinse and spin) to ensure everything works correctly and there are no leaks.

## What to Do If the Coin is Stuck Deeper Inside

Sometimes, a coin might not be in the easy-to-reach places like the gasket or drain pump filter. It can get lodged deeper inside your Samsung washing machine. This situation is more challenging. It might require more advanced steps or professional help. Do not attempt complex disassemblies if you are not comfortable.

If you have checked the gasket and the drain pump filter without success, the coin might be between the inner and outer drums. It could also be stuck in the drain hose or the pump itself. You might hear the coin rattling during the spin cycle, but cannot pinpoint its exact location. This indicates it is still within the machine's system. Continuing to run the machine with a deeply stuck coin can cause significant damage. It could puncture hoses, damage the pump impeller, or even harm the drum.

Before calling a professional, you can try one more thing. Carefully tilt the washing machine forward or backward slightly. Sometimes gravity can shift the coin. It might move into a more accessible position. Have someone help you with this. The machine is heavy. Be careful not to strain yourself or damage the floor. Listen for any movement of the coin. If you hear it move, try checking the drain pump filter again.

If the coin remains elusive or you are unsure about disassembling parts of your machine, it is best to call a qualified appliance technician. They have the tools and expertise to safely open up the machine. They can pinpoint the exact location of the coin. They can also check for any damage the coin might have already caused. Attempting to force parts or disassemble complex components without proper knowledge can lead to further damage. This would result in more costly repairs. Sometimes, a simple issue can turn into a big one. Knowing when to call a professional saves you trouble. If your Samsung washing machine is acting strangely, like having [no water why samsung washing machine no water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-samsung-washing-machine-no-water), a deeper obstruction could be the cause.

## Maintaining Your Samsung Washer: Preventing Future Coin Incidents

Preventing coins from entering your Samsung washing machine is much easier than removing them. Simple habits can save you time, effort, and potential repair costs. Regular maintenance and careful preparation before each wash cycle are key.

The most important step is to always check pockets. Before putting any clothes into the washing machine, take a moment to empty all pockets. This includes jeans, jackets, shirts, and even small children's clothing. Make it a routine for everyone in your household. A quick pat down or visual check prevents many issues. This simple habit is the best defense against foreign objects in your washer.

Consider using mesh laundry bags for small items. These bags are great for delicate clothing. They also work well for items that might contain small objects. Think about socks, handkerchiefs, or any clothing with small attachments. Placing these items in a mesh bag ensures that if a coin somehow escapes a pocket, it stays contained within the bag. It will not enter the washing machine's internal parts.

Regularly clean your washing machine's drain pump filter. Even if you are careful, some small debris will always get through. This filter is designed to catch them. Most manufacturers recommend cleaning it every few months. This prevents build-up and ensures the filter can do its job. A clean filter is more effective at trapping coins. You can learn more about general upkeep by reading [how to clean Samsung washing machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-samsung-washing-machine). This practice helps your machine run efficiently and prevents common issues.

Educate your family members about these simple prevention methods. Make sure everyone understands why checking pockets is important. Explain the potential damage a coin can cause. When everyone is on board, you significantly reduce the risk of future coin incidents. A little prevention goes a long way in maintaining your appliance.

## Testing Your Washing Machine After Coin Removal

After you successfully remove a coin from your Samsung washing machine, you need to test it. This step confirms that the machine is working properly. It also ensures that no new issues have arisen during the repair. Testing helps you catch any problems before they become bigger.

First, ensure everything is put back together correctly. Double-check that the drain pump filter cap is screwed on tightly. Confirm the small drain hose cap is secure. Make sure any access panels are closed firmly. Reconnect the water supply lines. Turn the water valves back to the open position. Finally, plug the washing machine back into the power outlet.

Now, run a short test cycle. A "rinse and spin" cycle is usually sufficient. This cycle uses water and activates the drain pump. It allows you to observe the machine's operation. Pay close attention during this test run.

Listen carefully for any unusual noises. The original clanking or grinding sound should be gone. If you hear new or strange noises, the coin might not have been the only issue. Or, it could indicate another foreign object is still inside. It could also mean something was not reassembled correctly.

Check for leaks. Look under and around the machine throughout the test cycle. Pay special attention to the drain pump filter area and hose connections. Any drips or puddles mean a leak. If you find a leak, immediately unplug the machine and turn off the water. Then, re-examine the connections and caps for tightness.

Observe the draining process. The water should drain efficiently and quietly. If water drains slowly or the pump sounds strained, there might still be an obstruction. Or, the pump itself could have been damaged by the coin. If your machine showed error codes before, check if they are gone. If it's still not draining correctly or showing issues like [why Samsung washing machine no water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-samsung-washing-machine-no-water) after coin removal, consult your manual or a technician.

Once the test cycle finishes successfully, without strange noises or leaks, your Samsung washing machine is ready for normal use again. This final check ensures peace of mind and confirms your repair.
