## Understanding Why Your LG Washer Won't Drain

Your LG washing machine should drain water after each cycle. When it does not, a problem exists. Several common reasons explain why your LG washer won't drain. Understanding these causes helps you fix the issue faster. You can pinpoint the problem with basic checks.

### Clogged Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter catches lint, coins, and small items. Over time, these items build up. This buildup clogs the filter. A clogged filter stops water from draining properly. It is the most frequent cause of drainage issues. Many users neglect to clean this filter. Cleaning it regularly prevents most problems.

### Kinked or Blocked Drain Hose

Your washing machine's drain hose moves water out. If this hose gets kinked, water cannot flow. The hose can also get blocked internally. Lint or other debris builds up inside the hose. Check behind your machine for kinks. Feel the hose for blockages. Sometimes, the hose connection to the drain pipe can be too far down, creating a siphon effect that prevents proper drainage.

### Drain Pump Malfunction

The drain pump pushes water out of the machine. If this pump fails, water stays inside. A pump can fail due to electrical issues or mechanical damage. You might hear a humming sound without water moving. This often indicates a faulty pump. Sometimes, objects get stuck in the impeller. This prevents the pump from spinning.

### Power or Electronic Glitches

Sometimes, the issue is not mechanical. A power surge or interruption can confuse the machine. The control board might stop sending signals to the drain pump. Resetting your LG washing machine can clear these minor glitches. Always check power connections first. Ensure the machine receives constant power.

## Essential Tools and Safety Precautions Before You Drain

Draining your LG washing machine involves water and electricity. Safety is very important. Always prepare your workspace before you begin. Gathering the right tools saves time and effort. It also helps prevent accidents.

### Tools You Will Need

You will need a few common household items to drain your LG washing machine. These tools make the job easier and cleaner.
*   **Buckets or Shallow Pans:** These catch the draining water. Have several on hand, as a full washer holds a lot of water.
*   **Towels or Old Rags:** Use these to absorb spills. Lay them down around your machine.
*   **Pliers or Adjustable Wrench:** You might need these to loosen stubborn clamps or connections.
*   **Screwdriver (Phillips and Flathead):** Some access panels or components might require a screwdriver.
*   **Gloves:** Protect your hands from dirty water or sharp edges.

4.  **Protect Your Floor:** Place plenty of towels and shallow pans. Water spills are common during draining. Water can damage flooring. Prepare for several gallons of water.

Taking these steps ensures a safer draining process. You will be ready to tackle the issue.

## Manual Draining Your LG Washing Machine: The Emergency Method

Sometimes, your LG washing machine has a lot of standing water. You need to remove it quickly. The manual draining method uses the drain pump filter access. This is the primary way to empty a washer that will not drain on its own. It is a messy job, but necessary. This method applies to most LG front-loading washing machines. For top-loaders, the process might differ. However, the general idea of accessing a drain point remains similar.

### Locating the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter is usually at the bottom front of your LG washing machine.
*   **Front-Loaders:** Look for a small access panel or a cover at the very bottom right or left corner. This panel often pops open or has a small latch.
*   **Top-Loaders:** Manual draining for top-loaders is less common through a filter. You might need to lower the drain hose. More on that later.

Once you find the cover, open it. You will see a large cap or a hose with a stopper. This is where you will drain the water.

### Preparing for Water Spill

A lot of water will come out. Be ready for it.
*   **Lay Down Towels:** Place thick towels directly under the access panel. Spread them wide.
*   **Position a Shallow Pan or Baking Tray:** A shallow pan fits under the small height of the opening. It will catch the initial rush of water. You will need to empty it multiple times.
*   **Have a Larger Bucket Ready:** Once the initial rush slows, you might be able to position a larger bucket. This makes emptying easier.

The water can be dirty. It may contain lint and debris. This link provides more details on how to drain the water: [How to Drain LG Washing Machine Water](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-drain-lg-washing-machine-water).

### Releasing the Drain Plug

Most LG models have a small, flexible hose with a stopper, or a large filter cap.
1.  **For Small Hose with Stopper:**
    *   Pull the small hose out from its clip.
    *   Point the hose towards your shallow pan.
    *   Carefully pull the stopper out. Water will flow out.
    *   Re-insert the stopper when the pan is full. Empty the pan. Repeat until no more water comes out.
2.  **For Large Filter Cap:**
    *   Slowly twist the large filter cap counter-clockwise.
    *   Water will start to trickle out. Have your pan ready.
    *   Continue unscrewing slowly. The water flow will increase.
    *   Twist it back to slow the flow or stop it to empty your pan.
    *   Do this carefully until all water has drained.

This process can take some time, especially if your washer was full. Be patient. Once all water is out, you can move on to cleaning the filter.

## Draining Through the Drain Hose: A Common Approach

Draining your LG washing machine through the drain hose is another effective method. This approach works well if the water level is not excessively high. It is also useful if you suspect a blockage within the hose itself. The drain hose is usually located at the back of your washing machine. It connects to a standpipe or a utility sink.

### Accessing the Drain Hose

First, you need to reach the drain hose.
*   **Pull the Machine Out:** Gently pull your LG washing machine away from the wall. You need enough space to work behind it.
*   **Locate the Hose:** The drain hose is a large, ribbed plastic hose. It usually comes out of the top or upper back of the machine. It often hooks into a standpipe or over the edge of a laundry sink.
*   **Prepare for Water:** Place a large bucket on the floor. This bucket must be lower than the bottom of your washing machine. This allows gravity to help drain the water.

### Lowering the Hose to Drain

Once you have access, you can start draining the water.
1.  **Remove the Hose from Standpipe/Sink:** Carefully unhook the drain hose from its current position. Water might begin to spill immediately, so have your bucket ready.
2.  **Lower the Hose End:** Point the open end of the drain hose into your large bucket. Make sure the hose end is lower than the water level inside the washing machine. Gravity will then pull the water out.
3.  **Secure the Hose:** The hose can move around. Hold it steady or secure it in the bucket. This prevents spills.
4.  **Monitor Water Flow:** Allow all the water to drain into the bucket. You might need to empty the bucket multiple times. Continue until no more water comes out of the hose.

This method works because it bypasses the pump. It relies solely on gravity.

### Clearing Hose Blockages

If water does not drain even after lowering the hose, the hose itself might be blocked.
*   **Disconnect Both Ends:** Disconnect the drain hose from both the washing machine and the standpipe/sink.
*   **Inspect the Hose:** Look inside the hose from both ends. You might see lint, socks, or other small items.
*   **Flush the Hose:** Take the hose outside or to a large sink. Run water through it from a garden hose or faucet. This helps clear internal blockages. If stubborn, use a long brush or a plumbing snake designed for small pipes.
*   **Check for Kinks:** Straighten the hose completely. Any kinks prevent water flow. Ensure the hose is not crimped when you push the machine back. This article provides steps on how to remove the drain hose: [How to Remove LG Washing Machine Drain Hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-remove-lg-washing-machine-drain-hose). Knowing how to install it can also be helpful for reassembly: [How to Install LG Washing Machine Drain Hose](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-install-lg-washing-machine-drain-hose).

After clearing any blockages, reattach the hose securely. Ensure it forms a proper siphon break if it drains into a standpipe. This prevents dirty water from flowing back into your washer.

## Clearing a Clogged Drain Pump Filter in Your LG Washer

A clogged drain pump filter is the most common reason for an LG washing machine not to drain. Cleaning it is a simple yet crucial maintenance task. This step should always follow manual draining. It ensures the problem is fully addressed.

### Removing and Cleaning the Filter

Once the water is mostly drained from the machine, you can remove the filter.
1.  **Locate the Filter:** The filter is behind the small access panel at the bottom front of your LG washer. If you have not fully drained the machine, do so now.
2.  **Unscrew the Filter Cap:** Twist the large filter cap counter-clockwise. It might be stiff. Once loose, pull it straight out.
3.  **Remove Debris:** The filter will likely have lint, hair, coins, or other small items. Pull these off the filter by hand.
4.  **Rinse the Filter:** Take the filter to a sink. Rinse it thoroughly under running water. Use an old toothbrush if needed to remove stubborn grime. Ensure all mesh holes are clear.
5.  **Inspect the Housing:** Look into the hole where the filter came from. Use your flashlight. Check for any large objects or blockages around the impeller blades. The impeller is the small fan-like part inside the pump. You can carefully remove any visible debris. Turn the impeller by hand to ensure it spins freely. Be cautious, as there might be sharp objects.

This simple cleaning step can fix most draining problems. It is a critical part of maintaining your LG washing machine.

### Inspecting the Pump Impeller

The impeller is part of the drain pump. It spins rapidly to push water out.
*   **Check for Obstructions:** Even after removing the filter, small objects can bypass it. They can get stuck directly in the impeller blades.
*   **Manual Turn:** Gently try to turn the impeller with your finger. It should spin freely. If it feels stiff or does not move, something is lodged there.
*   **Remove Blockages:** Use pliers or tweezers to carefully remove any foreign objects. These might include coins, paper clips, or even pet hair clumps. Make sure nothing restricts the impeller's movement.

Cleaning the pump filter and inspecting the impeller is vital. It restores your machine's draining function. Regular cleaning prevents future clogs.

### Reassembling the Filter and Cover

Once everything is clean and clear:
1.  **Insert Filter:** Push the cleaned filter back into its housing.
2.  **Screw On Cap:** Twist the filter cap clockwise until it is snug. Do not overtighten it.
3.  **Close Access Panel:** Snap or close the access panel cover.

After reassembly, you can plug in the machine and turn the water supply back on. Test a drain cycle.

## Troubleshooting Persistent LG Washing Machine Drain Issues

You have drained the water and cleaned the filter. But your LG washing machine still won't drain properly. This means the problem is deeper. Several other components can cause drainage issues. These steps require a bit more investigation. You might need to consider professional help if these steps do not solve the problem.

### Checking the Drain Pump

The drain pump is crucial for expelling water. If it is faulty, water will stay.
*   **Listen for Sounds:** Start a drain/spin cycle. Listen closely to the machine. Do you hear a humming sound from the pump area but no water movement? This suggests the pump motor is trying to work but cannot push water. It might be faulty or severely clogged beyond the filter.
*   **Test Pump Functionality:** This often requires a multimeter and knowledge of electrical testing. If you are not comfortable, skip this step. A technician can test the pump's electrical continuity and resistance.
*   **Inspect for Physical Damage:** Once the pump is accessible (often involves removing panels), look for cracks, leaks, or loose connections. Sometimes, a foreign object can damage the impeller directly, even after clearing the filter.

Replacing a faulty drain pump is possible for a DIYer. However, it requires some mechanical skills. Ensure you get the correct replacement part for your specific LG model.

### Inspecting the Pressure Sensor

The pressure sensor tells the washing machine how much water is inside. It signals the control board when the water level is low enough for draining to start.
*   **Faulty Reading:** If the pressure sensor is faulty, it might incorrectly tell the machine that water is still present. This prevents the drain cycle from completing.
*   **Check the Air Trap Hose:** A small hose connects the pressure sensor to the tub's air trap. This hose can get clogged with detergent residue or lint. Disconnect and clean this hose. Blow air through it to ensure it is clear.
*   **Sensor Malfunction:** A faulty sensor itself might need replacement. Testing a pressure sensor usually requires specialized tools and expertise.

### Resetting Your LG Washing Machine

Sometimes, a simple reset can clear electronic glitches. This can resolve drainage problems not caused by physical clogs.
*   **Power Cycle Reset:**
    1.  Unplug the washing machine from the power outlet.
    2.  Wait for at least 5 minutes. This allows the control board to fully discharge.
    3.  Plug the washing machine back in.
    4.  Turn on the machine and try a spin or drain cycle.
*   **Hard Reset (if available):** Some LG models have a specific reset procedure. Check your owner's manual for model-specific instructions. Often, it involves holding down a combination of buttons for several seconds. For general instructions on resetting your LG washing machine, see: [How to Reset Your LG Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-your-lg-washing-machine).

If none of these steps fix the issue, the problem might be with the main control board. This is a complex repair. It is best left to a certified appliance technician. They have the diagnostic tools and experience to properly identify and fix control board issues.

## Preventive Maintenance for Optimal LG Washer Drainage

Preventing drainage problems is always better than fixing them. Regular maintenance keeps your LG washing machine running smoothly. It extends its lifespan. Follow these simple tips to avoid future water issues. You will save time and avoid frustration.

### Regular Drain Pump Filter Cleaning

This is the most important step for preventing clogs.
*   **Frequency:** Clean your LG washing machine's drain pump filter every 1-3 months. If you have pets or do many heavy-duty washes, clean it more often.
*   **Routine:** Make it a part of your regular appliance maintenance schedule. This ensures you do not forget it.
*   **Why It Helps:** A clean filter prevents lint, debris, and small items from reaching and damaging the drain pump. It ensures unobstructed water flow.

### Proper Loading Practices

How you load your washing machine affects its performance, including drainage.
*   **Avoid Overloading:** Do not stuff too many clothes into the washer. Overloading can push small items into the drain system. It can also prevent clothes from tumbling correctly. This leaves excess water in fabrics.
*   **Balance the Load:** Distribute clothes evenly in the drum. An unbalanced load can cause excessive vibrations. This might dislodge the drain hose. It can also trigger error codes that stop the cycle.
*   **Check Pockets:** Always check pockets before washing. Coins, keys, tissues, and small toys are common culprits. They often end up in the drain pump filter or block the drain hose.

### Correct Detergent and Additive Use

Using the right amount and type of detergent is key for drainage.
*   **Use HE Detergent:** Always use High-Efficiency (HE) detergent for HE washers. HE detergents produce less suds. Too many suds can create a thick residue. This residue can clog hoses and sensors over time.
*   **Measure Correctly:** Follow detergent instructions for the correct amount. More detergent does not mean cleaner clothes. It means more suds and residue.
*   **Avoid Excess Fabric Softener:** Fabric softener can leave a gummy residue. This residue builds up in hoses and drain components. Use it sparingly. Dilute it if recommended.

### Inspecting the Drain Hose Regularly

The drain hose is an overlooked component.
*   **Check for Kinks:** Periodically pull your washing machine out. Inspect the drain hose for any kinks or bends. Straighten them if found.
*   **Proper Installation:** Ensure the drain hose is installed correctly. It should have an air gap or be properly hooked into a standpipe. This prevents siphon issues or dirty water backflow.
*   **Secure Connections:** Check that all hose connections are tight. Loose connections can lead to leaks.

By following these preventive maintenance tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of your LG washing machine having drainage problems. A little effort now saves you a lot of hassle later.
