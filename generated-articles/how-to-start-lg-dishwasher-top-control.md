This article shows you exactly how to start LG dishwasher top control models. We cover everything from loading dishes to selecting the right cycle. You will learn about basic controls and advanced features. We also provide simple troubleshooting tips if your dishwasher does not start. My goal is to help you confidently run your LG dishwasher every time.

### Takeaway:

*   Load dishes properly and add detergent.
*   Select the desired wash cycle.
*   Close the door firmly.
*   Press the Start button within 3 seconds of closing the door.
*   Troubleshoot issues like door latch or power problems if it does not start.

To start your LG dishwasher with top controls, load the dishes and add detergent. Select your preferred wash cycle. Firmly close the dishwasher door. Then, press the "Start" button located on the top control panel. This action must happen within a few seconds of closing the door for the cycle to begin.

## Understanding Your LG Dishwasher's Top Controls

LG dishwashers with top controls offer a sleek, modern look. The control panel sits on the top edge of the door. This design hides buttons when the door is closed. This gives your kitchen a clean, seamless appearance.

Knowing where each button is helps you use your dishwasher effectively. You will find controls for power, cycle selection, and start. There are often options for extra features too. Familiarizing yourself with these helps you operate the appliance with ease.

### Locating the Control Panel

When you open your LG dishwasher door, look along the top edge. You will see a row of buttons and a display screen. This is your top control panel. It becomes visible only when the door is open.

This placement prevents accidental button presses. It also protects the panel from spills. Understanding its location is the first step to starting your dishwasher. Always ensure the panel is dry and clean before use.

### Common Control Panel Buttons

LG top control dishwashers share many common buttons. Knowing their purpose is important for proper operation. Each button has a specific function for your wash cycle.

*   **Power On/Off:** This button turns the dishwasher on or off. You must turn it on before selecting a cycle. Always power it off when not in use.
*   **Cycle Selection:** These buttons let you choose the wash program. Examples include "Auto," "Normal," "Heavy," or "Delicate." Select the cycle that best suits your dish load.
*   **Start/Resume:** This button begins the wash cycle. You press it after selecting a cycle and closing the door. This button often resumes a cycle if you pause it.
*   **Delay Start:** This option lets you set a time for the wash cycle to begin later. It is useful for running the dishwasher during off-peak energy hours. You can choose a delay of 2, 4, or more hours.
*   **Child Lock:** This feature locks the control panel. It stops children from accidentally changing settings or starting the dishwasher. Activating it typically involves holding down a combination of buttons.
*   **Options/Extra Features:** These buttons provide additional wash enhancements. Examples include "High Temp," "Sanitize," "Extra Dry," or "Half Load." Use these for specific cleaning needs.

Each button plays a key role in customizing your wash experience. Refer to your specific LG model's user manual for precise details. This helps you get the most out of your LG dishwasher.

## Step-by-Step: Starting Your LG Top Control Dishwasher

Starting your LG dishwasher with top controls is a straightforward process. Following these steps ensures a smooth start every time. I always make sure these basics are covered before anything else. This routine helps prevent common errors.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Dishes and Dishwasher

Before you press any buttons, prepare the machine. Load dishes properly to ensure good cleaning. Make sure the spray arms can spin freely without hitting anything. Scrape off large food particles from plates. This prevents clogging the filter.

Next, add detergent to the dispenser. Use only dishwasher detergent, not regular dish soap. Add rinse aid if your model uses it. Close the detergent dispenser door securely. Proper preparation helps your dishwasher clean effectively.

### Step 2: Power On Your Dishwasher

Open the dishwasher door to access the top control panel. Locate the "Power" button. Press this button to turn on the dishwasher. You will see the display light up. This shows the dishwasher is ready for your input.

The display might show the last used cycle or a default setting. Powering it on is your first interaction with the machine. It signals that you are ready to start a wash cycle.

### Step 3: Select Your Desired Wash Cycle

Now, choose the wash cycle that fits your load. Look at the available cycle buttons on the top panel. Options typically include "Auto," "Normal," "Heavy," or "Delicate." Consider how dirty your dishes are. Choose a cycle that provides the best cleaning for them.

If your dishes are lightly soiled, a shorter cycle like "Express" might be enough. For heavily soiled pots and pans, "Heavy" cycle works best. Selecting the correct cycle saves energy and water. It also protects your dishes.

### Step 4: Add Any Desired Options

Your LG dishwasher might have extra features. These can improve cleaning or drying. Look for buttons like "High Temp," "Sanitize," or "Extra Dry." Press these options if you want to use them. For example, choose "Sanitize" for baby bottles.

Using "Extra Dry" helps prevent water spots on plastic items. Not every wash needs these options. They are there for specific needs. Choose them after selecting your main wash cycle.

### Step 5: Close the Dishwasher Door Firmly

This is a critical step for LG top control dishwashers. After selecting your cycle and options, close the dishwasher door. You must close it completely. The door needs to latch securely for the cycle to begin.

Listen for a click sound when you push the door shut. If the door is not fully closed, the dishwasher will not start. The control panel may display an error or simply not respond. Ensure the door is tightly shut before moving to the next step.

### Step 6: Press the Start Button Within Seconds

With the door firmly closed, press the "Start" button. This button is on the top control panel. It is often labeled "Start" or "Start/Resume." You need to press this button quickly after closing the door. LG dishwashers usually require you to press "Start" within 3 to 4 seconds of closing the door.

This quick action tells the dishwasher you are ready to begin the cycle. If you wait too long, the dishwasher might reset or not respond. Pressing "Start" lights up the button, and you may hear a hum as the cycle begins. If your LG dishwasher still won't start, consider checking our guide on [how to start an LG dishwasher without a start button](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-start-lg-dishwasher-without-start-button) for alternative methods or troubleshooting.

## Choosing the Right Wash Cycle for LG Top Control Models

Selecting the correct wash cycle is important for good cleaning results. It also helps save water and energy. LG dishwashers offer various cycles designed for different dish types and soil levels. Understanding each option helps you make the best choice.

### Understanding Cycle Types

LG dishwashers come with several built-in wash cycles. Each one has a specific purpose. Knowing these cycles helps you get the best performance from your appliance. I always consider the type of mess and the dish material.

*   **Auto:** This cycle uses sensors to detect how dirty your dishes are. It automatically adjusts water temperature, wash time, and intensity. It is a good option for mixed loads with varying soil levels. This cycle saves energy by only using what is needed.
*   **Normal:** The normal cycle is for everyday dishes with light to medium soil. It is the most commonly used cycle. It balances cleaning power with water and energy efficiency. Most loads fit well into this setting.
*   **Heavy:** This cycle is for heavily soiled dishes, pots, and pans. It uses higher temperatures and longer wash times. This setting helps remove baked-on food and grease. Use this for your toughest cleaning jobs.
*   **Delicate/Gentle:** This cycle provides a gentle wash for delicate items. It is suitable for fine china, crystal, or fragile glassware. It uses lower temperatures and less aggressive spray pressure. This helps protect delicate items from damage.
*   **Express/Quick:** This cycle offers a fast wash for lightly soiled dishes. It is ideal when you need dishes quickly. This cycle uses less water and energy but may not dry dishes completely. Do not use it for very dirty items.
*   **Rinse Only:** This cycle is useful for rinsing dishes that will not be washed immediately. It helps prevent food from drying onto plates. It uses only water and no detergent. This cycle is not for cleaning, only for pre-rinsing.

Choosing the right cycle extends the life of your dishes. It also ensures efficient operation of your LG top control dishwasher.

## Using LG Dishwasher Advanced Features: Delay & Lock

Beyond basic washing, LG dishwashers offer advanced features. These features provide flexibility and safety. Using "Delay Start" lets you control when your wash begins. "Child Lock" prevents unintended use. I find these features very helpful for my daily routine.

### Activating Delay Start

The Delay Start feature allows you to postpone the start of a wash cycle. This is perfect for running your dishwasher during off-peak electricity hours. It saves money on your utility bills. You can set the delay for several hours, depending on your model.

To use Delay Start:

1.  **Load dishes and add detergent.** Complete your dish preparation as usual.
2.  **Turn on the dishwasher.** Press the "Power" button.
3.  **Select your wash cycle and options.** Choose the main cycle like "Normal" or "Auto."
4.  **Press the "Delay Start" button.** Each press typically adds a few hours to the delay. Keep pressing until you reach your desired delay time. The display will show the delayed hours.
5.  **Close the dishwasher door.** Make sure it latches shut.
6.  **Press the "Start" button.** Do this within a few seconds of closing the door. The dishwasher will begin its countdown. It will start the cycle once the delay time ends.

The Delay Start feature gives you great control over your energy use. It fits washing into your schedule, not the other way around.

### Engaging Child Lock

Child Lock is a safety feature designed to prevent children from operating the dishwasher. It locks the control panel. This stops little hands from pressing buttons or opening the door during a cycle. It provides peace of mind for parents.

To activate Child Lock:

1.  **Start your desired wash cycle.** The dishwasher needs to be running or about to start.
2.  **Locate the Child Lock button or combination.** It might be a dedicated button. Often, you hold down two buttons at the same time, such as "Half Load" and "Sanitize." Look for a small lock icon next to the buttons on the panel.
3.  **Press and hold the required buttons for 3-5 seconds.** You will usually hear a beep. A lock icon will appear on the display. This confirms that the control panel is locked.

To deactivate Child Lock, repeat the same process. Hold the same buttons for 3-5 seconds until the lock icon disappears. This returns control of the panel. This feature keeps your home safer and prevents cycle interruptions.

## Troubleshooting When Your LG Dishwasher Won't Start

Sometimes, your LG dishwasher with top controls might not start. This can be frustrating. Many common issues have simple fixes. I always check these basic things first before assuming a major problem. Understanding these issues helps you get your appliance running again quickly. If you have power but it won't start, similar issues may occur with other brands, like when a [GE dishwasher has power but will not start](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-ge-dishwasher-have-power-but-will-not-start).

### Door Latch Issues

The most common reason an LG dishwasher does not start is an open door. The door must latch completely for safety reasons. If the latch is not fully engaged, the dishwasher will not begin its cycle. Check for anything blocking the door from closing properly.

Make sure no dishes or racks are sticking out. Push the door firmly until you hear a clear click. Some models have a sensor that detects the door closure. If this sensor is faulty, the dishwasher will not start even if the door seems closed. Check the latch mechanism for visible damage.

### Power Supply Problems

A dishwasher needs power to run. Check if the dishwasher is plugged in correctly. Ensure the power cord is secure in the outlet. If the outlet is connected to a switch, make sure the switch is on. Sometimes, a dedicated appliance switch is located under the sink.

Also, check your home's circuit breaker box. A tripped breaker will cut power to the dishwasher. Reset the breaker by flipping it off, then on again. If the breaker trips again quickly, it indicates a larger electrical issue. Do not force it.

### Control Panel Locked or Glitched

If your LG dishwasher's control panel is unresponsive, it might be locked. The child lock feature can prevent any button presses. Refer to the previous section on how to deactivate the child lock. Hold the specific combination of buttons until the lock icon disappears.

Sometimes, the control panel might glitch. This happens due to power surges or other electrical interruptions. A simple reset can often fix this. To reset, turn off the power to the dishwasher at the circuit breaker for about 5 minutes. Then, turn it back on. This can clear minor electronic errors. If issues persist, you may need to [reset the LG dishwasher control panel](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-reset-lg-dishwasher-control-panel).

### Error Codes on Display

LG dishwashers often display error codes when there is a problem. These codes appear on the digital display. Each code points to a specific issue. Refer to your LG dishwasher owner's manual for a list of error codes.

Common codes include "LE" for motor error or "OE" for drainage error. Knowing the code helps you diagnose the problem faster. Some errors, like "FE" (water supply), might prevent the dishwasher from starting. Addressing the specific error code is key to resolving the starting issue.

### Water Supply Issues

A dishwasher needs water to operate. If there is no water supply, the dishwasher will not start its cycle. Check if the water supply valve to the dishwasher is fully open. This valve is usually located under the sink. Turn it counter-clockwise to open it.

Also, check your home's main water supply. Ensure it is on and functioning correctly. A kinked water inlet hose can also restrict water flow. Straighten any bends in the hose behind the dishwasher. Lack of water will prevent the wash cycle from beginning.

### Dispenser Issues

Sometimes, the dispenser for detergent or rinse aid can cause problems. If the dispenser is clogged or faulty, it might signal an error. This can prevent the cycle from starting. Make sure the dispenser is clean and free of residue. Open and close it a few times to ensure it moves freely.

Also, confirm you are using the correct type of detergent. Using too much or the wrong kind can create excessive suds. This can trigger sensors and stop the dishwasher. Ensure the dispenser door latches properly after adding detergent.

### Drain Issues

While less common for preventing a start, a clogged drain can impact operations. If the dishwasher senses an issue with draining previous water, it might not start a new cycle. Check the drain filter inside the dishwasher. Remove any food debris or blockages. Ensure the air gap (if installed) is not clogged. Some models might require the drain hose to be properly installed to prevent airlocks. Addressing drainage ensures smooth operation. If your dishwasher starts but then stops, like a [Frigidaire dishwasher starting and then stopping](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-frigidaire-dishwasher-start-and-then-stop), a drain issue might be the cause.

## Maintaining Your LG Dishwasher for Consistent Starts

Proper maintenance helps your LG dishwasher perform reliably. Regular care can prevent many common starting issues. I found that a little effort now saves a lot of hassle later. These simple steps ensure your appliance runs smoothly for years.

### Clean the Dishwasher Filter

Your LG dishwasher has a filter system that traps food particles. If this filter gets clogged, it can affect water circulation. This can lead to poor cleaning and even prevent the dishwasher from starting. I clean my filter regularly, usually once a month.

To clean the filter:

1.  **Locate the filter.** It is usually at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.
2.  **Remove the filter.** Twist and lift it out. Some models have multiple parts.
3.  **Rinse under running water.** Use a brush to remove stubborn food debris.
4.  **Reinstall the filter.** Make sure it clicks back into place securely.

A clean filter ensures proper drainage and water flow. This helps the wash cycle begin without issues.

### Inspect Spray Arms

The spray arms distribute water during the wash cycle. If their holes are clogged, water spray is reduced. This impacts cleaning performance. It can also cause the dishwasher to struggle or not start properly. Check the spray arms regularly.

Spin them by hand to ensure they rotate freely. Look for clogged holes. Use a small wire or toothpick to clear any blockages. Ensure the spray arms are securely attached and not cracked. Proper water distribution is essential for a successful wash.

### Use Proper Detergent and Rinse Aid

Using the correct type and amount of detergent is important. Only use automatic dishwasher detergent. Do not use hand dish soap. Too much soap creates excessive suds. This can lead to overflows or sensor errors. These errors might prevent the dishwasher from starting.

Rinse aid helps with drying and prevents water spots. Ensure the rinse aid dispenser is filled. Using good quality products supports efficient operation. It also prevents residue buildup that can affect performance.

### Run a Cleaning Cycle

Even if your dishwasher looks clean, hidden buildup can occur. Hard water deposits, grease, and food residue can accumulate inside. Running a specialized dishwasher cleaning cycle helps. I do this every few months.

Use a dishwasher cleaner or a cup of white vinegar. Place it in an empty dishwasher. Run a heavy or sanitize cycle. This helps remove mineral buildup and odors. A clean interior ensures all components work correctly for a smooth start.

### Check for Door Seal Integrity

The door gasket or seal prevents water leaks. Over time, these seals can become worn or damaged. A faulty seal might prevent the door from latching properly. If the door does not latch, the dishwasher will not start.

Inspect the door seal for cracks, tears, or residue buildup. Clean the seal regularly with a damp cloth. If the seal is damaged, it may need replacement. A good seal is crucial for secure door closure and proper operation.

## When to Seek Professional Help for LG Dishwasher Issues

Most LG dishwasher starting problems have simple solutions. However, some issues require a professional. Knowing when to call an expert saves you time and prevents further damage. I recommend professional help when the problem is beyond basic troubleshooting.

### Persistent Error Codes

If your LG dishwasher displays a continuous error code, it points to a specific issue. While your manual explains the code, fixing it might be complex. For example, "LE" for motor error or "tE" for temperature sensor error often mean a component has failed. These parts typically require specialized tools or knowledge to replace.

If you have tried resetting the dishwasher and the code persists, contact an LG service technician. They can accurately diagnose the problem. They also have access to genuine replacement parts. Do not attempt complex repairs without proper training.

### Electrical Problems

Any issues involving the dishwasher's electrical system need professional attention. If the circuit breaker trips repeatedly, or you notice burning smells, stop using the dishwasher. This indicates a serious electrical fault. Such problems can be dangerous.

A qualified electrician or appliance technician can safely inspect wiring. They can diagnose issues with the control board or heating element. Never attempt to work on electrical components if you are not qualified. This ensures your safety and prevents further damage to the appliance.

### Water Leaks

If you see water leaking from your LG dishwasher, turn it off immediately. Locate the water supply valve and turn it off. Leaks can cause significant damage to your floors and cabinets. They can also create electrical hazards.

Common causes of leaks include faulty seals, hoses, or pumps. A technician can find the source of the leak. They can replace worn-out components. Ignoring leaks can lead to costly water damage and mold growth.

### Unusual Noises or Smells

Strange noises like grinding or banging during operation are warning signs. These often point to mechanical problems with the pump or motor. Unusual smells, especially burning odors, are also serious. They can indicate an electrical short or overheating.

Stop the dishwasher and unplug it. These symptoms suggest internal component failure. A professional can identify the failing part. They can replace it safely before it causes more extensive damage.

### Dishwasher Not Draining

If your dishwasher consistently does not drain water, it needs attention. While a clogged filter is a simple fix, a deeper blockage might exist. Issues with the drain pump or drain hose installation can prevent proper drainage.

A technician can inspect the entire drain system. They can clear stubborn clogs in the hose or air gap. They can also replace a faulty drain pump. Proper drainage is vital for sanitary washing and preventing standing water in the tub.

Remember, attempting complex repairs yourself can void your warranty. It can also cause more harm to the appliance. For safety and peace of mind, contact an authorized LG service center. They have the expertise to fix your LG top control dishwasher.
