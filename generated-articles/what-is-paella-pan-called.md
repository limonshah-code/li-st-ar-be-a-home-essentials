This article explores the authentic name for a paella pan. We will look at its design, the materials used, and why its shape matters. You will also learn how to choose the right size and care for your paellera. By the end, you will understand everything about this special pan.

### Takeaway

*   The traditional paella pan is called a "paellera."
*   Its design ensures even cooking and promotes the coveted *socarrat*.
*   Choosing the right size and material improves your paella.
*   Proper care extends the life of your paellera.

The specific cooking vessel for making paella is known as a **paellera**. This term comes directly from the Valencian word for the pan itself. It is a wide, shallow, round pan with two handles, designed to cook paella evenly over an open flame or stovetop.

## The Official Name: What Is Paella Pan Called?

The official name for a paella pan is **paellera**. This word originates from the Valencian dialect, which is spoken in the region where paella first appeared. It is simple to remember once you know it. The term refers specifically to the pan, not the dish itself.

Many people mistakenly call it a "paella pan" or "paella dish." While these descriptions are common, the correct and traditional name is paellera. Using the proper name connects you more deeply to the history and culture of authentic paella cooking. It also shows a respect for tradition. This unique pan has a specific design that works best for paella.

Understanding the name helps you identify the right tool. When you shop for paella cookware, you should look for a "paellera." This ensures you buy the correct type of pan for making authentic Spanish paella. The paellera is more than just a pan; it is a key part of the paella experience.

## Characteristics of a Traditional Paellera Pan

A traditional paellera pan has distinct features. These features are essential for cooking paella correctly. First, it is always wide and shallow. This design allows the rice to spread out in a single, thin layer. This maximizes the surface area for evaporation.

Second, a paellera has sloped sides. These sides are not too deep. They help the rice cook evenly and allow the liquid to evaporate at a consistent rate. This prevents the top layers of rice from becoming mushy. This shallow depth is critical for achieving the perfect texture.

Third, every paellera has two handles on opposite sides. These handles make the pan easy to lift and carry, even when it is full. They are usually made of the same material as the pan or have heat-resistant coatings. The handles are sturdy and robust. They can support the weight of a full paella.

Lastly, the bottom of a paellera is typically flat or slightly concave. This flat base ensures even heat distribution across the entire cooking surface. This uniform heat is vital for developing the desired *socarrat*. This golden-brown crust forms at the bottom of the paella. These characteristics make the paellera unique.

## Materials That Make a Great Paella Pan

Paella pans come in several materials. Each material offers different cooking properties and care requirements. The choice of material affects the pan's performance. It also influences how you maintain it.

### Polished Carbon Steel Paelleras

Polished carbon steel is the most traditional material for a paellera. Many paella chefs prefer it. This material heats quickly and evenly. It also develops a natural non-stick patina over time with proper seasoning. This patina enhances the flavor of the paella. Carbon steel pans are very durable. However, they require careful maintenance to prevent rust. You must season them before use and dry them thoroughly after washing. If you want to learn how to prepare this pan for cooking, consider checking out our guide on [how to season paella pan carbon steel](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-season-paella-pan-carbon-steel).

### Enamel Paelleras

Enamel-coated steel paelleras are another popular option. They have a dark, speckled enamel finish. This coating makes them easier to clean than polished carbon steel. Enamel pans do not require seasoning and resist rust. They are a good choice for beginners. The enamel surface provides a naturally non-stick property. However, the enamel can chip if dropped or scraped. Handle them with care.

### Stainless Steel Paelleras

Stainless steel paelleras are highly durable and easy to maintain. They do not rust and do not require seasoning. Stainless steel pans are often heavier than carbon steel versions. This material distributes heat well. It is also suitable for gas, electric, and even induction cooktops. Stainless steel is a versatile choice for everyday use. These pans are a modern alternative to traditional materials.

### Non-Stick Paelleras

Some paella pans feature a non-stick coating. These pans are very convenient for cleaning. They prevent rice from sticking to the bottom. Non-stick paelleras are ideal for those who prefer easy cleanup. However, they may not produce the same *socarrat* as traditional pans. The non-stick surface can also degrade over time. Use silicone or wooden utensils to protect the coating.

Each material choice influences your cooking experience. Consider your cooking habits and desired outcome.

## Choosing the Right Size Paella Pan

Selecting the correct size paella pan is crucial for making good paella. The pan's diameter depends on the number of servings you want to make. Paella is designed to cook in a thin layer. This ensures even cooking and promotes the development of the *socarrat*. A pan that is too small for the amount of rice will result in a thick, uneven layer. This prevents proper evaporation and cooking.

Paella pans are measured by their diameter in centimeters. Here is a general guide to help you choose:

*   **26-30 cm (10-12 inches):** Ideal for 2-4 servings. This size is perfect for small families or couples. It fits well on most home stovetops.
*   **34-40 cm (13-16 inches):** Suitable for 4-6 servings. This is a common size for family meals. It may require a larger burner or outdoor cooking setup.
*   **46-55 cm (18-22 inches):** Perfect for 8-12 servings. This size is great for parties or gatherings. You will likely need an outdoor paella burner for this pan.
*   **60 cm (24 inches) and larger:** Designed for very large groups, 15+ servings. These are typically used for catering or large events. They require specialized large burners.

Always consider the number of people you plan to serve regularly. It is better to have a slightly larger pan than a pan too small. A larger pan allows the rice to spread out properly. This is key to achieving authentic paella. Our guide on [how to choose paella pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-choose-paella-pan) offers more details on size and type selection.

## Why the Paella Pan's Design Matters for Authentic Paella

The unique design of the paellera is not accidental. It is engineered to achieve specific cooking results essential for authentic paella. Every feature, from its wide diameter to its shallow depth, plays a vital role. This design ensures that the paella cooks evenly and develops the desired textures.

First, the wide, flat bottom provides maximum surface area. This allows the rice to cook in a thin layer, usually no more than half an inch thick. A thin layer promotes even cooking of each rice grain. It also allows the liquid to evaporate efficiently. This controlled evaporation is essential for developing the rice's texture.

Second, the shallow depth prevents the paella from stewing. If the pan were too deep, the rice would steam rather than gently simmer and toast. Steamed rice would be mushy and lack the distinct texture of true paella. The shallow design also encourages rapid evaporation of the cooking liquid. This process concentrates flavors and helps the rice absorb the broth perfectly.

Third, the design is crucial for forming the *socarrat*. This is the crispy, caramelized crust of rice that forms at the bottom of the pan. The wide, flat base ensures consistent contact with the heat source. This allows the bottom layer of rice to toast and brown without burning. Many paella enthusiasts consider the *socarrat* the best part of the dish. Without the proper paellera design, achieving this crust is very difficult. The handles also allow for easy rotation and movement, which helps create an even *socarrat*. This pan is purpose-built for paella.

## Caring for Your Paella Pan

Proper care extends the life of your paella pan. The specific care steps depend on the pan's material. Most paelleras, especially carbon steel ones, require special attention. Neglecting care can lead to rust or sticky surfaces.

For **carbon steel paelleras**, seasoning is the first step. You must season it before first use to create a protective, non-stick layer. After each use, wash the pan by hand with warm water and a soft sponge. Avoid harsh detergents or steel wool. They can strip the seasoning. After washing, dry the pan immediately and thoroughly. Apply a thin layer of cooking oil to the entire pan, especially the cooking surface, before storing it. This oil layer prevents rust. If rust appears, you can remove it. Our guide on [how to get rust off paella pan](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-get-rust-off-paella-pan) offers detailed instructions.

**Enamel paelleras** are easier to care for. They do not require seasoning. Wash them with warm soapy water and a soft sponge. Rinse and dry them completely. Avoid abrasive cleaners or metal utensils, as they can chip the enamel. Enamel pans are more resistant to rust, but proper drying is still important.

**Stainless steel paelleras** are the most low-maintenance. They are dishwasher safe, but handwashing is often recommended to preserve their shine. Use warm soapy water and a sponge. They do not rust and do not require seasoning. For tough stains, you can use a stainless steel cleaner.

**Non-stick paelleras** should be washed by hand. Use a soft sponge and mild soap. Avoid metal utensils to prevent scratching the coating. Dry them thoroughly. While easier to clean, their non-stick coating can wear down over time.

Always store your paella pan in a dry place. Proper storage prevents damage and keeps the pan ready for your next paella.

Socarrat is the delicious, caramelized crust of rice that forms at the bottom of a paella pan. It is a highly sought-after element in authentic paella. The wide, shallow design of the paellera helps create this crispy layer by allowing the bottom rice to toast without burning. It adds a unique texture and flavor.

### Do paella pans work on induction cooktops?
