## How to Test Your LG Refrigerator Start Relay: A Comprehensive Guide

A refrigerator is a crucial appliance in any home. It keeps your food fresh and drinks cold. When your LG refrigerator stops cooling, it can create a big problem. Often, the culprit is a small but mighty component: the start relay. I know how frustrating it feels when your fridge acts up. You might hear strange clicking sounds, or the compressor simply won't kick on. This guide will help you understand the LG refrigerator start relay, identify its symptoms, and show you exactly how to test it. We will cover the necessary tools, safety precautions, and clear, step-by-step instructions. You will learn to diagnose the problem and potentially fix it yourself, saving time and money.

### Takeaway

*   **Symptoms:** Listen for clicking, humming, or a completely silent compressor.
*   **Safety First:** Always unplug your LG refrigerator before starting any work.
*   **Tools:** A multimeter is essential for accurate testing.
*   **Visual Check:** Look for burnt spots or listen for rattling sounds inside the relay.
*   **Multimeter Test:** Measure continuity and resistance across the relay's terminals.
*   **Interpretation:** Compare your readings to a working relay's specifications to determine functionality.

To test an LG refrigerator start relay, first unplug the refrigerator. Locate the relay on the side of the compressor. Remove the relay and visually inspect it for damage. Shake the relay to check for rattling. Use a multimeter to test for continuity and proper resistance across the relay's terminals. This determines if the relay is electrically sound.

### Understanding the LG Refrigerator Start Relay's Role

The start relay acts as a tiny but mighty switch for your LG refrigerator's compressor. Think of it as a gatekeeper. Its main job is to provide a quick surge of power to the compressor's start winding. This surge gives the compressor the initial push it needs to begin its cooling cycle. Once the compressor begins running, the relay disengages the start winding, allowing the compressor to operate efficiently on its run winding.

#### What is the Start Relay?

The start relay is a small electrical component. It usually attaches directly to the side of the compressor. LG refrigerators use different types of relays, but their core function remains the same. The relay ensures the compressor starts smoothly and safely.

#### Why is it Important?

Without a functioning start relay, your compressor cannot begin its cooling process. The compressor is the heart of your refrigerator. It circulates refrigerant, which absorbs heat from inside the fridge. If the compressor does not start, your LG refrigerator will not cool. This can lead to spoiled food and wasted money.

#### How it Works with the Compressor

When your thermostat calls for cooling, power flows to the compressor. The start relay receives this power. It briefly connects power to the compressor's start winding. This temporary power boost helps the motor overcome initial inertia. Once the motor gains speed, the relay disconnects the start winding, and the compressor continues running using only its run winding. This process protects the motor from overheating. It also makes sure your LG refrigerator runs efficiently.

### Common Symptoms of a Faulty LG Refrigerator Start Relay

Identifying symptoms is the first step in troubleshooting any appliance issue. If your LG refrigerator is showing signs of trouble, the start relay is a common suspect. I have seen many cases where a simple relay issue causes significant concern. Understanding these signs can save you from unnecessary repairs.

#### Clicking or Humming Noises

One of the most common indicators is a rapid clicking sound coming from the back of the refrigerator. You might hear this click every few minutes. This sound often means the relay is trying to start the compressor but fails. The relay might be engaging and disengaging quickly. This happens because it cannot establish a stable connection for the compressor to run.

Sometimes, you might hear a low humming sound, followed by a click, and then silence. This indicates the compressor attempts to start but cannot. The humming is the compressor motor trying to engage. The click is the relay or overload protector shutting it down. This happens to prevent damage to the motor.

#### Refrigerator Not Cooling or Not Cooling Enough

The most obvious symptom of a faulty relay is a refrigerator that does not cool. Your food will spoil quickly. You might notice the freezer section also warming up. The internal temperature will rise, indicating a lack of refrigerant circulation. If the compressor does not run, no cooling takes place. This makes the start relay a prime suspect.

Sometimes, the refrigerator cools intermittently. It might work for a while, then stop. This suggests the relay is failing sporadically. It tries to work, but its performance is unreliable. This can be frustrating because you might think the problem resolved itself. However, the issue will likely return.

#### Compressor Issues

A faulty relay directly impacts the compressor's operation. You might find the compressor is warm to the touch but not running. This warmth comes from the failed attempts to start. The relay's job is to protect the compressor. If the relay is faulty, it can prevent the compressor from ever turning on. This is a critical issue because the compressor must run for the refrigerator to function.

In some severe cases, a consistently failing relay can stress the compressor. This might lead to compressor failure over time. Therefore, fixing a faulty start relay early is important. It helps prevent more expensive repairs down the line.

### Essential Tools and Safety Precautions Before Testing

Before you begin any work on your LG refrigerator, gather the right tools. More importantly, prioritize your safety. Working with electrical appliances carries risks. I always make sure I have everything ready and understand the safety steps. This helps prevent accidents and ensures a smooth repair process.

#### Necessary Tools for Testing

You will need a few basic tools to test your LG refrigerator start relay. These tools are common in most DIY toolkits. A [multimeter](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-lg-refrigerator-main-control-board) is the most critical item. It measures electrical properties like resistance and continuity.

*   **Multimeter:** This is non-negotiable for accurate testing. Ensure it has settings for Ohms (Î©) to measure resistance and continuity.
*   **Screwdrivers:** You will likely need both Philips head and flathead screwdrivers. These help remove access panels.
*   **Nut Drivers or Socket Set:** Some LG refrigerator models use nuts to secure components. A small set might be useful.
*   **Pliers:** Pliers can help disconnect stubborn wires or clips.
*   **Work Gloves:** Protect your hands from sharp edges or grime.
*   **Flashlight or Headlamp:** The area behind the refrigerator can be dark. A light source makes it easier to see.

#### Safety Precautions

Electrical safety is paramount when working on appliances. Always assume power is present until you have taken steps to disconnect it. Neglecting safety can lead to severe injury or even fatality. I cannot stress this enough: your safety comes first.

*   **Unplug the Refrigerator:** This is the absolute first step. Pull the power cord directly from the wall outlet. Do not rely on turning off a switch. Confirm there is no power by trying to turn the refrigerator on.
*   **Wear Protective Gear:** Use work gloves to protect your hands. Safety glasses are also wise to shield your eyes from debris or unexpected sparks.
*   **Discharge Capacitors (if applicable):** While less common with start relays, some components can store an electrical charge. For a start relay, this is generally not an issue, but always be aware of potential stored energy in other parts of the refrigerator.
*   **Work in a Well-Lit Area:** Good lighting reduces the risk of errors and allows you to clearly see what you are doing.
*   **Keep Water Away:** Never work on electrical appliances near water or with wet hands. Water conducts electricity.
*   **Follow Instructions:** Always refer to your LG refrigerator's service manual if available. It provides specific safety warnings and disassembly instructions for your model.
*   **Stay Calm:** Take your time and avoid rushing. Haste can lead to mistakes and accidents.

By following these safety precautions, you ensure a much safer working environment. You can then proceed with confidence in testing your LG refrigerator's start relay.

### Locating the Start Relay on Your LG Refrigerator

Finding the start relay is a crucial step before you can test it. It is usually hidden from plain sight. Knowing where to look will save you time and effort. Most LG refrigerators follow a similar design for the compressor area. I will guide you through the process of locating this small but vital component.

#### Behind the Refrigerator

The start relay is always located at the back of your LG refrigerator. You need to pull the refrigerator away from the wall. This gives you enough space to work. Look for a large metal or plastic cover at the bottom rear of the appliance. This cover protects the compressor and other electrical components.

You will need a screwdriver or nut driver to remove this access panel. Store the screws in a safe place so you do not lose them. Once the panel is off, you will see the compressor. The compressor is a large, black, round, or oval-shaped component. It is usually quite heavy.

#### Compressor Terminal

The start relay is directly attached to the side of the compressor. It plugs into three prongs on the compressor's electrical terminal. These prongs are where the compressor receives power. The relay typically clips onto these prongs. It might have a small cover over it. This cover protects the electrical connections.

Carefully observe how the relay is connected. Some relays might also have a small wire harness plugged into them. Make a mental note or take a picture of the wiring. This will help you reassemble everything correctly later.

#### Identifying the Relay Type

LG refrigerators use different types of start relays. The most common types are:

*   **PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) Relay:** This type looks like a small, black box or puck. It uses a ceramic disc that heats up to change resistance.
*   **Current Relay:** This type is more common on older models. It looks like a small cylinder with a coil inside.

Knowing your relay type is not strictly necessary for testing its basic function. However, it can be helpful if you need to order a replacement part. Always make sure to get the exact part number from your existing relay or your refrigerator's model number. This ensures compatibility.

Once you have located the relay and observed its connections, you are ready to remove it. You might need to gently pry it off the compressor terminals. Some relays have retaining clips you need to release. Be careful not to break the prongs on the compressor itself. These prongs are delicate.

### Step-by-Step Visual Inspection of the LG Refrigerator Start Relay

Before you reach for your multimeter, a simple visual inspection of the LG refrigerator start relay can often reveal problems. This step is quick and requires no special tools. It can immediately tell you if the relay has suffered obvious damage. I always start with a visual check because it saves time if the issue is clear.

#### Remove the Relay

First, ensure your LG refrigerator is unplugged from the wall. You should have already removed the back access panel. Gently but firmly pull the start relay straight off the three prongs on the compressor. Sometimes, a slight wiggle helps. Be careful not to bend or break the compressor terminals. If there are any wires connected to the relay, disconnect them. Make a note of their positions if needed.

Once the relay is off, take it to a well-lit area. This allows for a thorough examination. Place it on a clean, flat surface.

#### Check for Burns, Cracks, or Swelling

Now, carefully examine the relay's exterior. Look for any signs of physical damage.

*   **Burn Marks:** Darkened or scorched areas on the relay's casing indicate overheating. This is a clear sign of internal electrical failure. Burn marks usually appear around the electrical terminals or where the relay connects to the compressor.
*   **Cracks:** Look for any cracks in the plastic casing. Cracks can mean the internal components are damaged or exposed. Even small hairline cracks can indicate a problem.
*   **Swelling or Bulging:** If any part of the relay looks swollen or bulging, it is a sign of internal component failure. This often happens due to excessive heat or electrical stress.
*   **Corrosion:** Check the electrical terminals for signs of rust or corrosion. Corroded terminals can prevent a good electrical connection. This also causes the relay to fail.

Any of these visual signs usually mean the start relay is faulty. It needs replacement. Even if the relay works intermittently, these signs suggest it is failing.

#### Shake for Rattling Sounds

The next part of your visual inspection is an auditory one. Hold the relay firmly in your hand. Gently shake it. Listen for any loose parts rattling inside the casing.

*   **Normal Sound (PTC Relay):** If you have a PTC-type relay, you might hear a very faint, almost imperceptible "clink" from the small ceramic disc inside. This is normal.
*   **Abnormal Sound (PTC Relay):** If you hear a clear, distinct rattle, it means the ceramic disc inside is broken or dislodged. A broken disc prevents the relay from functioning correctly.
*   **Normal Sound (Current Relay):** For a current relay, you might hear a slight click when you turn it upside down. This is the plunger moving inside. This is normal.
*   **Abnormal Sound (Current Relay):** A loud, persistent rattle in a current relay indicates that internal components are loose or broken. This also means the relay is faulty.

If your LG refrigerator start relay shows any of these visual flaws or makes a rattling sound, it is likely defective. It probably needs replacement. This simple check can save you the time of using a multimeter.

### Testing LG Refrigerator Start Relay with a Multimeter (Ohms)

After a visual inspection, the multimeter test provides a definitive answer about your LG refrigerator start relay's condition. This electrical test measures the relay's internal resistance and continuity. It tells you if the electrical path within the relay is open or closed, and if it has the correct resistance. I find this test very reliable for accurate diagnosis.

#### Setting Up the Multimeter

Before you begin, ensure your multimeter is set correctly.

1.  **Select Ohms (Î©):** Turn the dial on your multimeter to the Ohms (Î©) setting. This setting measures electrical resistance. Some multimeters have an auto-ranging feature. If yours does not, start with a lower Ohms range, like 200Î© or 2kÎ©.
2.  **Continuity Check:** Many multimeters also have a continuity setting. This setting usually beeps when there is a complete circuit. This is useful for a quick check.
3.  **Calibrate (if needed):** Touch the two probes of your multimeter together. The reading should be very close to zero ohms. This confirms your multimeter is working correctly.

#### Testing Continuity

Continuity testing checks if a circuit path is complete.

1.  **PTC Relay (Puck-style):**
    *   Locate the two small holes or terminals on the flat side of the relay where it connects to the compressor. These are typically the run and start winding terminals.
    *   Place one multimeter probe into each of these two holes.
    *   Your multimeter should show a very low resistance reading, typically between 0.5 to 1.5 Ohms. If it shows "OL" (Over Limit) or "1" (Open Circuit), the relay has no continuity, meaning it's bad. This indicates a broken internal connection.
2.  **Current Relay (Cylinder-style):**
    *   These relays typically have two terminals: one for the run winding and one for the start winding.
    *   Place one probe on each terminal.
    *   You should get a low resistance reading. An "OL" or "1" reading indicates no continuity, meaning the relay is faulty.

This test determines if the electrical path is open or closed. An open circuit means no electricity can flow through the relay, which will prevent the compressor from starting.

#### Testing Resistance

Measuring resistance gives you a more precise understanding of the relay's condition.

1.  **PTC Relay (Puck-style):**
    *   Again, place your probes into the two holes where the relay connects to the compressor's run and start terminals.
    *   The resistance reading should fall within a specific range, usually between 0.5 to 1.5 Ohms, when the relay is cold. A higher reading, or an "OL" reading, indicates a faulty PTC relay. The internal ceramic disc might be damaged or open.
2.  **Current Relay (Cylinder-style):**
    *   Place your probes on the two terminals.
    *   You should get a low resistance reading, typically in the range of 10 to 30 Ohms. This resistance is for the coil inside the relay. If you get "OL" or a reading significantly outside this range, the coil is likely broken, and the relay is bad.

Always refer to your LG refrigerator's service manual or the relay's specific part number for exact resistance specifications. While the general ranges apply, precise numbers ensure accuracy. If your readings deviate significantly from these expected values, your LG refrigerator start relay is likely faulty and needs replacement. This multimeter test is crucial for confirming your diagnosis.

### Interpreting Your Multimeter Readings for LG Refrigerator Start Relay

Understanding the numbers on your multimeter is key to knowing if your LG refrigerator start relay is faulty. The readings tell a clear story about the relay's internal health. I will explain what good readings look like and what bad readings indicate. This knowledge will help you make an informed decision.

#### What Good Readings Look Like

For a healthy LG refrigerator start relay, your multimeter should show specific readings. These readings confirm the relay can properly conduct electricity.

*   **PTC Relay (Puck-style):** When testing the two main terminals where it connects to the compressor, you should see a very low resistance. This reading typically falls between **0.5 to 1.5 Ohms**. If you use the continuity setting, the multimeter should beep, indicating a continuous circuit. This low resistance means the relay provides a clear path for electricity to flow. This is essential for the compressor to start.
*   **Current Relay (Cylinder-style):** When testing the coil terminals, a good current relay will show resistance generally between **10 to 30 Ohms**. This value represents the resistance of the coil inside the relay. If your multimeter beeps on the continuity setting, that is also a good sign for this type of relay.

These readings confirm the internal components are intact. They show the relay can perform its function correctly. Always make sure the relay is at room temperature when testing. Extreme temperatures can affect resistance readings.

#### What Bad Readings Look Like

Faulty LG refrigerator start relays will present very different readings. These readings tell you the relay is no longer functional.

*   **"OL" or "1" (Open Circuit):** This is the most common bad reading. "OL" stands for "Over Limit" or "Open Line." On some multimeters, it might just display a "1" on the far left side of the screen. This reading means there is infinite resistance. It indicates an open circuit, meaning electricity cannot flow through the relay. If you get this reading on a PTC relay, its ceramic disc is broken or dislodged. For a current relay, the internal coil is likely broken. In either case, the relay is bad.
*   **Very High Resistance:** If your multimeter shows a resistance reading significantly higher than the expected range (e.g., hundreds or thousands of Ohms for a PTC relay), the relay is compromised. This high resistance will prevent enough current from reaching the compressor.
*   **No Beep (on Continuity Setting):** If your multimeter is on the continuity setting and does not beep, it means the circuit is open. This is equivalent to an "OL" reading and indicates a faulty relay.

#### When to Replace

If your LG refrigerator start relay exhibits any of the following, it needs replacement:

*   **Visible damage:** Burn marks, cracks, or swelling.
*   **Rattling sound:** Indicates broken internal components.
*   **"OL" or "1" reading:** Shows an open circuit.
*   **Resistance outside the normal range:** Too high or significantly off.

Even if the relay passes a basic continuity test but shows intermittent symptoms in your refrigerator, consider replacing it. Sometimes, relays can fail under load, even if they show a good reading when cold. Replacing a faulty [LG refrigerator start relay](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-test-lg-refrigerator-evaporator-fan-motor) is often a cost-effective solution. It can restore your LG refrigerator's cooling function.

### Replacing a Faulty LG Refrigerator Start Relay

Once you have confirmed that your LG refrigerator start relay is faulty, the next step is to replace it. This is a relatively straightforward repair for most DIY enthusiasts. Proper replacement ensures your refrigerator starts cooling again. I have replaced many of these. It is satisfying to see the fridge come back to life.

#### Ordering the Correct Part

Before you remove the old relay permanently, ensure you have the correct replacement part.

*   **Model Number:** Write down your LG refrigerator's full model number. This is usually found on a sticker inside the refrigerator compartment or behind the kick plate.
*   **Part Number:** Ideally, find the part number directly on the old start relay itself. Sometimes, it is printed on the casing.
*   **Compatibility:** Use both the refrigerator model number and the relay part number to search for a new relay from a reputable appliance parts supplier. Ensure the new relay is compatible with your specific LG model. A common mistake is ordering a generic relay that does not match. This can cause more problems or simply not work.

Having the correct part beforehand means you can complete the repair quickly. You
