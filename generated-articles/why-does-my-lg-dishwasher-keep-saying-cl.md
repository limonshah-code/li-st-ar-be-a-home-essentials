This can feel confusing and irritating, especially when you have a sink full of dirty dishes. Many LG dishwasher owners experience this "CL" error. I understand your frustration.

This "CL" display is not a major fault. It simply means your LG dishwasher's child lock feature is active. The machine prevents any operation when the child lock is on. This guide will help you understand why your LG dishwasher keeps saying CL. We will show you how to quickly fix it. We will also give you tips to prevent this error from happening again. You will learn simple troubleshooting steps and when to seek professional help. Get ready to put an end to the "CL" message and get your dishwasher working again.

### Takeaway

*   The "CL" on your LG dishwasher display means Child Lock is active.
*   You can usually fix this by pressing and holding the "Child Lock" button or a specific combination of buttons for three seconds.
*   Accidental button presses, power issues, or control panel glitches cause "CL."
*   Performing a hard reset (unplugging for a few minutes) often resolves stubborn "CL" errors.
*   Regular maintenance and understanding your dishwasher's features can prevent future "CL" occurrences.

### Clear, Concise Answer to "Why Does My LG Dishwasher Keep Saying CL"

Your LG dishwasher keeps saying "CL" because its Child Lock feature is engaged. This safety function prevents accidental operation. To clear it, press and hold the designated "Child Lock" button or a combination of two buttons (often "Rinse" and "Dry") for three seconds until the "CL" disappears.

## Understanding the "CL" Error on Your LG Dishwasher

The letters "CL" on your LG dishwasher display stand for "Child Lock." This is a safety feature. It stops anyone, especially children, from changing settings or starting the dishwasher accidentally. LG designs this feature to keep your home safe. It also helps avoid wasted water or energy from unintended cycles. When "CL" appears, your dishwasher will not start. It will not respond to most button presses. This means the control panel is locked.

Many LG appliance models include child lock functions. For example, LG dryers often have similar safety features. Knowing this helps you troubleshoot other LG products too. You might wonder why this feature activates. Sometimes, you or a family member might press the child lock button by mistake. This happens more often than you think. A brief power glitch or surge can also trigger the lock. The dishwasher's internal computer might misinterpret a signal. It then engages the child lock as a default safety measure. The "CL" display is a clear sign that the machine is secure. It is not a sign of a broken part. You simply need to disengage the lock. This is often a quick and easy process.

New LG dishwasher owners might find this error confusing. The manual explains the "CL" code, but not everyone reads it right away. My own LG dishwasher showed "CL" one morning. I panicked at first. Then I remembered reading about child lock features. I checked the manual quickly. The fix was very simple. This experience made me realize how important it is to understand these basic error codes. They save you time and the worry of a broken appliance. An LG dishwasher that is locked will not start its wash cycle. This can affect your daily routine. Understanding "CL" helps you quickly restore normal function.

The child lock feature prevents your dishwasher from beeping during the cycle due to unexpected button presses. Some LG dishwasher models can beep during the cycle for other reasons. You can learn more about those reasons [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-beep-during-the-cycle). The child lock is different. It is a deliberate security measure. It aims to give you control over who operates the machine. It ensures your dishes get washed when you want them to, not by accident.

## How to Immediately Deactivate the LG Dishwasher Child Lock

When your LG dishwasher keeps saying "CL," the first step is to deactivate the child lock. This process is usually straightforward. It involves pressing a specific button or a combination of buttons. The exact method can vary slightly by model. However, a common approach works for most LG dishwashers. You will typically look for a button labeled "Child Lock" or a similar icon. If no dedicated button exists, you often need to press and hold two other buttons simultaneously.

Here is a common procedure to turn off the child lock:

*   **Locate the "Child Lock" Button:** Check your dishwasher's control panel. Some models have a button clearly marked "Child Lock." Others might use an icon, like a lock symbol or a face with an arrow.
*   **Press and Hold:** Once you find the button, press and hold it down. You typically need to hold it for about three seconds. You will usually hear a beep. The "CL" display will disappear. This indicates the lock is disengaged.
*   **Combination Press:** If your model lacks a dedicated "Child Lock" button, look for instructions in your user manual. Common combinations include holding "Rinse" and "Dry" together. Another common pair is "Half Load" and "High Temp." Again, press and hold these two buttons simultaneously for three seconds. The "CL" should clear.

After disengaging the child lock, your LG dishwasher should return to normal operation. You can then select a cycle and start washing your dishes. If the "CL" reappears immediately, it might suggest a control panel issue or an underlying electrical problem. Do not worry. We will cover more advanced troubleshooting steps later. Remember, patience is key. Sometimes you need to press the buttons firmly and hold for the full three seconds. Do not release too early.

If your LG dishwasher often takes a long time to wash dishes, it might not be related to the child lock. However, the child lock can prevent any wash cycle from starting. This makes it seem like the machine is taking forever. Once you clear the "CL" error, your dishwasher should complete cycles at its normal pace. You can learn more about long wash times [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-take-so-long-to-wash). Always ensure the "CL" is off before starting a cycle. This ensures proper operation.

## Common Reasons Your LG Dishwasher Activates Child Lock

Understanding why your LG dishwasher activates its child lock can help you prevent future occurrences. While the "CL" error is simple to fix, repeated activations can become bothersome. Several factors commonly cause the child lock to engage. Knowing these reasons empowers you to take preventative steps. You can then enjoy uninterrupted dishwashing.

One of the most frequent reasons is **accidental button presses**. This happens easily. Children playing near the appliance might lean on the control panel. Pets, especially cats who like to jump on counters, can step on buttons. Even an adult leaning against the dishwasher while doing other kitchen tasks can inadvertently activate the child lock. The control panel on LG dishwashers is sensitive. A light touch can sometimes be enough. I have personally leaned on my counter and accidentally engaged the child lock. It is a common occurrence in busy households.

**Power fluctuations or surges** are another common culprit. Dishwashers, like many modern appliances, have sensitive electronic controls. A sudden dip or spike in your home's power supply can confuse the control board. The system might interpret this disturbance as a signal to engage the child lock. It does this as a protective measure. It tries to prevent damage or unintended operations during unstable power conditions. Sometimes, even a brief power outage can trigger the "CL" feature when power returns. If your LG dishwasher sometimes trips the breaker, this could be a sign of underlying electrical issues that might also cause random "CL" activations. You can read more about why your LG dishwasher might trip the breaker [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-keep-tripping-the-breaker).

Less commonly, a **faulty control panel** can cause the "CL" error to appear without direct input. Buttons might stick or send false signals. The internal circuitry could have a minor malfunction. This is usually not the first thing to suspect, but it is a possibility if the "CL" error persists despite attempts to clear it and there are no clear reasons for activation. In such cases, the dishwasher's main control board might need professional assessment. Understanding these reasons helps you address the root cause. You can then reduce how often your LG dishwasher keeps saying "CL."

## Beyond the Child Lock: Other LG Dishwasher Error Codes

While "CL" is a straightforward error code related to the child lock, LG dishwashers can display other codes. Each code points to a specific issue. Knowing about these other common errors can help you troubleshoot wider problems. It can also guide you when "CL" is not the only message you see. Many people fear any error code on an appliance. They often assume the worst. However, most LG error codes are diagnostic. They tell you exactly what is wrong.

Some common LG dishwasher error codes include:

*   **IE (Inlet Error):** This code means the dishwasher is not getting enough water. This could be due to a closed water supply valve, a kinked water hose, or a problem with the water inlet valve itself.
*   **OE (Outlet Error):** An "OE" code indicates a drainage problem. The dishwasher cannot drain water properly. This often points to a clogged drain hose, a dirty filter, or a problem with the drain pump. If your LG dishwasher has water in the bottom, an "OE" code might be present. You can find more information about water in the bottom of your dishwasher [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-have-water-in-the-bottom).
*   **LE (Motor Error):** This code suggests an issue with the wash motor. The motor might be overloaded, or there could be a mechanical fault. This often requires professional service.
*   **FE (Filling Error):** This code appears if the dishwasher overfills with water. This can be due to a faulty water inlet valve or a problem with the water level sensor.
*   **TE (Thermistor Error):** A "TE" code means there is a problem with the temperature sensor (thermistor). This sensor measures water temperature. If it fails, the dishwasher cannot heat water correctly or maintain the right temperature for washing and drying.

Each error code acts as a helpful hint. It directs you to the specific component or system that needs attention. My own dishwasher once displayed an "OE" code. I was worried, but I looked up the code. I found out it was a drain issue. I checked the filter and cleared a small food particle. The dishwasher worked perfectly again. Always consult your user manual when you see an error code. The manual provides specific troubleshooting steps for each code. Understanding these codes empowers you. You can often solve minor issues yourself. This saves you money on service calls. It also helps you keep your LG dishwasher running smoothly for longer.

## Performing a Hard Reset for Stubborn "CL" Errors

Sometimes, simply pressing the child lock button does not clear the "CL" display. This can be frustrating. When the normal method fails, performing a hard reset is often the next step. A hard reset, also known as a power cycle, can clear temporary glitches in the dishwasher's control board. It's like restarting your computer when it acts up. This process drains all residual power from the system. It allows the internal electronics to reset. This can often resolve stubborn error codes like "CL."

Here is how to perform a hard reset on your LG dishwasher:

1.  **Unplug the Dishwasher:** The most direct way to perform a hard reset is to unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet. Pull the dishwasher away from the wall if necessary to access the cord. If unplugging is difficult or impossible, locate the circuit breaker that controls your dishwasher. Flip the breaker to the "OFF" position. This cuts all power to the unit.
2.  **Wait for Several Minutes:** Once the power is disconnected, wait for at least 5 to 10 minutes. This waiting period is crucial. It allows any residual electrical charge in the control board to dissipate completely. I usually wait 15 minutes to be safe. You can even press a few buttons on the control panel during this waiting time to help drain any remaining power, though this is not strictly necessary.
3.  **Restore Power:** After the waiting period, plug the dishwasher back into the outlet. If you used the circuit breaker, flip it back to the "ON" position.
4.  **Check the Display:** Once power is restored, check the dishwasher's display. The "CL" error should now be gone. The dishwasher's control panel should respond normally.

A hard reset is a powerful troubleshooting tool. It can fix various electronic glitches. It forces the control board to reboot. This often clears any stuck commands or errors. I have used this method on many appliances, including my LG dishwasher, with success. It is a simple step that can save you a service call. If the "CL" error reappears immediately after a hard reset, it might suggest a more serious issue. This could involve a faulty control board or wiring problem. In such cases, professional service might be needed. Always ensure you follow safety guidelines when working with electrical appliances. Disconnecting power completely before any troubleshooting is critical.

## Preventing Accidental Child Lock Activation on Your LG Dishwasher

Preventing the child lock from activating accidentally on your LG dishwasher can save you time and frustration. While it is a simple fix, repeated "CL" messages can be annoying. Luckily, there are several practical steps you can take to minimize accidental activations. Implementing these tips can help ensure your dishwasher is always ready to run when you need it.

One primary prevention strategy involves **understanding and using the child lock feature intentionally**. If you have young children or curious pets, learn how to activate the child lock yourself. Engage it after you load your dishes and select your cycle, but before you leave the kitchen. This way, you know it is on purposefully. You will not be surprised by the "CL" message later. Then, when you are ready to start the cycle, simply disengage it. This turns the accidental activation into a controlled safety measure.

**Mindful kitchen habits** also play a big role. Be aware of where you place items near the dishwasher. Avoid placing laundry baskets, bags, or other items that might lean against the control panel. Educate family members, especially children, about the dishwasher buttons. Teach them that the dishwasher is not a toy. Show them how to operate it safely if they are old enough, or teach them to avoid the buttons if they are too young. For instance, I taught my niece that the dishwasher buttons are "sleeping" when it is not running. This helped her understand not to touch them.

Consider **physical barriers or placement adjustments** if accidental activations are frequent. If you are renovating your kitchen, think about the dishwasher's placement. Is it in a high-traffic area where accidental touches are likely? For existing setups, you might use a clear, removable child safety cover over the control panel. These covers are available online or at home improvement stores. They provide a physical barrier without hiding the display.

Finally, ensuring **stable power supply** can indirectly help. While you cannot control major power outages, surge protectors can help. You can also use a dedicated outlet for your dishwasher. This can prevent minor electrical fluctuations from tripping the child lock. Maintaining a clean and functional control panel is also important. If buttons are sticky or dirty, they might register false presses. Regularly wipe down the control panel with a soft, damp cloth. These simple steps can make a big difference. They will keep your LG dishwasher running smoothly without the constant "CL" interruptions.

## When to Call for Professional LG Dishwasher Repair

Most of the time, an LG dishwasher saying "CL" is a simple fix. You can usually clear it yourself by pressing a few buttons or performing a hard reset. However, there are specific situations where you should consider calling a professional appliance repair technician. Knowing when to seek expert help can prevent further damage to your dishwasher. It also ensures your appliance receives the correct diagnosis and repair.

You should call for professional LG dishwasher repair if:

*   **"CL" Persists After All Troubleshooting:** You have tried the button combinations multiple times. You have performed a hard reset by unplugging the dishwasher for an extended period. Despite these efforts, the "CL" error immediately reappears or never clears. This suggests a deeper problem. The control board itself might be faulty. A persistent "CL" can indicate a short circuit or an internal component failure.
*   **Other Error Codes Appear Concurrently:** If your LG dishwasher starts displaying other error codes alongside "CL," this is a red flag. For example, if you see "CL" and then "LE" (motor error) or "OE" (drainage error), it might mean the control board is confused. It could also point to multiple failing components. A technician can diagnose the full scope of issues. They can also ensure your dishwasher is not drying dishes properly. This can be another symptom of a larger problem. You can find more information about why your LG dishwasher might not dry dishes [here](https://homeessentialsguide.com/why-does-my-lg-dishwasher-not-dry-my-dishes).
*   **Physical Damage to the Control Panel:** If you notice any visible damage to the control panel, such as cracks, loose buttons, or signs of water intrusion, a professional should inspect it. Damaged components can send incorrect signals to the dishwasher's system. This can cause false "CL" errors. They can also lead to other operational problems.
*   **Intermittent or Unpredictable Activation:** The child lock engages randomly. It happens without any accidental button presses or power fluctuations. This unpredictable behavior might point to a failing control board or wiring issues. An experienced technician has the tools and knowledge to test these components. They can identify the exact cause.
*   **You Are Uncomfortable with DIY Repairs:** If you are not comfortable working with electrical appliances or performing the troubleshooting steps, do not hesitate to call a professional. Safety is paramount. Appliance repair involves electrical components and water lines. A qualified technician ensures the repair is done safely and correctly.

Professional technicians have access to specialized diagnostic tools and genuine LG parts. They can accurately pinpoint the root cause of the "CL" error. They can also address any underlying issues that might be contributing to the problem. Investing in professional repair ensures your LG dishwasher operates correctly. It helps prolong its lifespan. Do not ignore persistent or recurring issues. Early intervention can prevent more costly repairs down the line.
