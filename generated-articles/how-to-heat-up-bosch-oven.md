Conventional heat, sometimes called "bake" or "top/bottom heat," uses elements at the top and bottom of the oven. This mode provides gentle, even heat from both directions. It is ideal for most baking and roasting tasks. Use it for cakes, cookies, casseroles, and meats. Heat circulates naturally within the oven cavity. This is a standard setting for everyday cooking.

### Convection/Fan Heat

Convection mode adds a fan, and often an extra heating element, to circulate hot air. This creates a more even and consistent temperature throughout the oven. Convection reduces cooking time by up to 25%. It also ensures browning and crisping on all sides. This mode is excellent for roasting vegetables, poultry, and multiple trays of cookies. It helps to prevent hot spots. When using convection, you may need to reduce the temperature by 25°F (15°C) from a conventional recipe.

### Grill/Broil Function

The grill or broil function uses the top heating element at high intensity. This provides direct, intense heat from above. It is perfect for browning the top of casseroles, toasting bread, or searing meats. Use this mode with caution. Food can burn quickly under the broiler. Keep a close eye on your dish. Position your oven rack properly for the best results.

### Specific Modes (e.g., Pizza, Dough Proving)

Many Bosch ovens feature specialized heating modes. These modes are designed for particular foods or processes. For example, a "Pizza" mode often combines bottom heat with fan assistance for a crispy crust. A "Dough Proving" mode provides a low, consistent temperature for rising dough.
