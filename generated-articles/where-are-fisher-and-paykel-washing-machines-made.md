## The Evolution of Fisher & Paykel Washing Machine Manufacturing

Let us explore the journey of Fisher & Paykel. The brand began its life as a New Zealand company. It built a strong reputation for innovation and quality appliances. This early history shaped how the company approached product creation.

### New Zealand Roots and Early Innovations

Fisher & Paykel started in 1934 in New Zealand. Maurice Paykel and Woolf Fisher founded the company. They first imported refrigerators and washing machines. Soon, they began manufacturing their own appliances.
