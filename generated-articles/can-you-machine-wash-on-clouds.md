## Can You Machine Wash On Clouds

Running shoes take a beating. They get dirty, muddy, and sometimes even smelly. You love your On Clouds for their comfort and performance. Keeping them clean feels important. Many people wonder if they can machine wash On Clouds. It is a common question. I understand wanting to clean them quickly.

This article answers that question directly. We will explore the best ways to clean your beloved On Running shoes. You will learn about safe machine washing practices. We also cover gentle hand washing methods. Understanding your shoe materials helps choose the right cleaning path. My goal is to help you keep your On Clouds looking great. This guide offers practical steps for extending their life.

### Takeaway

*   **Avoid Harsh Cycles:** Always use a delicate or cold water cycle. Hot water can damage shoe materials.
*   **Protect Your Shoes:** Place shoes in a mesh laundry bag. This prevents banging and snagging.
*   **Remove Insoles and Laces:** Wash these separately or by hand. They clean better on their own.
*   **Air Dry Only:** Never use a dryer. High heat warps shoes and degrades adhesive.
*   **Spot Clean Regularly:** Address small stains quickly. This reduces the need for full washes.

### Can You Machine Wash On Clouds? A Direct Answer

Yes, you can machine wash On Clouds, but with great caution. It is possible under specific, gentle conditions. You must use a cold, delicate cycle. Always place the shoes in a mesh laundry bag. Air drying is essential afterwards. Following these steps helps minimize damage.

### Understanding Your On Clouds: Material Matters for Washing

On Running shoes, commonly called On Clouds, feature special designs. These designs use various materials. Their performance depends on these specific components. Knowing these materials helps you clean your shoes correctly. Each part needs careful handling. Machine washing can be harsh on delicate parts.

Most On Cloud models use a breathable mesh upper. This mesh provides comfort and ventilation. It is often a synthetic blend. The famous CloudTec® sole uses rubber "clouds." These individual pods offer unique cushioning. They flex and compress with your foot. The shoes also include foam insoles and fabric laces. All these parts react differently to washing. Understanding these differences helps protect your investment.

When you machine wash On Clouds, consider what each material tolerates. The mesh can withstand water and gentle soap. However, aggressive agitation might fray it. The rubber clouds are durable, but hot water can affect their shape. Foam insoles can absorb water and break down with heat. Laces are usually sturdy. Always read any care labels if they are present on your specific model.

#### Mesh Uppers and CloudTec Soles

The mesh uppers on On Clouds are lightweight. They allow air to circulate. This keeps your feet cool and dry. This material is generally safe for cold water washing. Still, avoid strong scrubbing or harsh chemicals. These can damage the mesh fibers. I always advise a gentle approach.

The CloudTec® soles are unique to On shoes. They are made from a special type of rubber foam. These "clouds" provide their signature cushioning. Hot water is a major enemy for these soles. It can cause the rubber to soften or even deform. This changes the shoe's fit and performance. Stick to cold water for all washing. This preserves the integrity of your CloudTec® technology.

#### Laces and Insoles

Laces on On Clouds are typically made of polyester or nylon. These materials are very durable. They can handle machine washing without problems. However, they can get tangled in the wash. I recommend removing them. Wash them separately in a mesh bag. This keeps them from tangling around other items or the machine's agitator.

Insoles provide extra cushioning and support. They are often made of foam or a synthetic blend. Foam can absorb a lot of water. It takes longer to dry. Some insoles have antibacterial coatings. Machine washing can sometimes strip these away. For best results, remove your insoles before washing. You can hand wash them with mild soap. Allow them to air dry completely. This keeps them fresh and functional.

### Preparing Your On Clouds for a Machine Wash

Proper preparation makes a big difference. It protects your shoes and your washing machine. Do not just throw them in directly. A few simple steps prevent damage. This also ensures a better clean. Take a moment to get everything ready. It will save you effort later.

First, remove all loose dirt. Mud, small stones, and debris can cause issues. They can scratch your shoes. They can also clog your washing machine's filter. A little pre-cleaning goes a long way. This step is often overlooked. It is vital for a successful wash.

Next, disassemble parts that can be separated. This includes laces and insoles. Washing them separately ensures a thorough clean. It also protects the shoes. These components can snag or get lost. Taking these few minutes is worth it. It ensures everything comes out clean and undamaged.

#### Removing Dirt and Debris

Begin by knocking your shoes together outside. This loosens dried mud and dirt. Use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away grime. Pay attention to the soles. The CloudTec® elements can trap small rocks. A toothpick or a small stick helps dislodge stubborn bits. Rinse the soles under cool water. This removes more surface dirt. This step prevents dirt from spreading in the wash. [How to Clean White On Clouds](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-on-clouds) offers more specific advice for lighter-colored shoes. This initial cleaning saves wear on your washing machine.

#### Separating Components

Take out the laces from both shoes. Put them in a small mesh laundry bag. This stops them from tangling. It also prevents them from wrapping around parts inside the washing machine. Next, remove the insoles. Most On Cloud insoles are removable. Check your specific model if you are unsure. Hand wash insoles separately with mild soap and water. Then, let them air dry flat. This keeps them from losing their shape. These steps protect the smaller parts. They also help your shoes get cleaner overall.

### The Step-by-Step Guide to Machine Washing On Clouds

Machine washing your On Clouds is possible. However, it requires a careful approach. Following specific steps helps keep your shoes in good condition. My aim is to guide you through this process safely. This minimizes any risk of damage. You want clean shoes, not ruined ones.

First, always use cold water. Cold water protects the materials and adhesives. Hot water can cause shoes to shrink or fall apart. Next, choose the right cycle. A delicate or hand wash cycle is best. This setting uses less agitation. It is much gentler on your footwear. Finally, use a mild detergent. Harsh chemicals can strip shoe materials.

Place your prepared shoes into a mesh laundry bag. You can put both shoes in one large bag. Alternatively, use separate smaller bags. This protects the shoes from banging against the drum. It also prevents snags. This simple step is critical for machine washing shoes. It offers a layer of protection. For general advice on washing footwear, you can refer to [How to Machine Wash Shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-machine-wash-shoes).

#### Choosing the Right Cycle and Temperature

Selecting the correct wash cycle is crucial. Choose the "delicate" or "hand wash" setting. Some machines also have a "cold water" only cycle. These settings reduce agitation. Reduced agitation is key to protecting your shoes. Stronger cycles can cause shoes to stretch or deform. They can also damage the stitching. I always use the gentlest option available.

Always use cold water. I cannot stress this enough. Hot water can weaken the adhesives that hold your shoes together. It can also cause the mesh to shrink. Furthermore, hot water can deform the CloudTec® sole components. This affects the shoe's performance and comfort. Cold water cleans effectively without these risks. It preserves the shoe's structure.

#### Protecting Your Shoes in the Wash

To further protect your On Clouds, place them inside a mesh laundry bag. This bag acts as a cushion. It prevents your shoes from banging against the washing machine drum. It also stops laces and other small parts from getting caught. If you do not have a mesh bag, an old pillowcase works well. Tie the pillowcase closed.

Add a few old towels to the wash. The towels provide extra cushioning. They absorb some of the impact during the wash cycle. This prevents the shoes from slamming around too much. Use towels that are colorfast. You do not want dye transferring to your clean shoes. This simple trick adds another layer of safety. It makes the washing process much gentler.

### Why Hand Washing Might Be a Better Option for Your On Clouds

While machine washing is convenient, hand washing often provides a gentler clean. It allows for more control. You can target specific dirty areas. It also reduces the risk of damage to delicate materials. I often choose hand washing for my favorite shoes. It just feels safer.

Hand washing is especially good for stubborn stains. You can apply cleaner directly to the problem spot. You can also control the amount of scrubbing. This avoids over-agitating the entire shoe. It helps maintain the shoe's original shape and structure. Hand washing also prolongs the shoe's life. It is less harsh on adhesives and stitching.

Sometimes, a full machine wash is not necessary. If only a small part of your shoe is dirty, spot cleaning is enough. Hand washing methods are great for this. You can clean just the dirty area. This saves water and detergent. It also reduces wear on the whole shoe. [How to Wash Shoes Without Washing Machine](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-shoes-without-washing-machine) provides excellent guidance for this approach.

#### Targeting Tough Stains by Hand

For tough stains, hand washing is your best tool. Mix a small amount of mild laundry detergent with water. Create a soapy solution. Dip a soft brush or cloth into this mixture. Gently scrub the stained area. Work in small circles. Avoid rubbing too hard. This can push the stain deeper into the fabric.

For mud or dirt, let it dry first. Then, brush it off with a dry brush. This prevents smearing the mud. For oil-based stains, use a small amount of dish soap. Dish soap is good at cutting grease. Always rinse the area thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Blot the area dry with a clean towel. Repeat if necessary. This targeted approach is very effective.

#### Preserving Shoe Integrity

Hand washing helps preserve your shoe's form. Machine washing can sometimes warp or stretch shoes. The strong tumbling action is hard on delicate materials. Hand washing means you control the pressure. You control the water temperature. This ensures the shoes keep their shape. It keeps the CloudTec® sole intact.

Hand washing also protects the adhesive bonds. On Clouds use various glues to hold components together. Excessive heat or harsh agitation can weaken these bonds. Hand washing uses cooler temperatures and gentle action. This extends the life of your shoes. It keeps them looking new longer. It also protects the unique cushioning system.

### Drying Your On Clouds: The Critical Final Step

Drying your On Clouds correctly is as important as washing them. Incorrect drying methods can cause irreparable damage. Heat is the biggest enemy of your running shoes. It can shrink, warp, or even melt shoe components. Always allow ample time for drying. Patience is key in this final stage.

The best method for drying is air drying. This means letting your shoes dry naturally. It avoids any heat exposure. Air drying preserves the shoe's shape and material integrity. It also prevents the breakdown of adhesives. I always find a well-ventilated spot for my shoes. This ensures proper airflow.

Never use a tumble dryer. The high heat is damaging. Never use a direct heat source either. This includes radiators or hair dryers. Even direct sunlight can be too intense. These methods can undo all your careful washing efforts. They can ruin your expensive On Clouds.

#### Proper Air Drying Techniques

After washing, remove your On Clouds from the mesh bag. Gently blot them with a clean towel. This removes excess water. You can also stuff the shoes with white paper towels or newspaper. This helps absorb moisture from the inside. It also helps the shoes maintain their shape as they dry. Change the paper every few hours. Avoid using colored paper. The ink can transfer to your shoes.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. A spot with good airflow is ideal. Keep them away from direct sunlight or heat sources. An indoor room with an open window works well. Drying can take 24 to 48 hours. This depends on humidity levels. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them. Wearing damp shoes can cause odors. It can also encourage mildew growth.

#### Why Heat is the Enemy

Heat is destructive to many shoe materials. On Clouds are no exception. The rubberized CloudTec® sole can soften and deform with heat. This changes its cushioning properties. The EVA foam in the midsole can also compress permanently. This leads to a loss of support. Your shoes will not feel the same.

The glues and adhesives holding the shoes together are heat-sensitive. High temperatures can weaken these bonds. This causes parts of the shoe to separate. The mesh upper can also shrink or become brittle. This compromises its flexibility and comfort. Avoid all forms of artificial heat. This includes dryers, heaters, and even prolonged direct sunlight. Protecting your shoes from heat ensures their longevity. It keeps them performing as designed.

### Extending the Life of Your On Clouds: Maintenance Tips

Keeping your On Clouds in top condition involves more than just washing. Regular maintenance habits contribute significantly. These practices prevent dirt buildup. They also protect the materials from daily wear. A little effort often means a longer life for your shoes. You get more miles out of them.

Think about shoe care as a continuous process. Do not wait until your shoes are heavily soiled. Small, consistent actions are more effective. They keep your shoes looking and feeling better. This proactive approach saves time and effort in the long run. It also protects your investment.

Proper storage is another key element. How you store your shoes impacts their condition. Protecting them from environmental factors is important. These simple habits make a big difference. They help your On Clouds stay fresh and functional.

#### Routine Spot Cleaning

Do not wait for a full wash. Spot clean your On Clouds regularly. If you get a small mud splatter, wipe it off immediately. Use a damp cloth and mild soap. This prevents the stain from setting. It keeps your shoes looking cleaner day-to-day. You will need to machine wash them less often. This extends their overall lifespan.

For white or light-colored shoes, spot cleaning is even more crucial. Small marks show up easily. Addressing them quickly keeps your shoes bright. A soft brush can remove dried dirt. A gentle wipe with a damp cloth can handle scuffs. This approach maintains a fresh appearance. It also protects the fabric from deep stains.

#### Smart Storage Solutions

How you store your On Clouds matters. Store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade colors. It can also weaken materials over time. Do not store them in damp areas. Dampness promotes mold and mildew growth. This can cause unpleasant odors. It can also damage the shoe fabric.

Use shoe trees or stuff them with paper. This helps them keep their shape. It prevents creases or flattening. If you have the original shoe box, use it. This protects them from dust. It also helps maintain their form. Proper storage keeps your shoes ready for your next run. It ensures they stay comfortable and supportive.
