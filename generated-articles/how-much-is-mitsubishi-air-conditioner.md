I found that matching the system to my specific needs helped avoid overspending or under-performing.

### Single-Zone Mini-Split Systems

These systems are perfect for cooling one specific area, like a bedroom, office, or garage. A single-zone system includes one outdoor unit connected to one indoor unit. They do not require ductwork, making installation simpler and less invasive. This is why many people choose them for additions or rooms that never quite feel cool enough.

*   **Unit Cost:** $800 - $2,500
*   **Installed Cost:** $2,500 - $5,000

The price for a single-zone system depends on the cooling capacity (BTUs) and the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) rating. Higher SEER ratings usually mean lower energy bills. My research showed that even a basic single-zone unit offers significant comfort improvements.

### Multi-Zone Mini-Split Systems

Multi-zone systems allow you to connect multiple indoor units to a single outdoor unit. This means you can cool several rooms or areas independently, each with its own temperature control. This setup is ideal for larger homes or multiple spaces requiring separate climate management. I considered this for my house to avoid cooling unused rooms.

*   **Unit Cost (2-4 zones):** $2,500 - $8,000
*   **Installed Cost (2-4 zones):** $6,000 - $12,000+

The cost scales up with the number of indoor units and their combined cooling capacity. More complex installations with longer refrigerant lines or more indoor units will also increase the overall price. Mitsubishi offers systems that can handle up to eight indoor units on one outdoor unit, giving incredible flexibility.

### Ducted Central Air Systems

While Mitsubishi is famous for ductless options, they also offer ducted solutions, often as part of their P-Series or City Multi lines. These systems integrate with your home's existing ductwork or require new duct installation. They provide whole-home cooling through vents. This is a more traditional approach for some larger homes.

*   **Unit Cost:** $3,000 - $10,000+
*   **Installed Cost:** $7,000 - $15,000+ (can be higher for extensive new ductwork)

Installation costs for ducted systems can be higher due to the labor involved in modifying or installing ductwork. These systems are often chosen for new constructions or major renovations where ducting is a planned part of the home design. They offer consistent cooling throughout the entire living space.

### Commercial and Specialty Systems

Mitsubishi also produces robust air conditioning solutions for commercial applications and larger residential properties. These include high-capacity units and specialized systems like Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) technology. VRF systems are extremely efficient for large buildings with many zones. Their costs are significantly higher due to their scale and complexity.
